01x10 - New York's JoJoQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:47We all know this old man! We've seen that look, we've seen that scar! Long has it been, Mr. Speedwagon.I've heard of your great success in America's oil business.I'd call it meager, if anything at all.But how I envy your youthful face, Master Straits.You couldn't possibly be 75, as I.I suppose it's due to your Ripple Respiration.If only I could have had the aptitude as well.It has been 49 years since Jonathan's passing, and the times and generation have all moved on.Straits became the Lama of the Art of Mystics, and Robert Edward O.Speedwagon became an oil baron.They would now fly to Mexico to investigate certain ruins.Certain ruins that were discovered by the Speedwagon Foundation's archaeological team, containing certain artifacts that only Straits and Speedwagon were familiar with.What you are about to see will most likely stun, no, will without a doubt, shock your spine its every segment into terror! You will feel greater disgust than you did 50 years ago! Greater than the disgust Dio drowned us all in! This is quite the grand hall! Master Straits, I asked you here because of this! T-This is the stone mask! There are several stone masks as well! 1938 New York It was the autumn of 1938.I was marking folks, my routine ring-a-rounds around town.Come again, son? You've never heard of Coco-Cola?! Son, I'm hearing a bit of ol' Blighty in yer voice.Are you a tourist? Oh, so you immigrated over recently? Anywho, yer gonna hav'ta pay first.Money's the law of the land 'round here.Hey! My British buddy, he snatched yer wallet! Get after him! What a chump! My best snatch today! What's up, Smokey? Yer my best snatch today! Caught in the act, in fact! Don't run, you filthy five-fingering hood! I'll make sure yer black butt's going in the big house for the next twenty years! Please Officer Ferman! All I did was snatch a wallet! Stop singing, you moon cricket! I hate you and all yer kind! But I'm a generous guy, see.From now on, yer gonna be bringing me $20 every week.That, and half of yer "earnings," too! Pardon me.Well if it ain't the chump who got his wallet snatched.I'm gonna keep this as evidence, so scram.Well sir, here's the thing I gave him that wallet, Officer.Unbelievably, that 6-foot-4-or-so British boy came to save my butt from being busted.So, would you be so kind as to unhand both him and his wallet? Come again?! I gave him that wallet because he's my mate, he is.Would you unhand him? Yer friend, eh? Why don'tcha tell me his name then? You don't know his name, do you? Do you wanna end up in the big house for obstruction of justice? Well do you, my bumbling Brit? If you wouldn't mind me asking, why would you, an officer of the law, smear your boogie on me? The aim of such an action befuddles the brain.There don't have to be any "aim!" I can do whatever I want and yer cheer is making me mad, you mook! If you want me to smear your left cheek, then face the other-! The only thing I'm hearing from you is bollocks, Bobby! You limey loon! You're under arrest! Go on and sh**t! You won't get a sh*t off though! When you pull that trigger back, I'll snap your trigger finger in half! Like a matchstick! Not from where I'm standing! I'll blow a b*llet through yer brain! It was then, that I saw his body glow with a little bit of light.Whatever magic he used, it caused the bottle cap to explode from the bottle, breaking the copper's trigger finger! I lost my temper again! O-Oh no Na-Nanna Erina will throw a fit.T-This cr*cker's crazy! After everything he's done to these two coppers, how could he even be afraid of a scolding from "Nanna Erina?!" Hey, Pickpocket! Let's skedaddle on outta here! I asked how he made that bottle cap explode off its top, but even he didn't know "how." He says he could always do these "tricks," ever since he was a kid.According to him, his grandfather, who d*ed young, could do the exact same thing, but his father, who d*ed a fighter pilot during the Great w*r, couldn't.His mother wasn't around for him, either.I owe you one for helping me out.My name's Smokey.What's yours? Joestar.Joseph Joestar.Battle Tendency JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE Episode Joseph the Yank But call me Jojo.Who Who is the man embedded in this pillar?! It's no carving, that much I can tell! He has amino acids, living cells, body temperature, and a pulse! He is very alive! Master Straits, I don't care about what he is, how long he's lived, what his relation to these stone masks is, or what his purpose on God's green Earth is! I asked you here for one single reason.While he sleeps, I want you to k*ll him and all these stone masks with the Ripple! That is all I ask! How is Joseph Joestar? How does he fare? I seem to recall hearing that he used the Ripple to rescue you.Why do you ask? I believe it happened when he was 13.Yes, it was when your plane was h*jacked, and you were held hostage for ransom.Boyo! We need yer rump up front.Get up and go.You h*jacked Great-Uncle Speedwagon's plane to hold him hostage, right? We might be on this flight together, but I'm not worth a thing to you.Leave me to my comic papers and go about your business.I'll have no back-talk from ye, boyo! Jojo! C-Crikey! Being struck by these stooges doesn't bother him, but Jojo's easily infuriated over soiling the clothes Erina bought for him! Jojo, don't be hasty now! Hijacking and holding our flight for ransom would imply that you three were also prepared to have a crash landing as well, right?! Was that the Ripple?! The boyo's bonkers! He's trying to k*ll us all! We can't fly! Grab the controls! Hey, we're jumping so grab a seat! You are the most reckless, thoughtless boy I know! I'm not thoughtless.If anything, my head goes in every direction when it comes to protecting you and Nanna Erina.You both are all I have to call "family." He has Jonathan's face, but he'll never be the gentleman that Jonathan was.That was the day I learned of Jojo's Ripple aptitude.So he inherited his grandfather's innate aptitude and talent for the Ripple.Yes.But why do you stray from the task at hand? What have you done?! I've just dispatched these men, and once I have dispatched you, Jonathan's nephew will be saddened, but he shall also bear a substantial grudge towards me.S-Straits-! Straits H-Have you gone off the deep end? No, I swim in the shallows, Speedwagon.I learned the Art of Mystics to discipline my body against the elements.But no matter the discipline I've attained all these years, my body continues to wither.I've become weak.I have ascended humanity, but not to a satisfactory degree.As the Ripple cannot halt the hands of time, I admit to having secretly yearned for all that Dio possessed, 50 years ago.His strength, his beauty, and his immortality! Long have I yearned for the blessings of the stone mask, no matter the lives of others I've sacrificed to attain them! Y-You really have gone off the deep end, Straits! With your blood, I shall acquire immortality, and the only remaining people who know of the stone mask would be both Erina and Joseph Joestar.Once I've k*lled them both, I shall dedicate my eternity to uncovering the mysteries of the stone mask that Dio could not! S-Stop, Straits We still know nothing about the stone mask's purpose Ms.Erina Jojo! Hey you! Watch where you're walking, you willy-nilly wack! Scram, you stupid schmo-schmuck-schmegeggy! Get outta the way already I beg your pardon? I'm sorry, you'll have to repeat everything you just said again.Slowly, say it again.And this time, keep your spiel in English.Stray from English, and you'll be cruising for a bruising.Jojo, what are you doing? N-Nanna Erina! What are you doing to that taxi driver? Um Well, I'm A taxi! I was catching a cab for you, Nanna Erina! My Jojo, that was very thoughtful of you.Mr.Smokey, do join us.Nanna Erina and Joseph were the last of their family, the last of the Joestar Estate.I learned a little about them in the cab Say Nanna, I know Great-Uncle Speedwagon was adamant about having us here in New York with him, but he's not even in town to greet us.The codger's probably on vacation! His work in the oil industry must be keeping him away.Say Nanna.Was Great-Uncle Speedwagon really just Grandpappy Jonathan's best mate, and nothing more? What are you suggesting? Well, that old codger's always been a bachelor, and you've never married, even after Grandpappy passed.I was simply curious as to whether or not anything ever happened between the two of you.How dare you disrespect your Great-Uncle! I'm sorry! I'll never say it again! Nanna, I'm sorry! I know Great-Uncle Speedwagon was Grandpappy's most faithful friend! Apparently, Joestar Estate heirs had always d*ed young.When Nanna Erina was young, her husband had d*ed on their honeymoon voyage.The boy she would give birth to would later wed the girl Nanna Erina saved during that unfortunate voyage, who would later gave birth to Jojo.Jojo's father lost his life to w*r, and his mother lost hers to sickness.Regardless, Nanna Erina stayed strong through those tough times.She's kindhearted to any and all, even to a rotten hood like myself.I wonder if it was all those lonesome years that made her warmth so comforting Jojo's got that same warmth.But it was that very kindhearted comfort that got us into trouble that night, all because of my color.Hey, waiter! Waiter! Yes, sir? Does your establishment cater to smelly swine? Does it?! The stench of that n*gro has ruined the very dish that I dine on! Kick that co*n out! Sir, our restaurant reserves the right to cater to any guest who decides to dine here, granted that they pay for their meal.Is that a fact?! You'll let this animal eat his own kind, will you?! I think I'd better go Jojo.Nanna, you wouldn't have me stay my hand, would you? I will not.Everybody is entitled to their own opinion.However, when that opinion besmirches the honor of a friend, I won't stand for it.Teach that boy some manners, without disturbing the other diners! Amen, Nanna.You're looking for a fight, buddy? I say, old boy! If you're looking for your knuckledusters, you won't find it in your coat pocket! It's in your rear pocket! It couldn't be Now you'll ask, "how the Hell did you know I had knuckledusters, you hooligan?!" How the Hell did you know I had knuckledusters, you hooligan?! Because the fingers on your right hand feature the bruises of knuckleduster usage, implying that you deploy them regularly for fights! Also, your dress shirt is stained with splattered blood! You worked up an appetite before dining tonight! And the very fact that the blood is on your dress shirt, and not your coat, means that you took off your coat before fighting! Therefore, one could only assume that you hid your knuckledusters in your rear pocket after fighting! You'll shout next, "what good will knowing about my knuckledusters do you, you little sh*t!" What good will knowing about my knuckledusters do you, you little sh*t?! Right in the kisser! That'll shut you up.I'll bet that hurt! It didn't.How could you mistake this for my face? Do you always throw blind punches, or are you just blind? I can read every fat, pompous pig like a book! But perhaps you were blinded to your true nature, Swine! Please, I'd like to apologize for my subordinate's behavior.Madam, you must be Erina Joestar.I was greatly indebted to our mutual friend, Mr.Speedwagon.When I was last in London, he told me a great deal about you.I'm quite relieved to meet you tonight.Hours ago, I came across unfortunate news that won't be public knowledge for a few days.Robert Edward O.Speedwagon has been m*rder*d.M-m*rder*d?! Rumor has it that his m*rder*r was a monk from Tibet.A monk from Tibet Do you mean Mr.Straits?! I don't know, but this news came from a man in Mexico who fished a few bodies out of a river, including Speedwagon's.Where and why he was m*rder*d, as well as the whereabouts of the monk, remain mysteries.I-I may know why he was m*rder*d It had to have dealt with the tale he told me ages ago About Dio and the stone mask His death must've involved one or the other Jojo, this man has mafia ties! You can't trust the Cosa Nostra! He's been paid to feed you lies! And you're entitled to your own opinion.Old boy, your Zippo's in your breast pocket.Smokey, I appreciate a mate's word of warning, but I'll have to trust his news.The Cosa Nostra's only business is making money, and greedy backstabbers like him pride themselves on the authenticity of their news! Nevertheless! Of all the filth that you could have frothed, you just had to pick the worst one to tell my nanna.How could you upset an elderly woman so?! You shameless scoundrel! Those terrible tales from 1888 have come back to haunt me Why! Fear not, Nanna Erina.I'll always be here for you.No Joseph! I fear for you! I fear that you'll share the same fate as your grandfather! There, there.If I am to perish as he had, then so be it.At the time, I was utterly at my wit's end.I had absolutely no idea about what their family had gone through.Hey, Smokey.It's chilly-chills tonight.Look at the Miriam Gates advert! What's it on? If girls wear these, will they make 'em more "bitchy?" Let's see "Boost your busts from double A's to shining C's." Lordy-lord, don't be bamboozled by this bull My You can get a pair for $1.25! Let's see now Somehow, I get the feeling that I've seen you before Well old boy, have we met before? Hey, how come you're not puffing cold clouds like I am? Also, I could've sworn I saw a pointy tooth sticking out of your mouth Say something, Straits.Be it in the streets or not, I shall silence you before your aptitude and talent peaks, Jojo! You'll silence me, will you? I knew he was loony, but "loony" doesn't do him justice! How could he open fire from an open street?! And just where in the world did he get his hands on a Tommy g*n?! I was awaiting your arrival, Straits! I know a few b*ll*ts won't be enough to slay you, but on behalf of Great-Uncle Speedwagon I'm going to w*r! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Vampires are strong, all right! I'll slash you down to size, Straits! German medicine is the greatest medicine in the world! You know nothing about him! Apologize to him in Hell! Episode The Wizard
01x11 - The Game MasterQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:48I knew he was loony, but "loony" doesn't do him justice! Straits! I could hack your head off, rip it with the Ripple, or strike it with sunlight! Pick your poison, because one of them has to hurt less than the other two! T-The crazy gunman's in the cafÃ©! Somebody, save us! He'll k*ll us all! Jojo, what were you! What have you done?! Well at a glance, it looks like I'll be working my whole life to pay back Irene's.Don't be a dope! You k*lled that man! What "man?" You mean Straits? Now what happened here? These b*ll*ts here all appear to have been bent.Smokey, make like a banana and split! In all honesty, I hope he was still a "man," because if he was, I would only end up in Alcatraz for murdering the cur.-You mean he wasn't?! Shush up, sisters! The echoes of your screams irk me ears! b*at it, before I French your face!

Vampires are vigorous! Dio's downfall stemmed from poor prioritization.He prioritized experimenting with his powers at his own leisure, rather than k*lling Jonathan, who ultimately ended his existence.But I won't allow history to repeat itself! I can experiment all I want with my powers after I've k*lled you.And I will k*ll you, with the final technique Dio used against your grandfather! Empty, are you? I'll empty your skull with my highly-pressurized blood beams, which I call "Strait's Bloody Streams!" Die, Joseph! Jojo! Arrogance was your undoing.And now, only Erina Joestar remains.k*lling her is And now, you'll say, "like taking candy from a baby." like taking candy from a baby.Next, you'll ask, "how could he still be alive with that hole in his skull?" How could he still be alive with that hole in his skull?! Well Straits, if only you would've left your isolated temple in Tibet and seen the world, you might've actually learned something new.You could've k*lled me if you'd only been more attentive.Take a good gander at the face on this clock! Nanna Erina told me about how those beams were to blame for Grandpappy's demise! It was a mirror?! A bit slow on the uptake, aren't we? Straits! I've heard that the Ripple mimics the effect of sunlight on vampires! Enjoy this! I'll zap you to bits with this jolt! Now, Ripple energy supposedly melts the visage of vampires, so let's have a look-see.Y-You're not melting! You're not even dying, are you?! I suppose Nanna Erina forgot a detail or two! Unlikely.But I was right to assume that you would become a great thr*at to my existence.I'll let you in on my secret.This muffler was hand-knit from the dried microscopic bowels of 30,000 Satypolasia beetles, a species of beetles indigenous to Southeast Asia.This material conducts and disperses Ripple energy quicker than it does the human body, effectively neutralizing the Ripple.You could consider this muffler akin to a lightning conductor.I, Straits, am the successor and Lama to the 4,000-year-old Art of Mystics.You cannot hope to defeat one who knows everything there is to know about the Ripple! That is why Dio d*ed! And what a jolly good advert that was.But what makes you think that I'd limit myself to using the Ripple against you? Unlike you, I'm quick on the uptake! When and how did you attach a grenade to my muffler?! A pathetic parlor trick! You really could learn something new from seeing the world! Take a good gander at that grenade you just pulled! Impossible! H-He's a goner now! H-How could he still Smokey, don't look at 'im! Too late! Lord have mercy! Have mercy on my soul, for I shall do no wrong from this day forward, every day! Lordy-lord, have mercy on us all! H-He's a monster H-Hey Jojo, you got anything else up your sleeves? I do, indeed.You do? Yes, and it's my backup plan.S-So, what are you gonna do then? It's a relatively simple plan.Look at his legs.They've been blown to bits, but he's slowly building 'em up again.His recovery will take time.So, what's your simple plan? We're gonna use our legs! And do what, exactly? We're gonna skedaddle on outta here, Smokey! Clear the road, rubbernecks! That wack's really wacky! Pursue me, Straits! Hold up, Jojo! Though immortal, being blasted to bits takes a toll on the body, and requires a massive amount of energy for regeneration! This'll be great for the tabloids! The more pix I have, the more money I'll make! Lucky me! I'll be a real reporter in no time! His digits can exert pressure of up to 235 kg/cm^2! He can reach a height of up to 4.22 meters! I-Is there something behind me? We should be safe from him now I doubt that, Smokey.Can't you hear it? What's to hear, besides the running of the good ol' Hudson? Not the Hudson, but him! S-Save me! He found us! We gotta run! This woman is my hostage! If you attempt to flee, I'll k*ll her! But if you can rise to the occasion, I'll release her! You're pulling me leg here! Why would I risk my arse for some broad, you bozo?! Jojo, we gotta go! I present a trial to you! If you flee and leave the woman to my mercy, then you are nothing more than a coward! No longer shall I pursue you, for that blast has left me debilitated and fatigued, but I will never acknowledge you as Speedwagon's avenger.However, should you choose to face me, then I shall acknowledge your courage! You will become a great thr*at to my very existence.But before your talent manifests, I shall exhaust every ounce of my energy into k*lling you! You have five seconds before her head flies! Make those five seconds count! If I had a sweetheart for you to take, I'd bust your bozo butt, but instead, you picked a no-name hideous homegirl for a hostage! Then you wouldn't mind if I destroy her jaw and tear out her throat, while pulling out every organ inside her body as she still breathes.I doubt proud the successor and Lama to the Art of Mystics would commit such cruelty against a woman Th-That's her wisdom tooth! Hot damn, he pulled out her wisdom tooth! You son of a bitch! You really pulled out her tooth! I shall show no mercy! Screw you Straits! You asked for it! You're nothing but a vicious vampire now! And you're an atrocious actor, but I knew you were easy to enrage.I'll slash you down to size, Straits! Die! I just figured out a way to b*at those beams! You nicked me the second time, but you won't catch me off guard the third! Rippled! Wha-! Tha-! "That's impossible," is it? That's impossible! I deflected your bloody beams with Rippled sh*t glasses, because I knew you couldn't resist blasting my brain.Your pattern's just too plain! I want you to beg for Great-Uncle Speedwagon's forgiveness in Hell! You can rest easy starting tonight, Nanna.Why did you halt my descent? For all you know, I might have the strength to take that right arm of yours off! Then do it, for chrissake! Just know that if you do, I'll bash your skull in with ol' Lefty here! Answer me this.Why would you toss Great-Uncle's corpse into the river?! It just doesn't add up to me! Joseph You really have inherited Jonathan's every trait.Unlike Jonathan, you are impulsive and easy to enrage, but you possess his penchant for adventuring and meticulous meddling! I shall sate your curiosity and reveal the events that you have now been entangled in! What "events?" They shall unfold in good time.Beginning with the Man in the Pillar! He'll be the one to change your ways! Could you be any more ambiguous, you damn bozo?! I let their bodies be carried by the river because of him.He began sucking the blood of the men I k*lled, alike a tree intaking its nutrients from the soil.This sight unsettled me which is why I discarded their bodies in the river.But I'm certain his awakening is close at hand! His awakening from two long millenia of sleep! Joseph You shall encounter him soon, and he shall be the one to change your views on man's very existence and evolution! Once you know what he is, you'll understand the machinations of our maker.I-Is that the Ripple?! You've channeled the Ripple within your very body?! I regret nothing.Brief as this was, I am content with descending into the depths of Hell in my youth, rather than wither away as an elder.Regaining my youth was the greatest ecstasy I could've ever hoped for.Wait, Straits! I'm not finished yet! Farewell, Jojo! Jojo In 1938, the world would be torn asunder with the advent of World w*r II.The ambitions of the Third Reich ran rampant throughout the w*r.They brought the most technological advancements in Chemistry, Astrology, Sorcery, Alchemy, the Paranormal, and the Occult, all into the w*r! They mastered every existing academic discipline known to man, and waged w*r against the world.Even Straits actions Mexico were no secret from the intelligence they gathered at their base in Mexico.F-Forgive my slip, Mayor Stroheim! I-I just lost control over my hand! Lick it.You cut my cheek, ja? Lick my cheek, and everything will be wunderbar.Okey! Be slow and steady with your tongue.Be gentle, FrÃ¤ulein.Be steady because I can't feel any pain now.Be careful now! It's very sharp, ja! Excuse me, SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim! The injured old man we rescued from the Rio Grande has regained consciousness! We can begin extracting information from him immediately! Hey, give me a sign.What's your name, Toots? I could give you a lift home if you need.What was that for?! You called me a "hideous homegirl," didn't you?! Well consider that punch payback, you big ham! Did I really? Indeedy-do.You were rippin' that fool for taking a no-name hideous homegirl hostage.Really? Golly gee whiz, how could I ever call a such a sexy sweetie hideous? Maybe a little pain will help you remember your words, Jagoff! You busty bitch! Now that she's not numb from fear, she's screaming in agony.And I'm concerned about that "Man in the Pillar" Straits was singing about.Make way for me, Mexico! How do you fare, Herr Speedwagon? Tell me if you've ever heard of this European aphorism before."When an elder takes his own life, his village shall soon be doomed." Perhaps the elder took an unspeakable secret with him, as you had attempted.Does that secret concern him?! We excavated the pillar from the location of those ruins that we extracted from you.O Father in Heaven! Why do I not recall the events that he speaks of?! Why didn't you leave me at Death's Door?! It was not by His hand, Herr Speedwagon.I was the one who saved you from Death's Door, and it was the m*llitary might of the Third Reich that coerced your revelation! Though you are elderly, we know that even under interrogation, you would never break your silence.You crossed the Atlantic a penniless pauper, and as you slowly starved in the deserts of Texas, you chanced upon crude oil.Now, your very foundation may alter the course of any economy in the world.But that pales in comparison to the medical advancements of the Third Reich! Our ambition shall overcome all! You used a truth serum! But what else is there to gain from me?! We need to know everything! Everything that you know! Everything that transpired in your past between Straits and the Joestars! Anything we can use to awaken the Man in the Pillar! D-Don't! You don't know what you're getting yourself into! He's a greater thr*at than that of the Third Reich! Prepare the subject's chamber for massive blood injections! This experiment must succeed! No quiero morir! LÃ­brame! I have a suggestion.Everybody must collectively determine a sacrifice.We require blood for our experiments, and if one must die, then let it be the one that you all choose.Once everyone's decided, you'll all be freed today.I-I will be your sacrifice! If I die, at least the others will be free! Very well, boy.I commend courageous boys with bravery as big as yours, ja? Only the brave may live to serve the Third Reich.Spare the boy and execute the others! Commence the experiment! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Your ignorance will cost you your life!

Y'see, 95% of a cactus is composed of water, meaning that I may manipulate any cactus's composition with the Ripple! Now cough it up, Donovan! I want to know everything you know! He's alive.I was afraid the location of Great-Uncle's body might've remained a mystery I had a feeling But now, I know he's alive.He's alive, and that's the best news I could ask for! If I could tell Nanna Erina the news now, she'd be so sunny! But no matter what the Jerries do to him, I'll be there to bail him out.And we'll be back home to see Nanna Erina's sweet smile again! S-Scheisse! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim! Fissures have begun forming across the pillar! We've already injected five adults-worth of blood! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, we still know nothing of the subject's abilities.Perhaps we should be cautious with the amount of blood we inject! Ja.But how does the Man in the Pillar absorb the blood of our prisoners? Wait, don't bother answering! Why listen when I can imagine, instead? Herr Speeeeedwagooon! What's got you shaking? Why do you seem so distressed? Your ignorance and conceit shall cost us all our lives! Listen to me.That chamber is a shelter of sorts.The iron plates lining the walls are all 50 centimeters thick.That chamber is fitted with flamethrowers, machine g*ns, and even a time-b*mb.You're in the safest zoo in the world, and you still fear the growls of caged Grizzlies! Have no fear! Although he was preserved in a pillar for eons, he is nothing more than a troglodyte in tatters to SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim! We have a leak! It's blood! The blood we've been injecting into the pillar is being purged! The blood's obstructing our observations! Cleanse the chamber with a shower! The subject has shed his stone-skin, and his body now appears smooth and supple, with a lustrous shine to it! The subject is organic! It bears similar traits to h*m* sapiens! He needs a name, ja? The "Man in the Pillar" tires the tongue.I shall do a godfather's duty and christen the child! And it shall mean "the withering winds of Mexico," Santana! Santana of Mexico! He's rising to his feet! Now, stand for me! Display your talents for our eyes to behold, Santana! Intriguing! Santana's scratching his head and it's very intriguing, ja? This is the "Omnipotent Organism?!" What's so "omnipotent" about him?! Speculate, Herr Speedwagon! He's ascertaining his surroundings through smell! He's like a confounded caveman! I'll bet he doesn't have an ounce of intelligence, ja? Oh, the hilarity.Nevertheless, we shall designate "Santana" as the creator of the Stone Mask.Sturmmann, commence the second stage of our experiment.Release the subject's stimulus from confinement.Jawohl! Wh-What in God's name is that?! A prisoner.We forced him to wear the Stone Mask.S-So he's vampire now! Until a few days ago, he was an ill, toothless elder near Death's Door.He hasn't had his fill of blood today, so he's eager to quench his thirst! He's a volatile vampire! We'll have to see how Santana reacts to this stimulus! How could he be defeated so quickly?! He's as brittle as a human being! If we lose the subject now, without any data, the experiment will have been for naught! The prisoner had an expl*sive device transplanted into his head! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim, should we detonate it?! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer! Detonate the device! S-Stopp! Don't detonate the b*mb! L-Look at what's become of his chin, his mandible! A-And look at his arms They're inside Santana! I was foolish to assume Santana's demise, since Santana was actually absorbing the prisoner's body! Santana's absorbing the prisoner's body as if he's devouring it! What sort of "Omnipotent Organism" is he?! Santana used his entire body to devour the vampire's as his breakfast! A-And now that he's eaten, the vampire's energy shall surge throughout his body! Mein Gott! He's devoured the vampire! With his body! A-And his body's grown substantially! Calm your concerns! The subject remains trapped in an impregnable shelter! Only his body mass has increased from devouring the vampire! Wh-What What of his intelligence? Does he display sapience?! S-Strohe-im! S-Strohe-im! S-Strohe-im! Impossible! He spoke?! H-He spoke my name, too! He shouldn't be able to hear a single decibel from within that chamber, either! According to Donovan the Pincushion, there's a high-security facility located 20-meters underneath that villa.Great-Uncle Speedwagon's bound to be there.But how can I get in, first? Only canned goods, eggs, ham, meats, and vegetables are permissible for carriage beyond this point! Achtung! Everybody gets a frisking! What's the matter now? Smile for me while I frisk you, FrÃ¤ulein! Smile for me and flip those skirts! You may pass! NÃ¤chste! I've brought tequila for your throats, so won't you let me pass, por favor? Hands up, now! Move, and we'll sh**t! What have I done to deserve such treatment?! He's moving, Hansel! Feuer! Don't sh**t me! I-I won't move anymore, I promise! Crikey! You Jerries really do have eagle eyes! Nobody could've seen through this disguise! You Dummkopf! Anyone could've seen through that disguise! What kind of woman could ever have as much muscle as you, Trottel?! You're a fool to think that your face could ever be as fair as a FrÃ¤ulein's! Come again?! Rippled! Â¡Caramba! You Jerry jerks My face is fair.Hopefully, things will go smoother with this disguise.Wh-What happened?! I-I don't know! You mean you weren't watching?! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim, I-I looked away for a brief moment You were there, as were the others.But none of us were looking at him Concentrate on me, not the coffee! I-It was very brief I looked away for just a few seconds.I even have a visual acuity of 1.5! But even I couldn't see what took place within! What I still can't believe is how he managed to vanish from this sealed chamber! There is no trace of physical damage to the walls, either! We just need to be collectively calm and search him out! He must've hidden himself somewhere, where we have no eyes! Cut off the oxygen supply to the chamber! He'll reappear once asphyxiation kicks in! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, we've finished developing the surveillance footage.Take it to the movie projector! Jawohl! Start the reel.He's running towards the wall! Th-Then is he?! O-Oh mein Gott! He's gone up the ventilation shaft! H-How could he possibly break his body to fit into that 4-by-20-centimeter slit?! Th-This is terrible! He didn't just break his body! He shattered every bone in his skeleton, just so he could squeeze into that slit! Th-Then that means he's hidden himself somewhere within the ventilation system of this facility! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, do you recall Santana's first words? It was your name! He must've heard it through the chamber's ventilation exhausts! Then this control center is connected to the chamber's ventilation shaft?! Sturmmann, step away from the ventilation shaft's exhaust! Jetzt! S-Santana's struck the Sturmmann! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim What's happened?! It's so dark, and I can't see a thing! Why are the lights out?! Santana snuck himself into that stormtrooper's body! Mein BrÃ¼der, where have you all gone?! Don't leave me behind! I don't know why, but I've never felt so alive until now! What have we done? If Santana escapes, he will become a thr*at to the ambition and existence of das Vaterland! He must die! Santana must be slain! sh**t him! Send off our fallen Sturmmann with a symphony of shells! He's still alive! As I feared! Machine g*ns just aren't enough to k*ll him! How can he stand?! Why's he pointing his finger at us? What's he trying to do?! W-Wait! He's mimicking the barrel of a g*n! Perhaps he's merely mimicking our actions! M-My name was the only one he's uttered so far, because that's the only one he's ever heard! There's no logic to mere mimicry! P-Perhaps he has no mental capacity for sapience! If he can only mimic our actions without any reasoning, he can be controlled! Was it you Teutonic tribesmen who dared to disturb my dreams? H-He formed a sentence! It's no "monkey see, monkey do" with him! H-He's demonstrating an advanced degree of sapience! He's already ascertained our speech of the English language! Now die.What?! H-He's absorbed and accumulated our b*ll*ts in order to fire them from his finger! Herr Oldboy, I suggest you come with me and stay hidden for a while! He'll start f*ring his fingers off in any second! Nay! I desire no assistance from men of the Third Reich! Well gee whiz Even when you're in a pickle, you're still the same stubborn codger.H-He perplexes my mind to no end! S-Stay away! Hello Jerry, I'll be needing your hair.A bundle of it, in fact.Au-aua-autsch! What are you doing to me?! Pulling out a bit of the ol' Barnet! How dare you offend the hair of an Offizier! Who are you? I-Impossible, I recognize that impulsiveness! I call this my Barnet Fair Ripple! It you! It really is you, Joseph Joestar! Barnet Barrier! Jerry, your Aryan hair's looking pretty limp! Spruce it up a bit with a splash of egg white to prevent balding, Stormtrooper.How on Earth did you find me?! Hello, Great-Uncle! Ha ir I'll tell you later, because I've gotten myself into one smelly pickle.I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time So this is what true sapience means! He's got me shaking! SeÃ±or Santana, let's sing! Enough, you pathetic caveman! He's absorbing my leg through its wound! Episode Jojo VS.The Omnipotent Organism

You listen to me, and you listen well.Santana is responsible for creating the Stone Mask, which he uses to transform humans in order to absorb their potent vampiric powers.He is a thr*at to humanity! Santana must be k*lled! Be careful, Jojo! Think fast! I caught you off guard, you chatty chap.Top o' the mornin' to ya.Nice tae meit ye! Nice tae meit ye! SeÃ±or Santana, lets speak some Scottish!

Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna Who can say, but the bonds of these braves nigirishimete will never be buried.Jojo VS.the Omnipotent Organism Episode Nice tae meit ye! Why are you trying to confuse him?! Are you trying to get yourself k*lled?! Honestly, who could really say that he's bad to the bone? I'm trying to get acquainted with him.I think that if you treated him nice from the start, he might've cooperated.Don't be so delusional! He m*rder*d all of my men! So what? You Limburger-smelling bastards deserved it! I would want you dead too, if you treated me like a guinea pig and sh*t at me! As for why I'm here, I came to bring Great-Uncle Speedwagon back to the Big Apple.I have no quarrel with SeÃ±or Santana here.So sing with me! Nice tae meit ye! Where are his manners? He just brushed me off without a single glance.I'm pretty perturbed now.Fine.I'll trip him up and make him kiss the floor in return! H-He walked through me leg?! A-And what was that feeling I just felt?! What is this "thing?" What purpose does this "thing" serve? New sentences! He's made many comprehendible sentences now, which means that he's already mastered the syntactic rules of Modern English! H-Hot damn! He's disassembling that machine g*n like a watchmaker to his watch! It requires hours of undeterred focus and attention to learn g*n disassembly, and yet H-He is demonstrating that he does possess the mental capacity to learn! Luminous Never, have I beheld such luminance Your people didn't take any lessons away from this experiment, but he took plenty from us all! Say SeÃ±or! If you can speak, then return my greetings! Anybody home? Jojo, stop that! Enough of your begging, you caveman of contempt! Holy mackerel! Ribcage Ripper! Also known as versatilis cavea thoracis! Any rib may be retracted to protrude externally outside the thoracic wall! Jojo! Scintillae? Only flint and tinder can create scintillae I could not devour this human and he was lofted away.Nor could I devour his leg, either.Never have I met so unusual a human.Is this human the only one with such talents, or are all the humans of this era the same as him? He is the only one with such talents.Jojo! He's in my head! Great-Uncle Get your stinking mitts outta my Great-Uncle! You are bad to the bone! I'm gonna bust your bad butt into a bust for The Met! Humans have evolved some, since I was last awake.Take a big bite outta my Ripple-sandwich! Th-The Ripple's making blood float off the floor?! It's not hurting him! My Ripple energy's being dispersed over his body and onto the floor, like rain running off a trench coat, causing the blood to float! His flesh works exactly like Straits's muffler because it acts like a lightning conductor! This human's energies are repelling my own M-My hand is whole! W-Well whaddya know? Curling my fist down to my wrist in a split kept my hand whole! But golly gee whiz, the Ripple's useless against him.What do I do now? You're wrong! It's not completely useless! The Ripple is acting as a barrier against him! It's preventing his body from devouring you whole! What good does that do him?! It's like eating Kugelfisch, ja? k*ll it first, and then remove all the parts with tetrodotoxin before eating! The Ripple is the tetrodotoxin to Santana, but he need only k*ll him first! What a pickle of a predicament this is! There has to be a way! At least a way outta here, so that we all survive! No, you Dummkopf!! Santana must not escape! He's a grave thr*at to all humanity! Shuddap! It was you and your Jerries who got us into this mess to begin with! And now, you expect me to save all of humanity because of your idiocy?! I'll bet I can channel the Ripple into you with this Kn*fe! His skin's like rubber, and it's stopping the Kn*fe from tearing though! But how will you manage to avoid me now?! I'll channel the Ripple straight into your sockets! This plan'll work like a charm! B-Bloody Hell! He rendered his whole head rubbery! Jump away while you still can, Jojo! Jojo! His diaphragm's been struck hard, so he'll be gasping for a while! So, the human's energies are born from his blood and breathing.However, he is a mere mortal when unconscious.Jojo! Use Ripple Respiration! Respire, goddammit! For the love of God, use Ripple Respiration! Jojo! Th-That's it! I'm gonna blow us all to kingdom come! May the Third Reich live for ein-TausendjÃ¤hr-! Stop that speech, Stroheim! Keep your pantyhose on! I was waiting for this from the get-go! If I couldn't get past his skin, then I'd get under his skin! I figured I could channel the Ripple from within him! Jojo! I was waiting for you to take the bait! Here comes the clincher! Be Rippled to shreds! I-I get it now! After seeing into his stomach, I understand how his spooky body absorbed everything he devoured! Every cell in his body secretes gastric acid for digestion, which breaks down anything his body devours! That explains why his body can devour others, and grow from absorbing those nutrients! I'm only whole because I channeled the Ripple into him before his cells began secretion! Still, your Ripple powers aren't developed enough! He survived the Ripple you channeled because it lacked potency! Trying to put yourself back together, eh? I saw how Straits did it during our duel, so I was waiting for you to do the same! Stroheim! Stay sharp, Stormtrooper! Can sunlight k*ll him?! I-It can, Herr Joestar! The murals in the ruins depicted the very effect of sunlight! Sunlight can k*ll Santana! That is why he created the Stone Mask, to withstand sunlight! Why are you showing him the way out, Herr Joestar?! We can't let him escape from here! I'm gonna let the sunlight finish the job I started! Joseph's gasping for air! He's fought well without discipline, but without Ripple Respiration training, he can't store Ripple energy for prolonged fights! This is as far as you will go, you contemptible caveman! Jojo! Respire, goddammit! I'd love to, but keeping this k*ller- diller from k*lling me is exhausting! Why did you have to be such a pisser?! Now, I'm gonna drag your arse up these stairs, and personally watch you burn to death! What the-?! I feel heavy M-My body's being weighed down! Wh-What in the bloody Hell's going on?! Brawn Bloodsuckers! Also known as sarcosanguisuga! Santana's flesh is stuck to him! Th-They're sucking my blood! Y-You trifling twit! Sunlight! You are the first human I have met with such mettle since my awakening.SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim shall unleash the sunlight! All that remains is opening this door.It's the least I can do.S-Stroheim You insolent idiots I was only centimeters away, too! Cease your struggle.Good grief! Herr Joestar! Do me a favor! What ever could it be, goddammit?! I'm trying to figure out a way outta this pickle, so shut your trap! Listen to me! Do you see those axes on that wall? Grab one, and use it to sever my leg! C-Come again?! Cut my leg off, Dummkopf! Once you do, I can reach the doorknob! W-Why the Hell would you even ask me to cr*pple you?! Be quick about it! His body will begin accumulating soon! Shuddap! I'm not a g*dd*mn surgeon, so don't even ask me again! I am an honorary SS-SturmbannfÃ¼hrer of the Third Reich! I was disposed to death the moment I accepted this assignment! I would willingly give both my legs and arms for the sake of das Vaterland! He's almost whole, Herr Joestar! I told you to shuddap! Keep nagging me, and I really will cut your g*dd*mn leg off! CUT MY LEG OFF! Blimey! I thought he was all title and no talent, but he's really willing to go all the way! My hat's off to you for your dedication to your duty, Stroheim! Timber! And now, I'm gonna enjoy watching you burn to death! Is he dead? Wh-What's he doing?! He's going up through the wound in my leg! No you don't! I-I don't believe it! He burrowed himself inside Stroheim's body, instead of mine! Santana's inside my body! Th-This monster just won't take a hint! His tenacity towards life is extraordinary! So long as he stays inside Stroheim, he'll remain immune to sunlight! W-Wunderbar Terrifically wunderbar! Would you like to know what's so wunderbar? I can't feel the crippling pain in my leg any longer! In fact, it feels absolutely euphoric! Stroheim! A-A grenade?! Y-You wouldn't! Herr Joestar! Today, you have witnessed the feats of Santana, the Omnipotent Organism! Now that he's within me, I'm as good as dead.At the very least, I know I'll be taking him with me.But before I'm blown, I need to divulge to you our intelligence.My only regret is that I'll be informing an enemy of the Third Reich! We didn't awaken Santana in the middle of a Mexican desert without good reason! Whaddya mean?! Why're you telling me now?! Listen! You have an obligation to hear what I have to say! Our researchers in the Third Reich located others like Santana in the catacombs of a certain city in Europe! I-It can't be! Speak sense and say it ain't so, Stroheim! Santana wasn't the only Man in the Pillar we found The Third Reich has sought to uncover the mysteries of an ancient species of h*m* which existed nearly 2,000 years ago, known as "Pillar Men." They will be awakened soon, and if we cannot discover any other susceptibilities aside from sunlight, humanity as we know it will be doomed! For this reason, we awakened Santana in order to collect data on his abilities and vulnerabilities! In 1888, your grandfather started the w*r against the Stone Mask, but now, it is your obligation, your fate, to end that w*r! Herr Joestar! Your Ripple powers are far too flaccid to be effective against them! Head for Rome! There is a Ripple Master in Rome! Herr Speedwagon is well-acquainted with this master! S-Santana's using my body to try and escape into that well! But the moment I explode, Santana will be exposed to sunlight! Stroheim Why?! "The might of mankind is made ever evident, as it stands stalwart in the face of fear." These were the words of the great Greek bibliographer, Plutarchus.Auf Wiedersehen.I bid you farewell, you accursed island ape! Don't do it! I still have more to ask! Goddammit, you stupid stormtrooper! Why'd you have to be so selfless?! Santana!!! Step aside! Failure to obey shall result in death, Jojo! I need to store Ripple energy through Ripple Respiration! Fly aside! I felt naught but an apathetic intent to k*ll from that clash! A-And now you'll say, "you cannot defeat me, you contemptuous caveman!" You cannot defeat me, you contemptuous caveman! It's about midday now, meaning that the sunlight from above will begin refracting off the water below! You're like an overcooked full breakfast now! The thought of a sundial should've crossed your mind before you leapt into a trap, caveman! I won't let you hit the water until you're dead! Th-The sunny-sun saved my buns and the sunlight's completely turned him into stone! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Your grandfather caused mine to die!

The subject is being exposed to ultraviolet light.Please put on this mask.Send in the snake! The snake's been absorbed! Santana still lives! Absorbing organisms within his proximity is his defense mechanism! Without exposure to UV rays, he would regain mobility.Inconceivable! How can this creature be k*lled?! What steps can be taken against an immortal organism that devours even vampires?! Do not be too concerned, Mr.Speedwagon.So long as we keep Santana exposed to our artificial UV rays, he won't regain mobility.Indeed, he won't! That's one less thing for us to worry about.With time on our side, we'll be able to complete a thorough analysis for any susceptibilities.This photograph was taken in the cavernous ruins from which Santana was excavated.Look closely.They each have horns of various shapes protruding from their skulls! If the subject at the very bottom is a depiction of Santana, who could these three be?! According to the late Major, the Third Reich has discovered these remaining three subjects in the catacombs of Rome.Those Krauts! From the positioning of the Pillar Men in this mural, it may be depicting an inherent form of social stratification.Jojo and I will follow the last lead of the late Major, and fly to Rome to meet a Ripple user.That Ripple user is the grandson of the Will A.Zeppeli Caesar Zeppeli! Say Signora, from where do you hail? Come to watch the water, have you? Would you like your picture taken with it? The pigeons of Rome are rather receptive to rubbernecks, though I can't say the same for Casanova over there! Come now, boys! I've made the introductions, so at least give each other a proper greeting! Signor Speedwagon, I'd like to make one thing clear.In 1888, upon the death of my grandfather, my father willingly devoted his life to uncovering the mysteries of the Stone Mask! In Italy, the charge of a father becomes his childrens'! I have devoted myself as he, for an honorable charge it be! But what of his charge?! Until three months ago, he hadn't a single clue of his grandfather's past! I have no respect for a man who doesn't care for his clan! Say that again! Say it, and I'll make you regret it! Caesar, you're mistaken.I was the one who kept everything about his grandfather a secret from him.Then that matter is settled.You piqued my interest when you said that he defeated both Straits and a Man in the Pillar, and so I waited in the hotel's ristorante to judge him for myself.After witnessing his Ripple powers, I was disappointed to say the least.His powers lack potency! I'm willing to bet that the Man in the Pillar tripped into the well! You-! I refuse to lend a hand to this flaccid frocio! The only reason he lacks control is because he's not formally-! The time for talk is over, Great-Uncle.I'm gonna cream this queenie here.Unlikely.Your Ripple powers aren't even potent enough to overpower this woman.In that case, I'd wager that yours couldn't curb these birds! You're irking me, Eyetie! I love irking others, but I can't stand being irked! Y-You've manipulated the lady with a Rippled Kiss?! Mi ripeto.Your powers aren't potent enough to overpower that woman.Sh-Should I intervene? No.It's a trying test, but if he cannot overcome this trial, he'll never learn.You proved my point.Because of your grandfather's incompetence, William A.Zeppeli met an unfortunate end! I refuse to keep the company of any Joestar! Caesar, that's enough! Th-That's it You can irk me all you like, but I won't let you besmirch the memory of my grandfather! I have a technique that can k*ll the Pillar Men! A breathtaking technique! The Ripple Bubble Blaster! I have concealed in my gloves and guise devices for dispensing specialized soap bubbles! Fly back to the zoo from whence you came, you filthy animal! I can't-! I'll commend you for keeping conscious, but your feeble Ripple powers won't burst my bubbles.I've noticed that your respiration is in disarray now.Asphyxiate for all I care! Now you'll say, "Signorina, I'll undo my magical Ripple now." Signorina, I'll undo my magical Ripple now.When you had her choke me, I snuck a Rippled dove down her throat.I knew you couldn't resist kissing her to undo your Rippled Kiss, Casanova! I repeat.I knew your Ripple powers couldn't curb those birds! For chrissakes What is this queenie's contention? What kind of obnoxious twat needs to prance their rear into a rocker? This eyetie irks me to no end.The mook's mocking me just because he has that unique technique.I guess I'll have to make up my own.Oh, but the required effort on my behalf doesn't warrant it.I'll show him who's King 'round here, with my card technique! What's the meaning of this, Jojo? Deal the cards straight.They are straight.Looks pretty crooked to me.You won't sneak any cheat by me! W-Well whaddya know? The cat's outta the bag.Not surprising though, since the only way you could ever b*at me is by cheating.Then would you care to explain the shiny polish of your shoe, cheater? Got a problem, wildman?! I do indeed, Eyetie! Caesar! Do tell me what we've been sitting here, waiting eight whole hours for.What are we waiting for? Our escort, of course! Hey, that's one of Third Reich's Jerries! We're clear to go.The Third Reich has the catacombs placed under heavy surveillance.He's our ride inside.He is?! Germany and Italy share an alliance, and the Third Reich's dying to make scientific sense of my Ripple powers.And the only reason they've allowed you two Englishmen entryway into the catacombs was because I practically begged them to let you see the Pillar Men.Herr Speedwagon.We require the intelligence you possess.Before they awaken, we need your help to discover any susceptibilities they may have.Say Mark, how fares your sweetheart back in Germany? F-Funny you should mention her When I return home next week, we're going to get married! You are?! Mamma mia! Congratulazioni! Y'know, I was the one who taught Mark how to find this girl through flirting, sÃ¬? Great, but could you watch where you're driving?! Get your bloody chin off of the steering wheel already! On that note, Jojo, you wouldn't happen to have a sweetheart, would you? I doubt you would.What kind of girl would want a wildman like you? You'd have better luck locating Nessie than finding yourself a sweetheart! Clam it, Casanova! You're really irking on me nerves! I need to come up with my own Ripple technique to prove my prowess! There's something amiss, ja? Wh-What's with that hole?! Keep calm! They're trapped under UV ray exposure and cannot move! Analyze the cavity, but proceed with the utmost caution! Jawohl! The sacrifice of SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim and his squad have taught us to be cautious with Pillar Men.Once we've excavated the subjects from these catacombs, we'll have them sealed in a bunker in das Vaterland.How did this cavity appear? There's not enough light to see inside.Try looking in there.I-I can hear something A horn! Th-The subject couldn't have awakened! Set the radiation output on those lights to maximal! Jawohl! I-It's blocked the UV lights with a mix of blood and bodily fluids! I pondered the state of Man's strength after two millenia of slumber but dependence upon such lackluster luminance imply declination.I-It speaks! The lucent tools of Teutons mayn't withhold the will of Wham! Our hands are joined! Whammo! Awaken, my masters! So, la Bocca della VeritÃ  leads to the catacombs containing the Pillar Men! Overwhelming is this ghastly ambiance Caesar, have you ever tried channeling Ripple energy through those monsters? The Ripple is only effective against living matter, and therefore, has very little effect against their bodies while petrified.In order for the Ripple to have any effect, they'd have to awaken.I thought you said there was heavy surveillance! Looks pretty empty around these parts! It's too quiet, I tell you! Then why don't you keep it quiet? H-He's right.The SS of the Third Reich are nowhere in sight.For certain? Hey, I think I just stepped on something! The sound of it was something quite atrocious! What in the Hell is this?! Th-These are Skins of the SS! Th-They've been exterminated! It can't be! Jerry, get your silly keister back here! Th-There's something over there! Bloody Hell! Good Heavens! Th-They're already awake! Run Mark, run! Mark!!! Mark?! Caesar save me! Mark! They didn't pay us any heed! From their lack of reaction and the way that their man just devoured this poor Jerry they disregard human life in the same manner that we do when stepping on ants! The world beyond is enshrouded in darkness, is it not? It is, Master Khars.What is the will of my masters? We shall seize the eve and seek out the Red Stone of Aja.Once we find it, we will insert it into this impression, and the Stone Mask shall be supreme.Be that as it may, Master Esidisi, human civilization has greatly evolved since we were last awake.It was rumored that the Roman Emperor, Julius Caesar, possessed the Red Stone of Aja, but neither he nor his empire may be remaining in this era.Then we must seek the current whereabouts of the Red Stone of Aja.The prized possession of the Roman Emperor mayn't go unnoticed nor unheard by his subjects, the populace.I shall seek and procure the Red Stone of Aja.All in good time.For the moment, let us ascend these depths and observe the state of human civilization.Wham! How dare you strike at your superior! Enough, Esidisi! A thousand pardons, Master Khars! You always did detest the act of having your shadow tread upon, and I had perished the thought of the conditioned consequences.Two millenia have passed since our slumber.I've wronged my master and his retribution be just! Deliver upon me the justice that is due! I wouldn't dare maim my loyal servant.Rather, I require that your conditioned reflexes remain, for my own sake.It was I who wronged you by treading upon your shadow.Forgive me, Wham.Master Khars Come, Wham.Aiens! Caesar! k*ll me! k*ll me, now! Mark! Th-The pain is returning to me! It hurts! The pain is starting to overwhelm the numbness from shock I beg of you to k*ll me, Caesar! Mark! I-I can't help him! I can't do a damn thing for the guy! I can't help but feel gut-wrenching guilt right now! C-Caesar You Grazie, Caesar Mark! Mark was a normal man A normal man who gave everything for his family, his sweetheart, and his country.He was a normal, hardworking man who was devoted to his duty He was just a normal man! Caesar! Jojo, this quarrel doesn't concern you! I will avenge him! For my own sanity, I have to avenge him! Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching Down on the land Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees The rim of the land The eagle's dancing wings create as weather Spins out of hand Go closer hold the land feel partly no more Than grains of sand We stand to lose all time a thousand answers By in our hand Next to your deeper fears we stand Surrounded by million years I'll be the roundabout The words will make you out 'n' out I'll be the roundabout The words will make you out 'n' out Next Time Be a bit more sporting, why dont'cha? I told you to proceed.He's a scumbag! The clan of Mystics Taste the God's Grain Gale! Episode The Grit of Gallantry

I really hate to admit it, but Caesar's bubbles do pack a punch! You're surrounded and trapped by my bubbles now! I'll keep the bubble barrier up until you all burst! H-He burst your bubbles Your Bubble Blaster! He didn't burst them by making contact with the braids on his circlet, either.The wind he made from waving those braids burst my bubbles! So his circlet protects him from any Ripple energy! They understand the Art of Mystics doctrines! They must've made contact with Ripple users over two-thousand years ago! Wh-What is this force that surrounds these three?! Caesar, get down now! I-I'm bleeding? Close your eyes! He didn't just create wind! He created waves of miniature whirlwind projectiles! Caesar! The Mystics survived The descendants of those meddling mystics we annihilated two millenia ago waited in these very catacombs for our awakening? One cut or two to my face shall not assuage my anger! I shall have vengeance, even if it costs me both eyes! Wh-Why do you scoff at me so?! The Mystics always spoke similar as you.In fact, every Mystic we encountered during our search for the Red Stone of Aja spoke similar as you."I will k*ll you, even if it costs my arms and eyes." "I shall have vengeance for the death of my companion!" We scoff at your simplicity.V-Vaffanculo! Let us begin our search for the Red Stone of Aja.H-Halt! Halt, you cowards! The susceptibilities of all Mystics reside in both their throat and lungs! Without respiration, your Ripple powers would be rendered useless.I speak the Wise Words of Wham to all challengers."Challenge me when you're stalwart in spirit and sound in strength." The second time you do, I will respect the strength that you've worked to obtain, and honor your dedication with decapitation.The whelp is without other Mystic companions.Then let us be off.Over here, bozos.I'm a Mystic you've overlooked.Only your eyelid's been nicked bad.Your eyeball's all right, Eyetie.That was breathtaking all right.Your technique got b*at, so have yourself a seat.I'll whack these wackos for you.Jojo! It's about time I unveil my very own incredible, indisputable, inscrutable Ripple technique.Your what?! I suppose an introduction's due.The name's Joseph Joestar, the man who busted one of your own boys into a bust.I call these my Ripple Bolas.First, I'll start by channeling Ripple energy into 'em.Oh no! Jojo, are you daft?! Why would you horse around now, of all times?! Get a clue, culo! I'm trying to avenge my friend here! So am I, Eyetie.I'm pretty tiffed about your friend's death, too.I'm fuming, in fact.But it's the arrogance of these arseholes that really takes the cake! I want you blokes to watch real carefully! Be mystified by my Ripple Bolas! I hate to admit it, but my Ripple powers do lack potency! But all I have to do is channel Ripple energy through these big bolas here! This combination makes up for my lack of potency! Ingenious, if I do say so myself! Give it a whirl! Let's leave.Disappointing.Compared to the men of yore, the present race of Man must've undergone devolution.Devolution, Master? Indeed.Jojo, are you even trying?! Tossing a pair of steel balls won't do much! Jojo might actually be making an earnest effort to duel them! But this tactic would only work on the ogres of Ogre Street! Jojo's nothing more than a sideshow attraction to the Pillar Men! He's entertaining them with his antics! Goddammit! Belittle me, will you?! Don't walk away, Wack! I'll bash you from behind! I advise against it.The lifespan of a human is short enough already.Enjoy what time you have left on this Earth.You don't say! I ate some squid ink spaghetti that looked pretty unappetizing, but it turned out to be very flavorful! Your opinion only matters after you've had a taste of my Ripple Bolas! His bolas have disappeared! I've been working on the railroad All the live-long day! Th-Those are So, do you get it yet? I'll bet you haven't.Then I suppose I'll just have to show you! How could he strike so impossible a pose?! He's swerving faster than Santana ever did! And Jojo tossed away his bolas before he could even hit him! I'll commend you for your whimsical use of weaponry.You've caught my intrigue.I shall award you one minute.One whole minute.That's all the time you'll have to duel me.Jojo! I've severed the veins in your wrist! You'll have to repair your blood vessels soon, but you need to decide how best to spend your minute, or else you will die from desanguination.The fight for your life has begun! I shall share the Wise Words of Wham once more."Time is of the essence And your essence is our timer." We shall await above, Wham.Whelp, go and retrieve your steel balls.What's that? Did I hear you right? "Retrieve my balls?" "Retrieve my bloody balls?!" Quite the contrary.My balls require no retrieval, whatsoever.I call it my Bolas Boomerang! The fight for your life will be over in a minute! Allow me to honor the absurdity of your arrogance towards mankind with a good bludgeoning! I'll channel Ripple energy into your body afterwards! Very well.Strike at me more.Know that you have the honor of being the first human to ever foul my face.An honor that I grant unto you, before your inevitable death! No human's ever mucked up your mug before?! Time to change that! Your arrogance brought upon my anger from your ignorance of poor Mark's demise! I think it's time you learned something called "humility!" Something's wrong! I don't think his arm's welling up from the pain! Wh-What'cha got going on there, Wham? You were wise to be hesitant in your advance.I've allowed for your barrage to serve as discipline, as a warning against future negligence.But the duration for discipline has now elapsed.Jojo, channel the Ripple into him already! Savor my Sacred Sandstorm! C-Cor blimey! Wham dislocates his left arm and revolves it clockwise, and also dislocates his right arm, revolving it counterclockwise! Jojo's jocular genius was jarred into jam after witnessing the incredible rotary force of Wham's giant fists! The destructive force of Wham's revolving fists created a violent vortex in between, manifesting what appeared to be a sphere of sandstorms! H-He's contorting this massive marble pillar like a wet rag being wrung! His powers are nothing short of supernatural! Jojo! Thus, is my Sacred Sandstorm.J-Jojo! S-Stay here! You need to split, Signor Speedwagon.I'll do what I can to keep him here! The blood of my brow obstructed my accuracy, but he did not escape to the posterior of the pillar without being severely wounded.He has perished.Although I needn't bother with these infants, the very fact that they witnessed my bludgeoning necessitates their deaths.Make your peace.Hallucinatus.I-Is he trying to! The audacity of him! He's trying to escape! How could he resort to playing dead?! Myself aside, how dare he leave Signor Speedwagon to this thing's mercy?! That scumbag! That wack really packs a whammy of a wallop! My respiration's a mess now, so the Ripple's of no use to me! I've only got my backup plan left I have to get away! Behold the depressing state of our gallant protagonist.He's crawling to safety while playing dead! He's even abandoned his Great-Uncle Speedwagon! Nevertheless, the grit of our gallant protagonist is not at all lost! Watch! So you did survive! You coward! Did you think that you would elude the wisdom of Wham?! I only needed to lead your wisdom astray and into this mine trolley with me.I was home free the moment I got in here! So you feigned cowardice in order to lure me into this contraption, allowing the other two to escape? You fell for another one of my schemes.Get outta here while you still can, Great-Uncle! Caesar, that includes you too! Jojo You ingenious jerk! I got them covered, but what about my own butt?! I gotta scheme up something, and fast! Good grief! His gallantry knows no end! The only way the grit of Jojo's gallantry could ever be lost is if he surrendered in the midst of battle! Jojo!!! Dammit! How could he do that when his body's so m*nled?! Jojo acted the fool, through and through, but I suppose he's dying to end this w*r as much as I am! The w*r that will only end with the death of those damn Pillar Men! You dare to quip provocations with so smug a smile, while your body remains battered so.Mighty Man You move me with your minuscule mettle! How can you maintain such mettle? Have you been taken by insanity? Or perhaps you have another scheme you would dare use against me? Would you like to know? It wouldn't involve allowing that puny stick that you snuck out from the catacombs to explode, would it? How the Hell did he know?! Or, would it involve forcing this contraption to cease, causing us both to be catapulted from it? In this manner! H-He saw through my scheme again! Your one minute of continuous blood loss shall expire soon.You are incapable of repairing your blood vessels now.You are doomed to death by desanguination.But why does your smile remain so smug, without any scheme to save you? Would you like to know why? Would you really like to know why? No, I needn't know the reason.I shall k*ll you now! Shame, because if I had a month, my Ripple powers could've become potent enough to overpower you.Overpower me? Overpower you, and in one month, to boot.Am I not the first human to have fouled your face? If I actually tried a bit, I could overpower you in no time.You know, just forget everything I said.Put me outta my misery already.I consider it a great honor to be k*lled by so seasoned a warrior.Continue our conversation.I'm so sore, I'm slurring me speech now, y'great sod.Whack me and be done with it, Wham.I demand that you continue our conversation! Jojo's still alive! Here's the thing You'll get to live with the fact that you let a filthy human bash your brow in with his balls, forever.To free yourself from that shame, you'll need to duel me again when I'm fully prepared, and k*ll me in combat.Again?! What makes you think that you're worth it, Jojo?! His pride just needs another push! He called me a coward when I made my escape! Cowardice is the bane of all proud warriors who uphold their honor in battle! He has to be a proud warrior! I have the talent, but I'm not a Master Mystic.With a month of formal training and tenacity, I could easily overpower you with my Ripple powers! Also, am I not the first human, an immature Mystic, in all of history, to have burrowed five-centimeters of steel deep into your brow?! But honestly, why take the risk? k*ll me, before my aptitude and talent peaks! You scoundrel! Wham.Master ACDC His one minute has already elapsed.Why do you not end his existence? Crikey! It's his buddy! Master ACDC, this immature Mystic has thoroughly captured my intrigue.Y-Yippee! Jojo, I shall acquiesce to your proposition.If you require one month's time of training, then you shall also have one month left to live! You won't whack me? I will not.You'll duel me again? I will.I don't think you should.If you don't k*ll me now, you're really gonna regret it.I've played on his pride! I'm safe now! I won't regret it, because I'm going to ensure that you don't escape, or renege on your word to a warrior.You always did enjoy binding them to their word, Wham.I call this the "Wedding Band of Wham." I shall bind this around the aortic arch of your heart.Wh-What are you doing to me?! In 33 days, the band will dissolve, releasing a potent poison from within.It cannot be removed through surgical means! If you make any attempt to remove it, the band shall break and release the poison! Your only salvation from certain death is to duel and defeat me within 33 days! Only then may you drink the antidote that resides in this ring! Jojo! With the Wedding Band of Wham, death will do us part.Jojo, on the 33rd night, I shall await your arrival in the Colosseum.You were foolish to believe that we'd allow an unconditional escape.I have no current quarrel with you, but take the "Engagement Ring of ACDC!" I've tacked it around your trachea! My poor heart and throat! This poison is unlike that of Wham's.You'll need the antidote in this ring.Cars, won't you bind him as well? Bind, I will not.Our time is eternal, but the time of our foes flow, leaving us without adversaries.Having an adversary will make this eternity worth living.But I empathize with your desire to torment the human.Do remember that our primary prerogative of attaining the powers of the Red Stone of Aja remains.We fly! Jojo, may your month of training bear fruit potent enough to defeat my Sacred Sandstorm! Wh-What have they done?! I got two wedding bands! It's a sick, twisted joke that they both belong to men! I'm engaged to two men, too! Don't they know that bigamy's a bloody crime, where I'm from?! g*dd*mn them! This doesn't matter, so long as Great-Uncle and Caesar are both safe.I can brood over this double-betrothal later Jojo You jerk He's fainted from massive blood loss but he pulled off the biggest bluff with pizazz and panache in the middle of battle! I'll assist in your Ripple regimen.We'll both have to improve our powers, if we hope to survive.In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky they Stand there Twenty four before my love and I'll be There Next Time I was blowing smoke up their arses when I said I'd be ready in a month!

01x16 - Lisa Lisa, Hamon CoachQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:51The wedding rings embedded around Jojo's heart and throat cannot be removed through surgical means.They will dissolve and release poison into Jojo's body in 33 days, unless he can obtain the antidotes by defeating both ACDC and Wham.Venice What the Hell have I done?! I was blowing smoke up their arses when I said I'd be ready in a month! And they bought my bluff! I should've said "one year" instead! Hey Jojo How can you even joke about this?! Help me help you and think of something already! I-I am thinking! But there's no use crying over spilt milk.We both need to keep calm in order to carry on, Caesar.For starters, you'll need to be able to perform the exact same act I'm about to show you.The water's not pouring out! Give it a try.Keep the water from pouring out.That shouldn't be too hard! Let's face some facts.In terms of our Ripple powers, we're almost equal in strength, but you always purge all of your powers out of your palms! That lack of control caused the water to explode.But I channeled my powers into my fingertips, those single points of contact.Those single concentrated points! Focus your energy into these single points, and you'll cause the water to oscillate within the glass, effectively trapping the liquid within.But increase your contact area, and your excess Ripple energy causes the water to explode.The smaller the nozzle of a liquid g*n, the further the liquid flies.Understand, Idiota?! In order for you to better control your Ripple powers, you need to undergo the formal Ripple Regimen.I've brought you to Venice for this very reason, because my Ripple Master resides here! Oh no! I hate breaking my back over work, that above all else, warrants effort! 31 Days until Marital Dissolution 31 Days until Marital Dissolution Once, four folks from the fires of Hell Shijima no soko kara awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe Shinku no chishio ga Their ambition for power assembled the blood of a few bombastic braves.tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger!

What would a Ripple Master be doing here? Gondolier.We need a ride.Take us to isola di aria serbatoio.Gondolier, did you not hear me?! H-He's standing on his bloody oar over water! Wh-Who the Hell is this guy?! Crikey! Hey, Arsehole! What in the Hell did I do to deserve a decking?! Now you're cruising for a bruising! My, at least you're capable of using Ripple energy to stand on water.A woman?! M-Maestra! This woman is known as Lisa Lisa.Her real name, personal history, family, and the motivation behind her mastery of the Art of Mystics remain a mystery.Nevertheless, Lisa Lisa will devote the next month to training Jojo and myself! You still ain't off the hook for hitting me head! I'm not gonna pull any punches, even if you are a woman! I've seen your spectacular talents for myself with this oar.You even have my compliments for managing your waddle over water.However, if you expect to become a respectable Ripple user within a month, you'll have to dispose yourself to death! Th-The water's hardened into a pair of pillars! What is this?! Joseph Joestar.For the next month, you'll have to wear that Ripple Respirator for your Ripple Regimen all day, every day.I-I can't br-! Find your respiratory rhythm.Once you have your rhythm, you'll have no issue respiring through the Ripple Respirator.But if you lose it, the respirator's valves will close, and you will suffer from suffocation.You need to be capable of running 100 kilometers while wearing that respirator! B-Bollocks! Get this bloody thing off-! I-I can't breathe! The Ripple Regimen has already begun.The only relief you'll receive is during meals and when brushing your teeth.Jojo, find your rhythm.You won't have any problems breathing once you do.Wh-Why I oughta bust you up good, you bitch! There's another important thing that need be noted.I'm not teaching you the Art of Mystics to save you from death, I'm teaching you because I need people capable of k*lling the Pillar Men! Y-You g*dd*mn, selfish You want Maestra to mess you up some more? I don't hit women! Formally, I would like to welcome you both to Venice! She's earned the title of Ripple Master, but I would never wed a mistress like her.But there's a cute quality about her Show some respect.Funny you should say that, Casanova.Why are you so respectful towards that broad? I respect the Maestra as much as I do my own mother! Don't demean her, or I will deck you.Isola di aria serbatoio is a small island located 30 minutes north of Venice.Unlike the vibrant views of Venice, this island remains shrouded thick in mystique.However, that very mystique is equally befitting of its very mysterious owner, Lisa Lisa.This island will serve as our training ground! That entire island is my very own villa.She told me to be disposed to death, but how bad could it actually be? Splendid.Both you and Joseph are safe and sound.I couldn't ask for more.Great-Uncle, don't you dare tell Nanna Erina about those rings! You blab, and I'll turn you black n' blue! I can't tell her Where would I even begin? The preliminary trial to the Ripple Regimen begins with the "Pillar of Hell!" A-Are you serious?! What's she screaming about? M-Maestra, you would damn us to so daunting a trial already?! Even I haven't attempted it before! Not the trial that has claimed the lives of many trainees! You either complete this trial, or you take a boat back to the mainland.Why don't you two fill me in on what's what, eh?! What the bloody Hell is this "Pillar of Hell?!" You'll understand after you've taken a tumble down this tower.Maestra, you wouldn't! Th-This is oil! The whole damn pillar's drenched in oil! The objective of this trial is to climb up 24 meters to the top of this tower, barehanded.The only way out is up.You must complete this trial, or you will die trying.We gotta reach the top of this slippery pillar?! 30 Days until Marital Dissolution Are you outta your mind?! A trial designed to temper and test the tenacity of Ripple users! This trial is so infamously, yet so aptly named the "Pillar of Hell!" This is trying I'm using all of my Ripple energy just to stick to this pillar.Even moving my fingers a centimeter upwards is exhausting! If I fall If I fall from this pillar even once I don't think I'd have enough stamina to try the climb again! We're dead if we stay still! We're have to climb up! Jojo! The longer you keep jumping, the sooner you'll be drained of your stamina! Climb up the pillar-! D-Dammit! I can't spare a breath, either! My Ripple Respiration went awry from just speaking! This whole trial is bollocks! You knew fully that I lacked the power and control needed to climb this prick of a pillar! That g*dd*mn broad threw our arses down here without a second thought! She just lost what respect I had left for her! I've never wanted to pay back a woman before, but I got plenty of ideas to toss around me head before I reach the top! Plenty! So, a bunch of trainees d*ed before they could make it to the top, eh? I'll bet they all d*ed from stupidity! You will honor the sanctity of the trial, and abide by the following rules! You may rely only on your Ripple energy and your bare hands to reach the top! All other methods are prohibited! Gimme a break, Lisa Lisa! I mean, Mistress! Y-You don't mean to leave me here to die, do you? This is my first day of training after all! You're just trying to see if I actually make an honest attempt, right? You'll lower a ladder later, right? There was no pity in her eyes.She really will leave me in this pit to die! Goddammit! I don't care if you're a Ripple Master! That beauty of yours ain't gonna save you from my impending wrath! 28 hours have elapsed! Caesar is at the 15 meter mark, whereas Jojo remains at the very bottom.The rings will dissolve in 28 days! 28 Days until Marital Dissolution It's been a little more than a day already, but Caesar's only made it about halfway! I really should be concerned about me own arse.Even he's desperate to save his own.Caesar's fingers are the only things keeping him stuck to the pillar, b-but it looks like they just might slip! His Ripple energy's nearly spent! Climb Caesar, climb! O-Oh no, he's slipping again! He's barely hanging on by his fingertips! Caesar! W-Wait a moment, I think I just had an epiphany! Caesar's not in any danger of slipping at all! He's not using his fingertips to prevent slippage! The smaller the nozzle of a liquid g*n, the further the liquid flies.I-I think I get it now! I've solved the riddle to controlling the Ripple! Stick! Finally, I've used the Ripple to stick to the pillar! I thought that using both hands would add more friction and support my body better! It's bizarre, but I was actually thinking backwards! If I concentrate my Ripple energy into each of my fingers, adhesion to the points of contact increases! How did I not realize this sooner?! But now that I know, I'm gonna climb this pillar here, and pay back that busty bitch in full! Jojo's finally found his rhythm! Since then, 24 more hours have elapsed! Caesar is situated at the 18 meter mark, with Jojo behind him at the 16 meter mark! 27 Days until Marital Dissolution The rings will dissolve in 27 days! I know why Caesar's been taking his sweet time to climb beyond the 18 meter mark! Past the middle mark, this whacky pillar warps upward! Every movement needs to be carefully calculated beyond here! The warped curvature of this pillar reminds me of its twisted owner! Three more hours have elapsed! Caesar has reached the 19 meter mark, with Jojo only a meter behind him! Well, what do we have here? I-I-It's a fissure! With just a smidge of space for my fingers to fit! Boy oh boy, I can have a breather! Whoopie! F-Finally! I'm chuffed to bits for a breath! Wh-What was that?! Did I press something?! Wh-What's going on?! Could this be You may rely only on your Ripple energy and your bare hands to reach the top! Stay sharp! Something's gonna sh**t out! That smidge of space was a booby trap! We're barely sticking to this pillar as it is b-but how are we supposed to get past this now?! At the 20 meter mark of the 24-meter-tall pillar, an umbrella of oil spews forth! The razor-sharp nature of this ultrahigh-pressure oil barrier makes it impossible to pass! Wh-What's the matter, Caesar? A-Are you angry with me?! S-Sorry about the cock up, Caesar.But who could've resisted reaching out for a chance to rest?! I'll bet the architect was one twisted twat for putting that trap! Played me like a fool! Jojo was compelled to reach for that fissure due to a lack of confidence But am I confident enough in my own powers, that I can overcome this trap?! Only one way to find out! Wh-What the-?! He's standing perpendicular to the pillar! Caesar! Observe my Ripples of Adhesion and Repulsion! I'm channeling adhesive Ripple energy into my feet, while channeling repulsive Ripple energy throughout my body for protection from the barrier! I can coordinate, control, and simultaneously channel opposing Ripple energies! I made it! But controlling opposing Ripple energies will be an impossible feat for Jojo to replicate! He won't break through the barrier! H-Hot damn! I'm glad Caesar made it through! But I'm not even sure if I could rival his refined technique! After nine more grueling hours Caesar Passes Trial in 61 Hours Caesar has finally reached the top of the pillar in 61 hours.M-Maestra! Jojo won't be able to hold on any longer! Please halt the oil barrier's flow! He's impulsive by nature, and when he's at his wit's end, he'll be driven by impulse to penetrate the oil barrier! A-And if he does Sticking to this one spot ain't gonna stop that oil from spewing! If he attempts to penetrate it he'll be bisected from being blasted by ultrahigh-pressurized oil! And even if he manages to repel the barrier's wave, he'll fall to the bottom and die! Maestra! That's it! It's all or nothing now! Time to fly! Don't do it, Jojo! Stay where you are! I got the rhythm of the b*at, and the Ripple in my feet! Jojo!!! Wait a minute He's using Ripple energy to repel the barrier's trough to ride the wave! The further the wave pushes me out, the weaker its pressure becomes! Time to jump! He used the remaining momentum of the barrier's wave to reach that wall! He didn't fall, and he even gained three meters from that jump! None have ever attempted to overcome the trial by riding the wave.He's rather clever for using the trap to compensate for his lack of control and technique.I-I made it! But g*dd*mn! Since this wall is located above the warped pillar's 20 meter mark, I doubt anyone ever made it here! My exhaustion's wearing on me I had less than an arms-length left, too! M-My rhythm's gone and my respiration's a mess! C-Caesar! Don't get the wrong idea! I wasn't angry at you for triggering that trap! Maestra, please forgive me for lending him a hand! Lend away, Caesar but aren't you as equally exhausted as he? I completely forgot! Caesar, I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart! Don't let me go! After ten seconds and 13 consecutive pleas for Caesar's assistance, Jojo reached the top of the pillar.Jojo Passes Trial in 61 Hours and 9 Minutes Hold your horses, Mistress Lisa Lisa.When I was stuck to that damn pillar, I thought up a few decent ways to pay you back.But I've narrowed it down to two! Should I strip your clothes off, or should I pinch your nose until you cry?! I thought he was simpleton, but I suppose even he can bear a significant grudge.Pick your poison! I-I did it! I can control and keep the water from spilling out of this glass! Magnifico! After these three trying days, he's finally got the gist of controlling the Ripple! His talent is impressive, but even more impressive is the Maestra's ability draw out that talent! Mistress! I-I'm chuffed to bits! I-I'd like to start the next trial, please! I'll overcome anything you throw at me! You're hard to figure.Maybe you are just a simpleton.Fret not, for I have plenty of things to throw at you.I guarantee that you'll be chuffed to death.Ma'am! Prepare yourself, because the learning curve increases over the next three weeks.What are you blokes sneaking up behind me for?! Wh-Who are they?! The water's been gelatinized! Loggins and Messina are both my servants, but they'll be your drill instructors.E-Even I can't gelatinize water! Would you like to learn how? Would you like to perform this technique as I? O-Of course! I'm obligated to learn your techniques! Obligated? Then you're also obligated to have a closer look.Why don't you two boys introduce yourselves? It'll be especially helpful to know the names of the boy's we'll be drilling the next three weeks.Respiration! Temper your respiration, and your body, strength, and power will naturally follow.You need to respire at least ten times within the span of a second! I-I'm dying here! I want you to inhale for ten minutes, and exhale for ten minutes, in that order! You get to remove the respirator afterwards! Wh-What have I gotten myself into?! 7 Days until Marital Dissolution The rings will dissolve in seven days! Next Time I have one final trial for you both.Our strength remains insufficient.He's got a heart of gold.This is batty! Bizarre, even! How could you?! Episode Entrapment Ahoy!
01x17 - The Deeper PlanQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:52Entrapment Ahoy Episode 17 The spines of the Stone Mask may pierce through the skulls of men, but it lacks the strength to even penetrate our eternal flesh.It necessitates a greater source of strength.That's toasty This is the Red Stone of Aja, the rarest and most beautiful of all gemstones of the natural world.Light entering this gemstone will be refracted over one-billion times within, which amplifies the intensity of light, allowing a single concentrated beam to exit through its angle of entry.A prodigious power of the natural world.But it lacks potency! The strength of this imperfect cut cannot empower the spines to pierce our skulls! Only the perfect cut, the Ultimate Aja, may be embedded into the Stone Mask, granting the spines sufficient strength! And once we adorn the True Stone Mask, we will overcome the Sun, we shall reach the final stage of our evolution as True Omnipotent Organisms! The creator of the Stone Mask was fabled to be Cars, the most intelligent of all Pillar Men.Long ago, he crossed the Atlantic together with ACDC and Wham, in search of the Ultimate Aja.Suzie Q.Here is your gem, Mistress Lisa Lisa.Good girl.This is the perfect cut, the marvel of the natural world, the Ultimate Aja.So you had that stupid ruby the whole time?! The Mystics of two millenia past were eradicated by the Pillar Men, but successfully concealed this gem from them.I shall continue their cause, and conceal this stone as they had.Caesar, I know what you're going through.The terrors and tragedies our grandfathers and others faced because of the Stone Mask All because of Cars's accursed creation! Smash it! Smash that stone to smithereens! It's about time we torment them by breaking their precious jewel! That, I cannot do.Why not?! It is said that "without the Ultimate Aja, they cannot be defeated." You're yankin' me leg here! I wish I were.Nevertheless, I will defend this gemstone to the death.Jojo, Caesar I have one final trial for you both.A-A final trial?! Caesar will be paired with Messina, and Jojo to Loggins.Duel and defeat them.Entrapment Ahoy! Episode Are you ready, Caesar? Ready and willing! Dawn will be breaking soon and the darkest hour is always before the dawn.But where, oh where, could dear Loggins be? You're a real force to be reckoned with, but I'm ready to pay you back for those three rotten weeks! Is that Loggins? I-I don't believe it! I-I can't believe it! Loggins is d-dead?! A-ACDC?! The only reason you'd ever be on this isle is if you knew It was the next isle over.She who bears of the Ultimate Aja resides on the main isle.His lungs have been pulverized.One of two susceptibilities all Ripple users share.And all it took was a single lunge to his lungs Here lies the body of Drill Instructor Loggins.For the past three weeks, this twat tormented my entirety through the Ripple Regimen.I wanted so badly to pay you back for my suffering but now, you can just watch from above as I avenge you with your teachings! Hold it, ACDC.I had six days remaining, but I've had a change of heart.I'm gonna rob you of your nose ring now! Make way.I have no time to waste on you.Bollocks! You've got plenty of time to waste! Sharp sight.Your gaze could cut through me, even.But the last time I encountered one with oculars as sharp as yours, he met a dull end.I'll spare you one last breath.Make way! Make contact with me, and I'll bite off more than you ever wanted chewed! Make me! My Make me make way! I only ever make way for me morning bowel movement! He's managed to penetrate my flesh with perpetual Ripple energy And it only took him three weeks to learn some control Unfortunate.Your small growth spurt in the Art of Mystics surprised me.However, you were never going to be ready to face me! I grew tired of devouring multitudes of you arrogant Mystics two millenia ago! I will rend your arm asunder! Once I do, you will never channel another Ripple through it! Bend! Didn't see it before, did you? I wrapped a thread of silk around your arm! I had it soaked in canola oil to increase Ripple conductivity! I wish I could've strung you up by your neck, but beggars can't be choosers! Where did this thread come from?! F-From the corpse! I admit, it's a despicable scheme cooked up in poor taste, but I consider it a joint effort between Loggins and I, ACDC! 2,500 years ago, there was a m*llitary treatise in China, known as The Art of w*r.One proverb proceeds "Every battle is won before it is ever fought." Meaning, that victory is assured to the side whose schemes go unnoticed before the battle is ever fought! I was a tried truant when it came to school, but Nanna Erina taught me tons about history, so I consider it my forte.You've lived longer than me, but that doesn't mean you've learned to scheme like me! Twirl! C-Curse you! What, are you angry? Angry that you allowed your amputated arm to evaporate? Well that's just too bad! I'm more ticked than you are! Because of your bloody ring, I haven't had a good night's sleep these past three weeks! How could you?! My precious arm has perished! What's wrong with him?! H-He's bawling! I thought he'd be pissed from the pulsing pain, but this arsehole's just full of surprises! I-It's pretty disturbing to watch him wail about like a baby! My poor arm! H-He's giving me the creeps, more than anything else! I'd better lop his head off now! That was a good weeping.You see, I have an unhinged disposition.Whenever my anger peaks its threshold, only crying will soothe the agitation.So you are familiar with The Art of w*r As am I.Long ago, I crossed over into the realm of Sinae."w*r is the art of deception." "All warfare is based on deception." "If your foe is of a choleric disposition, anger them, and expose his every weakness." Your attempt to exploit my anger is admirable, but I cannot be angered.Nevertheless, Jojo, your growth has left me awe-stricken.Your control over the Ripple has earned my admiration.Long have I been without a worthy foe to fell.H-How could you desecrate his corpse?! It's slightly slim, but with time, it shall reform into my own arm.H-He's hard to figure! His anger, actions, and emotions are all haphazard! Unnerved by my actions? Has my cruelty left you concerned? I-I don't know! I've been able to act upon the emotions and slips of every enemy I've faced, but I just can't put a finger on this twat's thoughts! It's like he's reading my mind, instead! Loggins's corpse is B-Blazing! H-His corpse has spontaneously combusted! But how?! When animals expend energy for any task, their endothermic temperature rises to an extent, but I can raise the endothermic temperature of my own blood to 500ÂÂ°C.And when I severed this arm, I injected my blood into that body, which caused it to combust.Wham is known as "Whirlwind Wham" for his mastery of wind, but I am known as "Infernal ACDC" for my mastery of flame! When you induced his corpse to spontaneously combust on contact, I'll admit you had me concerned, but the fact that you deliberately did that to unnerve me is as plain as day! Clobber him, my Ripple Bolas! My Ripple powers have increased since our last encounter! You are concerned.Concerned for your safety and driven by desperation, you att*cked with so tactless a tool, Jojo.I'll s*ab your skull with my tendrils and turn your face into a fiery mess.Feast upon the Hellfire Tendrils of the Infernal ACDC! Jojo Here I come, Caesar! Bubble Barrier! That's enough, Caesar! We carry this on any longer, and we both will die.I hate to admit it, but I've lost this duel.I've been training here ten years longer than you have, but your Ripple barrier bereaved my forearm of its fuzz.Prolonging our duel would only serve to further my humiliation.Caesar, you've passed the final trial with flying colors.You'd observe the trial of that bumbling Brit, rather than celebrate your victory? My Ripple powers only developed to this extent because I wanted to overcome Jojo's own.From the day we survived our encounter with the Pillar Men, we were bound to each other.He may be prone to make reckless provocations, but he's got a heart of gold.You have little finesse with making any male friends, yet your attraction to him is alike a lass's.Th-That's ACDC! He's avoided my injections through flight I-It's a good thing this respirator blocked his tendrils Cor blimey, that burns! His blood's blazing hot! Arsehole! I haven't even breathed a real breath of air, and you've already seared my sexy lips! Me skin's singed, you shitter! Jojo Your provocation is nothing more than a diversion to allow you some seconds for scheming, no? Your face speaks the truth.My assumption is correct, is it not, Jojo?! With my next plan of att*ck I-I should stick with the Thread Shredder.While avoiding his onslaught, I'll bob and weave around a section of spikes and loop a thread around them.They'll have to stay inconspicuous and when he steps into this section, I'll trap him in the thread and finish him with the Ripple! D-Does he really have to snicker? C-Could he have already seen through my scheme?! No! There's no way he could know! Feast your eyes on my Hellfire Wheel! You will not escape the inferno of my Hellfire Tendrils for long! Finally, you've taken notice.Wouldn't you like to know why my cap's shrunk so? It's because you've entered my Thread Shredder! This cap is 100% made of wool, meaning it's highly conductive to Ripple energy.Wh-What's with the smirk?! Y-You won't be smirking for long! Your next phrase will be, "It's about time I wipe that stupid smirk off your face!" It's about time I wipe that stupid smirk off your face! H-He's got my gibe down! What shredder might you be speaking of, save for my own?! I've already seen through your shabby scheme! Jojo, do you recall your citation? "Every battle is won before it is ever fought." I'll have to agree with your every word! Down to the very last syllable! However, it was my Tendril Tactics that bested your Thread Shredder! I will now proceed to pierce your body with my tendrils, and inject my blazing-hot blood into every bit of your body! Your body will burn beautifully, and your flesh will flow alike the wax of a lit candle! Jojo's in trouble! H-He won't make it! Caesar! From what we can see, I could only surmise that Loggins has been k*lled.If Jojo is defeated, we will have to intercept ACDC afterwards.Reaching that isle will take too much time, and even then, it'll be too late.As heartless as this sounds, we must prioritize the defense of the Mistress and the Ultimate Aja! Now, we will make preparations for his interception! Jojo Jojo! As I sear your skin, sing for me a sorrowful symphony of your screams! As you stand entrapped by my tendrils, you still dare to snicker?! Has the fear of your impending death driven you insane?! Listen.I snicker at your stupidity because you haven't realized your defeat yet.Your defeat, which stems from that awfully long slumber of yours.Defeat?! What defeat?! Wait, you didn't know? I thought you could see through all my schemes.If you did, you'd understand the cause of your downfall.You only thought you had me with your Tendril Tactics, but you were deluding yourself! Give mankind two millenia, and we'll make progress in small steps.This'll sound trivial to you, but between the 18th and 19th Century, the heyday of illusionists and magicians came when stage magic became a form of entertainment.And I just happen to love the magic of illusions! I-I severed that thread H-How could it still be whole?! Behold the magic of the Restored Rope! I snuck another thread in secret, in case the original was severed, keeping the Thread Shredder solid! Even if the red thread is severed at will keep it whole.these points, the hidden white thread The oldest trick in the book! And now you'll say, "Before you channel any wretched Ripple energy, my tendrils will drill you full of holes!" Before you channel any wretched Ripple energy, my tendrils will drill you full of holes! Be ripped by the Ripple, and shred by my thread! How could I be humiliated so, by a mere man?! I am one of the Omnipotent Organisms! I can't be k*lled by this cur! I will have your head for exposing my own! Face my flames! I-I can see some sort of energy being released from his body! It must be the lifeforce he's accumulated over so many millenia! Begone! And may the lifeforce you've stolen from the multitudes of men be purged from your combusting body! Loggins I owe you a word of gratitude for your teachings.Grazie, Loggins! Santana survived our duel and remains paralyzed in stone but ACDC's body combusted and left not a trace.They should've made it one way, or the other.Maybe it's because my Ripple powers have amplified since then.To the victor goes the well-earned spoils of a small antidote.Why does this antidote look so much like snot? It had been on his bloody nose for God-knows-how-long Oh well, bottoms up.The antidote has done its duty.I just can't feel that ring around my trachea anymore.I should catch up with Lisa Lisa and Caesar on the main isle.I used a lot more brain than I did brawn against ACDC Maybe that's why my shoulder's so stiff.Six Days until Marital Dissolution of The Heart Six Days until Marital Dissolution of The Heart I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time I think white will do just fine.Hold it until after we've passed the border.But I think this pattern has its own merits.I'll k*ll them! I'm at a loss! Goddammit, I can't hit her! Episode The Stroheim Squad Strikes Back
01x18 - Commander Stroheim's RevengeQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:53I used a lot more brain than I did brawn against ACDC Maybe that's why my shoulder's so stiff.It's wearing on me Episode The Stroheim Squad Strikes Back Dawn has broken Both Caesar and Jojo should be returning anytime now Mistress Lisa Lisa.Which blusa would you care to wear this morning? Suzie Q, you're such a dear.I think white's quite clean, but maybe you're feeling a little flashy today.Be a dear and choose one for me.Well, let's see I think white will do just fine, but I think this pattern has its own merits as well.I wonder if any issues arose during their trials I've been unusually on edge all night because of this broken wine glass.I think the pristine white will do the trick.Suzie Q.Yes? When Caesar and Jojo return, tell them to come to my chambers.It'll be my pleasure.But I really do love the pizazz of this pattern.Which should I pick? I'm at a loss! White! Wait a minute! It has to have pizazz! This is a real toughie! Let's have a go at the pizazz, Suzie Q.Pizazz it is! The blusa and towel are both on the table.I'll deal with the broken wine glass, so please leave it as is.Very well.Say, Suzie Q What'cha screaming for?! Shush up and stop shrieking already! Wh-Who are you?! I don't know you! Y-You're an intruder, aren't you?! What intruder? It's me, you silly lass.Joseph Joestar.Jojo?! Shut up! I didn't recognize you without your respirator! Seriously! I can't blame you.I've only been wearing it for the past three weeks! So what's the verdict? Molto bello, si? Your lips look weird.Sure it looks weird now, but if you make me your man, these lips will be doing you a lot of loving.Love you? No way! What's wrong? Oh, it was nothing.Just my imagination.And also, the Mistress would like to see you in her chambers, but she's bathing at the moment, so do wait for at least a half hour.I was on my way up anyway, but sure.I needed tell her that the Ultimate Aja's been bubbled.There are bubbles in the Mistress's gemstone? A-Actually, forget it.It's not anything that a non-Ripple user needs to know.O-Okay Oh, and Jojo? Toots? I find your face to be quite chiseled.That's odd.My shoulders aren't so strained and stiff anymore.6:00 AM - ACDC's Ring is Neutralized Six Days Remain until Marital Dissolution from Wham I wanted to tell Lisa Lisa about ACDC ASAP, but Suzie Q told me to hold off for 30 minutes, because she's bathing.Oh, I'll hold off my findings all right In fact, I'll hold them for next 30 minutes while waiting in front of her door, but would peeping through this keyhole here perhaps be too criminal? Bitchy! Suzie Q? She's inside already? When did she get in? Kinda quick I thought I saw her at the dock moments ago What's this? The doorknob's dripping with this mysterious mucosal matter.Say, Suzie Q have both Caesar and Jojo returned yet? Suzie Q? S-Suzie Q! My gemstone was on the table, but where is it now?! Who are you?! Where is the Ultimate Aja?! Wh-What's going on S-Something's possessing Suzie Q's body! You've rendered me into but a brain, but nevertheless, I will challenge you curs to one last duel! I sent a package containing the Ultimate Aja on a mailboat moments ago, but I will not allow you to pursue it! I will hold you here and keep you from pursuing it! This woman that I've possessed still has plenty of life in her, but you cannot free her from my control without k*lling us both! But can you fools find the courage to k*ll her? ACDC! Jojo! The tenacity of these things never cease to astound Jojo! You sure took your sweet time getting here, Caesar.Y-You're okay So you survived your encounter with ACDC? You're one lucky son of a g*n Jojo! What did you do to the Maestra?! Nothing, you nincompoop! It's not her I'm concerned about, but Suzie Q! Suzie Q? What's wrong with her? She's being possessed ACDC possessed her, a harmless non-Ripple user, with his bloody brain and tendrils! Salvami, Caesar Save me They're both bullying me right now, but you won't, will you? Remember, that's not really Suzie Q speaking, but ACDC who's using her voice.Caesar, the Ultimate Aja has been shipped via mailboat already! Leave ACDC to us, and go recover the Ultimate Aja from that boat.If that package ever leaves these Venetian shores via train, it could go international, making it almost impossible to track! You're not going anywhere! If you want to leave, you cazzi will have to go through this woman! A masculine tone He must be using his tendrils to control every part of her body! Come to me! Do it! k*ll me with the Ripple! Your combined Ripple powers can easily split me in two! However, I'm certain that this poor girl's heart won't be able to withstand that power! Can you really bring yourselves to k*ll her? If you coglioni can, then do the deed and be done with it already! Enough! You'd better think again, ACDC! I could k*ll her without any qualms if it meant saving the lives of millions.I'd just consider her casualty to be collateral damage.D-Don't joke around, Jojo! Ashes to ashes, ACDC! You wouldn't! Jojo! I'm really gonna bash your brain into hers! Goddammit, I can't do it! You arsehole! I thought you'd have enough sense to skedaddle on outta her body, but you didn't even budge! Enough of your pathetic provocations.You don't have the balls to k*ll her.By now, the mailboat has already reached the mainland of Venice.You're too late now! But fret not! Wh-What is he doing to her body? E-Enough, ACDC! I'm going to cause this woman's body to spontaneously combust, creating an acidic rain of my boiling blood to come showering down! I-It's his boiling blood! H-He's destroying Suzie Q's body from within! If he continues this rain, Suzie Q will die and we'll all sustain severe scalds! I-It pains me, but Jojo, you must channel the Ripple into her body! Goddammit Don't make me do it! I'm already living with the guilt of lopping off Major Stroheim's leg! Something There's gotta be something we can do to save her! Th-Then I'll do it.No Maestra! I-I'll do it! H-Hold it Caesar! I have an idea! Remember what you did to bypass that oil barrier?! L-Let's give that a whirl! It's better than k*lling Suzie Q outright! We gotta oppose each other to overpower him, understand? Oppose? I-I do understand.Y-You might be on to something.Catch my drift? Boys, do it now! Understood, Maestra.Jojo, I need you to match my respiration.Andiamo! Jojo is channeling the Ripple of Positive Repulsion throughout Suzie Q's body, whereas Caesar is channeling the Ripple of Negative Adhesion only into her heart! Positive A Equili- brium The negative force of adhesion stabilizes the heart, while the positive force repulses ACDC! Negative Ripple Energy Positive Positive Ripple Energy Positive Negative Ripple Energy Positive Ripple Energy Positive Positive Negative Ripple Energy Positive Ripple Energy Positive Positive Negative Ripple Energy Positive Positive Ripple Energy Positive Couldn't withstand the repulsion, could he? Jojo! Just let him be, Caesar.The sunlight will negate his existence.He made me sick to my stomach! Only the most cowardly of creatures would use a woman as their cover! I'd call that courageous, Caesar.I'm almost certain of it now, after dueling him.He would've done anything he could to attain the Ultimate Aja, for the sake of his brethren.I don't know how many thousands of years he had lived, but I do know that he spent his whole life devoted to finding that single stone.He stooped to doing some despicable deeds, but I respect his devotion, if nothing else.Jojo Suzie Q.While you were possessed by ACDC, a part of your consciousness was not entirely subdued, so answer me.Where did he send the Ultimate Aja? St.Moritz Switzerland A small parcel It was stamped with the Mistress's personal seal The address on the paper was Switzerland?! So Cars and Wham are in Switzerland?! Yes, and I confirmed that the freight train bound for Switzerland departed the station ten minutes ago.So the Ultimate Aja is aboard that train, France Italy Venice Germany St.Moritz Switzerland meaning that we have to b*at that train to St.Moritz first! We'll have to resort to some despicable deeds of our own, in order to keep the Ultimate Aja from their grasps.Our conduct may be considered criminal, and another one of us may be sacrificed in the process.And it ain't gonna be me.After undergoing the Ripple Regimen, I have the utmost confidence in my own skills.I'll m*rder those mooks.Caesar! Arrivederci it is! Say Suzie Q, swerve around for a second! So long, Suzie Q! Someday, I'm gonna come back to Venice, y'hear? You will? Sure! But until then, you'd better get some good R&R! See ya! Jojo, you'd better come back to visit me! Alrl ight already! But who knows, I might just come back when you're an old nan! You're a jerk, Joestar! I'll be back soon, Toots.St.Moritz, Switzerland Drive better, Dummkopf! What's wrong with your arms? Mein Gott! The steering wheel's slashed! ACDC hasn't called in yet He went to ascertain the whereabouts of the Ultimate Aja in Venice but something must have happened to him.Jojo.Jojo! Wake up, Jojo! 5:00 PM - Six Days Remain until Marital Dissolution from Wham Wh-What is it? We've finally caught up to the train! They're busy declaring their cargo at the station.Beyond this border, the drive to St.Moritz takes less than an hour.We're lucky that we caught them here.We need you awake, Jojo.Listen, I'm trying to conserve my stamina here.Stamina's vital, okay? If you want action, then we'd better jump that train and take the parcel now.Then, I can start concentrating on my inevitable duel with Wham.We jump the train after it crosses the border.What in the blazes Pipe down, you prick! If you need to pass us, then pass us already! They're Jerries! What are they doing here on the Swiss-Italian border?! You sound quite spirited, and your growth matches that very spirit, Herr Joestar.Wh-What was that?! What did you say?! H-Hold it! Who the Hell're you?! I don't know any of you Third Reich Jerries! Look around the train! It's surrounded by the SS! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, we have the parcel! That parcel has my seal stamped on it! Then inside that package is The Ultimate Aja! Why would the SS know about the Ultimate Aja?! The Third Reich will require this Red Stone of Aja for experimental purposes.You see, you've been under our surveillance ever since your arrival in Venice.No, ever since the extermination of the SS stationed in Rome.We know about the Ripple Regimen, your encounter with ACDC, and your pursuit of this very stone.We are stationed at a lodge nearby.Accompany us there.We have much to learn from you about the Ultimate Aja, and the two who remain.Help us help you, as we are well-acquainted, are we not, Jojo? Hey, Arsehole! I ain't acquainted with no Jerry! Don't you dare be using my nickname now! I didn't expect the Third Reich to show up.M-Maestra! We have to follow them.As long as it's out of Cars's hands, it's in good hands.Italy Austria The Third Reich began Hungary Germany France England Vienne Romania Switzerland Paris Berlin Prague Czechoslovakia Warsaw Poland its occupation of several European territories circa 1938, 1938.3.13 Annexation of Austria 1939.3.15 Occupation of Bohemia and Moravia driven by the niggling fear of losing their influence 1939.9.28 Joint German-Soviet Partition of Poland Determined and political standing in the world.But after learning of the purported power of the True Stone Mask, that fear was put to rest.The Third Reich's ambition for global domination would surely be assured through the eternal powers granted by the True Stone Mask.Same Day Five Hours Later 10:00 PM I've discerned each and every intrinsic temperature within this room.A fire is lit in the hearth.There are four light sources on the walls, two on the ceiling, and two, no, three on a desk.There are four humans standing proximate to this wall.From the right, their statures read: 178 cm, 174 cm, 181 cm, and 178 cm, with one human near the hearth, measuring 183 cm.Five males en masse! One, two four, and five.You must be Cars.Swift was your journey to Venice, only to learn of your fellow's demise.And swift was your return to St.Moritz, upon learning of our procurement of the Ultimate Aja.So swift to steal it, are you? So swift, that you necessitated an ingenious method of silencing my men, without so much as a single moan from them.I sensed only five men within this room but why couldn't I sense your temperature as well?! Say, Jerries! Where's our polenta?! We're starving up here! Cars?! His hand is metallic?! You're Stroheim?! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Show no mercy!

"Bizarre" can't even begin to describe the strangeness of this scene! Cars and Stroheim, who was blasted to smithereens back in Mexico, are standing before my very eyes! Shijima no soko kara Once, four folks arose from the fires of Hell and awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe Their ambition for power assembled Shinku no chishio ga tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru the blood of a few bombastic braves.Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger! Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite Yaiba surinuke yatsura no suki wo tsuke He would exploit the flaws of the foes he faced! Tsuranuita omoi ga mirai wo hiraku And his memory would live on for all posterity! He's like a bloody storm! Atsuku like a bloody stone Red-hot like a bloody stone, ketsumyaku ni kizamareta innen ni but would he be ever free of the cursed fate of his family? Who can say, but the bonds of these braves Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna will never be buried.nigirishimete Episode 19 Climbing the Cliff of Calamity Cars and Stroheim! He's got a metallic hand and a strange steel sash wrapped over his socket.I knew the Jerries made some mad machinery from their advancements in Medicine and Science with the sole intention to be used in w*r! It's that very machinery that saved you, isn't it, Stroheim?! Jojo, I've returned from the very depths of Hell.I-I suppose I'm scot-free from guilt As a fellow human, I don't despise the guy or nothing, but he can be an arsehole because of his SS affiliations.His oh-so-high pride especially makes him a real pompous prick, but I'm sorta I'm glad to see him back.Sit on that sofa there and observe my battle, ja? H-He's giving me a nasty glare! He knows that I was the one who axed ACDC! I can feel his fury from here! Too bad! S-Stare me down all you want! I'll stare straight back at you, Cars! After I secure the Ultimate Aja from this soldier, I shall dismember you.Wham may be dying to duel you from his Greco-post, but I cannot allow the Ripple user who shredded ACDC to live any longer! Do you speak with the will of a warrior, or does the burning cry for vengeance speak for you, Cars?! Cars, pay attention! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim will be the last man you ever face! A metal man is no menace to me! Think again.He disjointed his arm to go completely around his head! His left arm must be prosthetic as well! Observe! Blimey! His digits can exert pressure of exactly 1950kg/cmÂ².Almost twice the pressure Santana could ever output! A BlÃdel you be! None can squander the scientific advancements of the Third Reich! We analyzed the data we acquired from Santana and infused these prosthetic arms with strength that overpowers his own! Therefore, Cars! If I use these arms to pluck away your flesh to a certain extent, it's been hypothesized that your bodily functions would cease to function! Alike the feathers being plucked from a bird, I shall tear your body into pieces that are each a centimeter in diameter! Herr Jojo! Yow! Do not pity me for what I have become For I am now the greatest magnum opus of the Third Reich, sculpted and crafted into a masterpiece! I have transcended all of humanity! Catch this, Cars! This Maschinengewehr has an average rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute, and is capable of penetrating through 30-mm-thick metal plating! This HMG will be the ticket to tearing your body to pieces! What part of him isn't machinery now?! Wh-What's all this ruckus? Downstairs! I will take the Ultimate Aja from you! Locating it cost ACDC his life, and I will not let his death be in vain! Shining The sword protruding from his arm is shining! I am called "Crystal Cars" for my mastery of the Shining Sword! Th-This cannot be The sword protruding from his arm is formed from the crystallization of his ulna or skin and he's not using it to deflect the b*ll*ts! He's defying the Laws of Physics by severing high-speed, spinning b*ll*ts in mid-flight! Why does that sword shine?! What's creating the light?! Mein Gott, he's coming straight at me! Wh-What's this sound?! As Cars made his advance, Stroheim observed and understood the secret of the Shining Sword! It wasn't just a sharp sword he was dealing with, but a high-speed, revolving chain of serrated teeth! An infinitesimal chain of sharp shark-teeth revolving in rapid succession around the sword! The crystal-structure of these teeth refract light, giving the illusion of a shining sword! I-I am still powerless! Even with these weapons and our advancements in Science, we are powerless to stop the Pillar Men! This "Santana" you refer to was naught but a whelp! A Neanderthal without thought! He was a peon in comparison to us! I think it's time I relieve you of the Ultimate Aja C-Cars! The shine of his sword is frigid enough to freeze It's sharp enough to slash straight through steel My bare hands can't defend against anything that sharp! If I even try to use the Ripple Fingers on him, I'd lose more than my fingers! If I could, I would run the Hell away right now! I don't stand a chance against Cars! I can't even think up a decent scheme against his sword! But I can't let him leave with the Ultimate Aja! If he uses it now to reach his ultimate evolutionary stage, then we're all buggered! Goddammit! I've got enough to deal with because of Wham's bloody ring, but now I've got to bear the brunt of Cars's choler! It's double-betrothal all over again! Is the Ultimate Aja in this pocket? It is, indeed! I've waited 4000, no, 5000 years to behold the luster of the Ultimate Aja! This was to have been mine from eons ago! Cars! Patiens! I will dismember you now! H-He's enraged, alright.This is a real pickle.He's got the Ultimate Aja now! Cars SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim has yet to be subdued! The technological advancements of the Third Reich have no equal! Shut your stupid mouth up, Stroheim! Why are you still trying to provoke him with your pomp?! Bathe in the light of my Ultraviolet Deathray! The gemstone's free! U-Uh it's sliding down the slope S-Scheisse! It's sliding down towards the cliff! If it falls into the chasm! Wh-What on Earth h-happened here? Cars! Get after the stone, Jojo! You've got a good lead over Cars! O-Oh crap Cars is making a bolt for the Ultimate Aja! And when he retrieves it, his momentum will send him straight into the chasm! He has no intention of stopping at the ledge! G-Goddammit! It's practically a 200-300 meter drop to the bottom! Cars could probably survive the fall without any issue, but I won't survive a fall that's around the height of the Empire State Building! C-Cars has caught up! Jojo's running with the intention of halting at the ledge, whereas Cars is dashing for a dive into the damned chasm! I can't let this twat have the Ultimate Aja! b*at him to it, Jojo! Jojo! When I catch up to and retrieve the Ultimate Aja, I'll be left vulnerable.You're going to make a lunge at me then, aren't you? Your main goal is to strike me with Ripple Energy, even if the Ultimate Aja falls into the chasm! Let's see how well your plan plays out! Jojo Is he! Spot on, Cars! I'll make a lunge at your back! H-He caught the chain of the Ultimate Aja around his foot! It's dangling like a damn pendant! What's with the belittling sneer? I'm the one who should be sneering, Cars! I figured you'd try to sneak off with it but you should've saved that idiotic idea for someone stupid! I lunged not at you, but at the snow beneath you, so I could actually stop myself before the free-fall! I retrieved the Ultimate Aja, not you! Have a nice trip, Cars! N-No way! That sword came outta his stinkin' foot! Jojo!!! Jojo! He's falling! H-His bloody blade's starting to assimilate into my body! Bugger off already! The distance to the bottom is exactly 170 meters! They'll crash into the chasm in about five seconds! I-I don't wanna plummet to my death if he's gonna survive the fall! Sticky Fingers! I-I'm too heavy! Ripple conductivity is at its highest with liquid matter, but crystalline solids are innately resistant, cutting Ripple conductivity! However, the heat generated by Joseph's hand is melting the icicle's surface, increasing Ripple conductivity and adhesion! I will have the Ultimate Aja, no matter the cost! H-Here we go again This tenacity of theirs is just terrifying! I can expose the vulnerabilities of my foes, but this Pillar Men Tenacity is just troublesome! It's like a bloody wild card to my ace in the hole! I will k*ll to have that stone! That glacial ledge has icicles too! I just need to free myself from this blade before landing! Wait! I could just channel the Ripple through this sword and straight into Cars! Time to croak, Cars! Typical! I knew that you'd attempt to channel the Ripple through my sole's sword! Therefore I need only kick you into the cliff! And now C-Cor blimey! H-He's unsheathed his Shining Sword! Cars threw Jojo into the cliff-face in order to have his body rebound, which will send Jojo back to him, straight into his sword! After I've given you a proper dismemberment, I'll retrieve the Ultimate Aja from the bottom of this chasm! No! Cut it, if you dare! You wouldn't risk destroying the Ultimate Aja to k*ll me, would you? My supporting scheme involves toying with your tenacity in attaining this stone! Here comes my Ripple Punt! You've used the Ripple to create a rope from the falling icicles by increasing adhesion! Unfortunately for you, there aren't enough falling icicles for you to use! Have no fear, I've got the length he requires right here! Caesar! I caught you just in time, Jojo! I demand an explanation! How could you two be so synchronized?! There's only one idiot who'd ever consider using icicles as a climbing rope.I knew that Jojo was the only guy idiotic enough to stir up this sort of scheme.That sums it up.Fortunately for me, you stooped to my strain of stupidity in order to realize my scheme.C-Come again?! You did good, mate! I'm chuffed to bits, Caesar m'boy! Also, if Lisa Lisa's up there with you, tell her that the Ultimate Aja's a-okay! I kept it from falling into Cars's grimy mitts! You were awful close though.Caesar, do pull him up immediately.I must admit, Crucco, your body's just chock-full of surprises, moreso than the Pillar Men.If you can refrain from your pompous banter, then perhaps we could cooperate.Jojo, I'll commend your fortitude.I'll grant you custody of the Ultimate Aja for only another day.Five Days Remain Until Marital Dissolution This is the face of the famous resort town of St.Moritz.The Mecca of Winter Sports, known also as the Sun Valley, it's an ideal destination for "refined adults" to seek some R&R.Or rather, it's a winter wonderland for the bloated buggers who can afford it! Even this cat has a pretentious prowl, as if they were the very reflection of their owner's snobbery.Oh, the snobbery! She didn't even reach for the shrimp tail! I'll bet this pretentious princess was protected from the problems of the people.Then let's see if a slice of smoked salmon will catch your fancy.A bite! Smoked salmon sits well with you, eh? All you gotta do is grab it.Just reach for it now Stretch those lanky legs of yours enough and checkmate! Caught you off guard, didn't I? The pretentious princess couldn't even nail a graceful landing.Boy, oh boy.I must admit, that was rather cruel of me.I'm losing my nerve as the days go by, and I've only got five left until that ring dissolves.Plus, I've got Crazy Cars to deal with now.The constant, yet impending thr*at of death is causing me to panic.Keep calm I've gotta keep calm in order to carry on, like I always do.Jojo, pay attention! Stand here and survey that structure with us.Sure! Be there in a jiffy.The address that ACDC had forwarded the parcel to matches that building.It's an abandoned, dilapidated hotel from the looks of things.It's an ideal defense from the day's share of sunlight.Every opening and window's been nailed shut with planks.No sunlight'll penetrate that hotel.Then Cars must be waiting for the sun to set from within, while also awaiting Wham's arrival.How should we proceed from here? We should seize this opportunity to att*ck! Agreed.While the sun still shines, Cars won't show his big-behind.Now is the time to strike! And you, Jojo? I am against this plan! We shouldn't strike while the sun's still out, not against him at least! We're facing a menace who's survived many millenia, solely on his wits.I'm certain that he's well-prepared for an afternoon as*ault! "Certain?!" He wants us to think that the path to him isn't laden with nasty surprises! Well I'm not falling for it! We'll be walking straight into his trap! Come on Jojo, you sound so reluctant.Where's that gusto of yours gone? "A crafty w*rlord wins his battles by making no mistakes." The Art of w*r emphasizes caution in a crowd of confidence, especially when there's little certainty of victory.Got cold feet, have you?! Cold feet?! If anything, my feet are calm, cool, and collected.I'd prefer that he come for us in the eve! But victory is certain! Cars is isolated and alone, while the four of us stand idle! We've got the numerical advantage so we should seize this opportunity, before Wham's arrival! Caesar, what's your bloody rush? You need to keep calm in order for us all to carry on.We'd be isolating ourselves by hurrying into his hideout! I am calm, and eager to exact vengeance! We both need to end the crusade our grandfathers started against the accursed Stone Mask! I will pulverize those Pillar Men! Vengeance?! For a codger you never knew?! Bollocks I say! If you were calm, you'd realize that k*lling yourself over a corpse is just crazy! Say that again, Jojo Why carry on the crusade of a codger you never met?! You'd be crazy to get yourself k*lled because of a corpse, you idiotic Italian! Caesar! You just crossed the line, Jojo! What line would that be, you-! Now you've done it! You deserved it! Stop smacking me already, Caesar! You started it, Jojo! Did not! Caesar, cease this nonsense! Jojo, stop your jabs! Caesar! Y-You bloody bozo Use your g*dd*mn head! What I say makes sense, doesn't it?! I thought you would've shared the same passion to end our grandfathers crusade as I, but I was wrong! I'm heading to the hotel.Caesar, Jojo's caution is not unfounded.We know nothing of the interior or layout of that hotel.We should wait until the eve to strike at Cars.My word is final, Caesar.Remember, your vengeance comes second to defending the Ultimate Aja.Forgive me, Maestra, but my vengeance comes first to me.Maestra, you know that my very blood burns for vengeance, because it was my own family that brought upon this calamity.The creator of the Stone Mask is near, and I will end the crusade of my grandfather! I can't stand by for the eve, while my family foe rests with ease! Mistress? Follow him, and if he even attempts an entry, bring him back bound.C-Caesar, why are you doing this? What's got you so fired up? Why can't you wait until we have an edge over him? Jojo.You struck a nerve regarding his very private past, unintentional, as it stands.A traumatic past that easily sends Caesar over the edge.His private past? Wh-What could've happened to him? I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time You've got my blood boiling, like my runt days in the Roman rookery! I was cold and cruel, and I will k*ll you! Very well! You have the honor of being hurled by wind of Whirlwind Wham! Episode 20 Caesar's Chilly Childhood
01x20 - Caesar's Lonely YouthQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:54Episode 20 Caesar's Chilly Childhood Caesar Zeppeli was born to the most famous furniture maker in Naples, Mario Zeppeli.Mario was a proud Neapolitan and a loving, reliable father of five, a man Caesar saw as his role model.But when Caesar was ten-years-old, that very same father walked out on his family without a word.Caesar's mother was already deceased, and the money left to Caesar and his siblings were swindled away by a distant relative.Caesar's disposition as a problem-child grew rampant, and his hatred for his father festered like a disease.I'll bet that prick shacked up with some whore and had another family! I'm gonna find and k*ll that culo, if it's the last thing I do! Caesar's youth was incinerated by his burning vengeance.He partook in several crimes including arson, battery, larceny, and petty theft.The only crime that hasn't sullied his hands is m*rder.His infamy made him a man to be feared, even by mafiosi.Be you the bambino who goes by Caesar? Whose son are you? I'm my own man! I'm sorry, you must not be Italian then.Y'see, we Italians like knowing who our fathers are.Caesar's regular routine of battery begins with an unrelenting wrench to the jaw, followed by an uppercut to his immobilized opponent.Caesar had yet to know that his fists were empowered with Ripple energy.And when Caesar was 16-years-old It's him That son of a bitch! he was ready to soil his hands after spotting his father in the streets of Rome.Alas! Wh-What are these things?! A diamond An embedded diamond.Giovane, don't touch that damn diamond! Vaffan-! What's with this wall? D-Don't touch these jewels They're booby traps Caesar was completely clueless to the crusade of his grandfather, Will A.Zeppeli, which led to his brutal death, and the dedication of his son, Mario Zeppeli, who traveled the world to learn the Art of Mystics for the sole purpose of defeating the very Pillar Men embedded within this wall.Caesar had no idea of the scope of their crusade.G-Giovane, hear my plea In Venice, there's a lady by the name of Lisa Lisa Only she knows how to deal with these damn things Whether it was by the pull of the wall or Caesar's matured visage, Mario was unable to recognize his own son in his final moments.Pa-! Caesar realized then Hurry! that his father left him and his siblings in order to keep them safe from the horrors of his crusade.Please, hurry Padre! Once, four folks arose from the fires of Hell Shijima no soko kara mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe and awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.Their ambition for power assembled Shinku no chishio ga the blood of a few bombastic braves.tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger! Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite He would exploit the flaws of the foes he faced! Yaiba surinuke yatsura no suki wo tsuke And his memory would live on for all posterity! Tsuranuita omoi ga mirai wo hiraku He's like a bloody storm! Atsuku like a bloody stone Red-hot like a bloody stone, ketsumyaku ni kizamareta innen ni but would he be ever free of the cursed fate of his family? Who can say, but the bonds of these braves Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna nigirishimete will never be buried.Caesar's Chilly Childhood Episode I get it now From that moment, his years of hatred for his father converted to profound pride for his family name.Caesar took up the cause of his father and began training in the Art of Mystics.Caesar owes Cars some payback for his pappy Sorry about that, Caesar.I had a cock-up about your granpappy with all the corpse-talk But if you're game to be walking straight into Cars's trap, then I'll bet you've got a scheme or two up your sleeve.I've changed my mind! If you're gonna as*ault Cars in the afternoon, then I'll be there to as*ault him with you, Caesar Zeppeli! Snowfall from last night left a fresh layer of snow and a pair of footprints.Wh-Who's that?! I could've sworn I saw something just now! Do my eyes deceive me?! They do not! They're honest! Who the Hell is that?! Caesar They've disappeared again! They can keep up this Harry Houdini act, but I know they've gotta be within five meters of me! Could this be one of Cars's tricks?! With the sun shining this bright, there's no way he could set foot outside! The Feline Feet! A fundamental stance in Wushu! Caesar is by no-means a practitioner of Wushu, but he instinctively adapted a flexible stance which would allow him to effectively anticipate and counter att*cks from any direction! Caesar! What's wrong with you?! The Mistress specifically told you not to attempt any entry! Stay where you are, Instructor Messina! I can't move a muscle now, let alone attempt an entry! Something's guarding the door leading within! "Something?" I see nothing, aside from snow-! Th-There's a footprint! It leapt! They're attacking from the air! You're Wham! Instructor Messina! This is bad! That was Wham, meaning that he and Cars are both holed up inside! But why?! How could Wham manage to bask in the sunlight?! Could it be related to his transparency?! Where is that provocative prattler at? I've heard of Jojo's remarkable growth from Master Cars.Where is the man responsible for Master ACDC's annihilation? Wind Wham possesses the mastery of wind, making his transparency the work of wind.And the pipes that are protruding from his abdomen are producing air.I can only barely make him out due to the steam from those pipes That's it! Those pipes are blowing out the steam in his abdomen, and he's coating his body with it! His body's undergoing the photorefractive effect! The steam surrounding him is causing sunlight to bend and refract, giving him a windbreaker from UV rays! That's why he seems transparent! Jojo's not with you.You are Caesar, the Bubble Blower, aye? Your reaction to my action was instinctive, leading me to believe that you too have grown as much as he.Very well! You will have the honor of being whacked by Whirlwind Wham first! "Whack" my ass, Wham! You've got my blood boiling back to when I was a rogue in the rookeries of Rome! Back, to when my proud father was ensnared by your booby trap! I was a cold and cruel criminal, and I will k*ll you! You think your wind'll burst my bubbles again, do you?! Well not this time! I've got the suds to slice through your wind! It's a technique inspired by Nonno Zeppeli's Ripple Ripper! Suds Saucers! They're high-speed, high-rotary spinning saucers of suds! The Ripple energy within each saucer makes them unburstable! Your windbreaker of steam is like a vacuum for my saucers to be sucked straight into your skin! H-His Ripple powers have improved vastly beyond my own expectations! You Mystic menace! You're not going back into the hotel without a few souvenirs! Skimming Suds Saucers! As you fall from being struck by my suds I'll finish you through my Ripple Kick! Wham's next reaction would shock Caesar! Caesar expected Wham to stabilize himself to stop from stumbling over in order to shorten the distance between himself and the hotel door.But instead of stopping Wham utilized the momentum of the fall to escape! Wh-Wham's no ordinary immortal ogre The intellect he displays in battle is nothing short of ingenious! But no matter his intelligence, he surely sustained severe wounds from my saucers Now I have the advantage! And I know just what scheme to use within to ensure my victory! At this moment, my senses are at the pinnacle of their peaks.I'm sensitive to even the slightest shift in the air.I'm on a high, like how I was back in the day.I'm without a bead of sweat, and my respiration's stable.I'll finish this fight with my reinforced Ripple powers! Instructor Messina! Are you ready to fight me without that windbreaker of yours now, Wham? They're gone! Both Caesar and Messina! Did they go inside the hotel already?! I-Is that an arm?! Be blown to bits, Wham! Bubble Blaster! I've burst these bubbles before! Suds Saucers! Fight me, you coward! I am no coward! Suds Saucers! You're washed up, Wham! Skimming Suds Saucers! Wham! Enough child's play! Savor my Sacred-! Hold your horses and survey your surroundings! The saucers I've unleashed have been orbiting the interior as Suds Lenses! Lenses? And that hole in the wall you escaped through is like the shutter of a camera, frozen in its photographic flash! The lenses will refract the UV rays of sunlight outside, and enlighten this interior! Sunlight?! You are paralyzed! Paralyzed into a strip of photographic film! Bathe and burn in the warmth, Wham! Deploying your windbreaker once more? Not while I'm around! This time, I'll finish you off directly with my Ripple energy! The single lunge in that single moment would cost Caesar dearly! The single moment when Caesar's body eclipsed the UV rays was the moment when Wham turned the tables on him! Once more, Caesar learned a painful lesson from the intellect of the weathered warrior! Surge forth Sacred Sandstorm! Th-This destructive force I-It couldn't be! could only come from Wham's Sacred Sandstorm! Then Caesar's been struck by it?! I am astounded by the strength of your growth I am sate Sate from a duel long overdue Master Mystic! My victory was but a close victory! Were it not for my Sacred Sandstorm which blasted back your Suds Lenses I would've succumbed to the sunlight of your saucers.Were Master Cars to have met and dueled you with his Shining Sword instead of my Sacred Sandstorm Master Cars would've emerged victorious, while sustaining injuries more grievous than my own.Enough.Your body now stands broken and battered from our battle.My Sacred Sandstorm has left your muscles and veins in shreds.Enough! Our duel is done.No longer will you feel even the slightest spark of Ripple energy, for you suffer from severe desanguination.The severity of this desanguination has doomed you to Death.Enough.Farewell.Go now, and begin your ascension.What?! The antidote to my wedding band?! What good would it do you? I fear not Death I am the proud successor to the Zeppeli family but I've failed in my crusade.An ogre would never understand the human value of family My father gave his life to save mine, unknowing that the life he saved was that of his own son's.Even Nonno relinquished his life and powers to save that of Jojo's grandfather, Jonathan.With the curtain of my life coming to a close, my final act must be as theirs! One final performance of panache before departing! My soul shines with the same zest of the Zeppeli men that preceded me! The zest of the human soul! Jojo!!! This is my Ripple of Rest! Take it away!!! Take it away!!! That was Caesar! That was Caesar's g*dd*mn shout! I heard it! Did something happen to him?! Caesar!!! He blew one last bubble with his blood.One last bubble infused with his remaining Ripple energy.He used his remaining energy to make a memento for Jojo, instead of channeling it into his fists Then he shall have it.I do not consider this an act of sympathy, but I do respect the strength and will of a warrior.An honorable warrior whose will and sacrifice is worthy of my respect.Your memory shall remain within my own for all eternity, Caesar A Mystic whose brief life burst as beautifully as the bubbles he bore.Th-The only tornado that could've torn through here is Wham's Sacred Sandstorm! If Caesar took his att*ck head-on! A bloody bubble Th-This couldn't possibly be Caesar's bandana is inside! And so is a ring! It's Wham's lip ring! This Ripple energy I feel is definitely C-Caesar's! Ever since we set foot in here, I tried so hard not to shout out for Caesar.I was too scared to shout out for him, because if I did and there wasn't any response from him, save for a serene silence, then I would know Know, what I tried so bloody hard to deny! But I can't deny it anymore I now know everything that happened in here from the sensation of that bubble, alone.Caesar d*ed shortly before we broke through! g*dd*mn him! g*dd*mn the snobbery of that irritable Eyetie! That prick left us stupid prezzies to boot! Caesar, where the Hell are you at?! Wakey-wakey! I'll dig you out, so just give me a sign, Caesar! Jojo! Do cease your sobbing and searching for Caesar already.Come again?! The odds are now even between them and ourselves.Two-on-two.That stairway of blood above is a real sigh of relief since Wham had surely sustained severe injuries from Caesar as well.We may be in their stronghold, but we'll still push on and persevere.Get to it, Jojo.Take that antidote and we'll begin our pursuit.Y-You heartless homegirl! Won't you shed a g*dd*mn tear or two for Caesar already?! Mistress Lisa Lisa your butt's backwards.Lisa Lisa is my Master, and as a master, she has to act cold to keep my focus fixed.But she's the one who really wants to wail n' weep for the man who looked to her as a mother and mentor.She's telling me to keep my eyes on the prize Caesar, I know I was a real selfish jerk in your eyes, but even I've learned to clue into the tune of another.Maybe I've matured some But when I m*rder them, they'll wish I was even more mature! I won't let your sacrifice be in vain! I-It's blood So Caesar's underneath Caesar Caesar! CAESAR!!! Within this hotel, Cars and Wham await the arrival of Jojo and Lisa Lisa, but their arrival will be postponed due to an outburst of emotion.Jojo screamed for Caesar ceaselessly, while Lisa Lisa shed tears for her tragic disciple.Jojo continued screaming with the expectation of hearing Caesar's shout, but it was not to be.Caesar was now deceased, and the serene silence that followed their anguished cries only affirmed this fact.His body may be gone, but his soul still lives on Under this slab, Caesar Zeppeli rests eternal.Next Time You've caught me in a foul mood.An embrace to end all embraces! When the full moon is at it's apex, we shall race! Both of you shall be broken before the break of dawn! Shine with me, Caesar! Episode Lisa Lisa's Long Sh
01x21 - The 100 vs 2 StrategyQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:54This hotel was originally constructed as a castle during the 14th Century.It was only remodeled into a hotel during the 20th Century, but when the landlord passed away in 1928, the hotels operations ceased.Cars was taken by the secluded hotel and used it as his stronghold against sunlight.Jojo and Lisa Lisa realized prior to their entry that they knew nothing of the hotel's interior, and may be entrapped in enemy territory.Shijima no soko kara Once, four folks arose from the fires of Hell mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe and awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.Their ambition for power assembled Shinku no chishio ga the blood of a few bombastic braves.tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger!

Tidy up the blasted place, will ya?! We're in foul enough moods already without these webs to worsen it! But this bloody trail is making me a bit cheery, since it tells me that Wham has indeed sustained severe injuries.Caesar slashed him up good before succumbing, I'll bet.We should finish him off before he recovers from his rest! Let's be on our way, Mistress Lisa Lisa! What's the matter? W-Well I find this creepy handle to be rather chilling.It's akin to holding the cold hand of another man.I am no door, ja?! Who was that?! Over here, Herr.And I am no door, ja?! He's a vampire! Back away from him! Jojo! If you weren't blocking me with those balls, I could've slashed the skin off your face, ja? I am Beck the Wire, ja? I was once imprisoned for strangling my sweetheart to death, but I made my escape and came across Master Cars, who offered me immortality, ja? He's my master, ja? And I won't allow you home-wrecking rats to disturb my masters' rest, ja? So, they've begun turning the populace into vampires for their own nourishment! Escaped, have you? Then personally, I think I'd better handle your execution, Escapee.Why don't you bend your head over and get ready for the guillotine? Mistress? You're a real sight for sore eyes, ja? Your skin's so silky-smooth too, ja? Let me embrace you, and I'll suck your blood to the last drop, ja? You've caught me in a foul mood.I'd rather be blind and deaf than see your filthy face and hear your shrill speech.However, you're welcome to try and attempt an embrace.An embrace leaving you anguished in your journey to the Afterlife.Spikes! Th-That's what cut 'em! His extra hand wasn't the one that split my bolas, but his spikes! He changed his body hair into wires and condensed them into sharp spikes! I despise it when women snub my sweet-talk, ja? It makes me want to strangle 'em more, ja? I'll embrace ja! I'll skewer and strangle ja in my loving embrace! Crikey! I didn't think he was that fast on his feet! Her muffler?! I get it! She's gonna channel Ripple energy into that muffler and use it on him! What's with the muffler? Are ja trying to strangle me with it? Hilarious, ja? It tears so easily, ja? Where are ja going? Let's continue on inside, Jojo.G-Got it.Her stroke was swift and as smooth as silk and the most effortless execution I've ever seen! Don't walk away from me, ja?! Herr Rat, that bitch deserves a good strangling, ja? Nein, ja yokel.You're finished, ja? She's done you in with her hold, ja? You been wrapped in the Ripple, ja? Who are you kidding, ja-! OHHHHH! NOOOOO! She's got a real handle on things! I thought her feminine side would make her frail n' feeble in a fight, but her technique is so much more refined than my own! Golly gee whiz! She's proved that her title of "Master" was well-earned! Jojo, you haven't taken the antidote Caesar left for you yet, have you? No, not yet Why? Well, I've decided to take the antidote after I whack Wham.When Caesar d*ed, he broke my "warrior's word of honor" with Wham, so I've sworn to Caesar that I wouldn't take this until after I've defeated Wham.Lisa Lisa, would you mind holding onto it until then? I would.It's not my burden to bear because I may already have another burden to bear.The further they pursued Wham into the hotel, the more they noticed that his trail of blood slowly turned into trickles.Jojo and Lisa Lisa were well aware of the symbolic meaning of these trickles for it represented the regeneration of Wham's wounds.They've arrived.I've been waiting for you Your growth is indeed remarkable, Jojo.I've got a bloody bone to pick with you, after what you did to Caesar-! Calm yourself, Jojo.Do divert your attention to the floor.Don't worry, Mistress.I am calm.I've seen the set of footprints on the floor, all right.The extra set, too.And they belong to Cars! Come out, come out, wherever you are! Stop hiding and show yourself! Yes, their footprints are the only ones which left a visible impression even though the respiration occurring within this room is several times their own! So it was her I see now.A wise woman with a warrior's intellect and perception.The force behind the miraculous growth of both Caesar and Jojo is now known to me! You've even sensed the abnormal respirations as well.You must be a master of the Art of Mystics! C-Cor blimey! Goddammit, they're all vampires! Are they mute, too?! That's rather unnerving! Cars! We are the Warriors of Night, hand-picked personally by Master Cars! We are one-hundred-strong, and on the command of our Master, we shall dissect and tear you two apart, Jojo! W-We're buggered! Mistress Lisa Lisa, what hope do we have against a hundred of 'em?! Master Cars, a moment! Jojo and I made an agreement to have our duel in the Colosseum, and avenging Master ACDC remains a prerogative.Master Cars, please acquiesce to our arranged duel! I shall not.Acquiring the Ultimate Aja always remains our main prerogative Make no mistake, Wham.Aiens.He makes a fine point, Wham! I ain't up for any duel, not anymore.I'm confident that I can defeat you, but even if I do, I've got a hundred vampires to face afterwards.Damned if I duel, damned if I don't.I just don't see the point anymore, especially if I'm doomed to die either way.I'm calling it quits Goddammit! They spotted my thread I thought I'd save myself the trouble of facing them with the Thread Shredder, too Minions, dismember them both! Dismember us, and the Ultimate Aja will be lost for all eternity.Cessatis! Speak sense, Woman! I am not so foolish as to deliver the very prize you seek so, straight into your hands.A device's been attached to the Ultimate Aja, and if neither Jojo nor I return by a certain time, the device will detonate, shattering the stone into shards.I won't buy into your provocation, Woman.But I'd wager that neither you nor your horde will find the stone in time.The expl*sive range itself is small, but it has enough force to leave the Ultimate Aja fractured.Did she seriously strap a time-b*mb onto the stone? It's news to me, but I'd better play along with her.She's not joking, Cars! We die, and bada-bing bada-boom, the stone's doomed.Be that as it may, I cannot allow either of you to leave alive! I agree, with a slight suggestion.I would allow Jojo and Wham to keep their arranged duel, and that would leave me to duel you, Cars.And the winner will receive the Ultimate Aja! Erk! Edepol! The winner will receive the Ultimate Aja, and the right to survive.Why prolong the inevitable? The battle for the Ultimate Aja and the future will end with one side left standing.Will the Pillar Men prevail, or will Humanity triumph? Curse you, Woman! Wham! Forgive my snicker, Master Cars.J-Jolly good! Lisa Lisa's long sh*t's even better than my own damn bluffs! You have bold words, Woman.I shall acquiesce and duel you for the Ultimate Aja! But make no mistake! Neither of you shall live to see the dawn! She's managed to bring us outta the fire and back into the frying pan! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's duel! Our duels will take place at another hour, in a more appropriate arena.When and where would you desire the duel, Wham? We duel tonight, when the full moon is at its apex.Our arena is located 15 kilometers south of here, at the base of Piz Berlina.We shall duel in the ancient hippodrome known as the "Skeleton Stone Heel." It is a sacred arena, where warriors came to claim glory from the heads of their fellows! A hippodrome?! Who said that you'd get to pick?! I ain't letting you two have the upper-hand! A peculiar, yet perfect arena for our duels, Wham.And in regards to the Ultimate Aja, Jojo You are to bring the stone to the hippodrome at the stroke of midnight, tonight.Without the expl*sive device, of course.Your master shall remain with us as our hostage! Lisa Lisa! They're ensuring that neither of us can renege on our word.I would do the same.Jojo, be a good boy and fetch the Ultimate Aja.You know where to look.I will, and I'll bring it straight to the arena.Believe me, Mistress.I already do.Caesar It was only yesterday when I stopped being such a self-absorbed bell-end.And this enigmatic emotion that has me on fire Could it be "compassion" for my fellow man? Goddammit! If only I could bash both their heads in now! Out of compassion, I swear to Messina, Lisa Lisa, and to Caesar's spirit, that I'll end this crusade! She didn't attach any time-b*mb to it, after all.Even I might've caved if they called me on that big of a bluff, you crazy cheat! Should I bring her a change of undergarments, or not? Who's this old crone? It's Nanna Erina! Why's Lisa Lisa carrying a picture of her around? What's with this one? "May 22, 1889." It's 49-years-old! Could this dashing gent be Great-Uncle?! Nanna Erina?! And Straits, holding a baby in his arms?! Lisa Lisa Come to think of it, I don't know a damn thing about her past, her present, nada.But why would she have these photographs? It's the genuine article.We shall keep our word as well and duel you both, one-on-one.Since you spotted these two photographs already, then I suppose I have some explaining to do.I was going to open up before your duel, regardless.Who are you? In 1889, Miss Erina lost her husband, Jonathan Joestar, on their honeymoon voyage over the Atlantic.Your grandfather, I'm sure you know.Before the ship sunk, Miss Erina saved the life of a little lass.That little lass was me.The little lass in that photo was me.H-Hold it If that was you 49 years ago If you were a baby 49 years ago h-how old would that make you, exactly?! F-Fifty, perhaps?! I-I-I-I-If you're in your fifties, then aren't you a-an old bag?! The math makes sense B-But you look like you're still in your late twenties.The Art of Mystics utilizes lifeforce, so I suppose your appearance could be maintained with the Ripple But that also explains why you're such an uncute, cold, old crone What if I said that I could see crows feet under your eyes? Minions, ready the arena for our duels! Light the cauldron! We're short on time for the full explanation but I'll cover what I can.You and I are related in many ways.Related? My parents d*ed due to the Stone Mask, and after Miss Erina saved my little life, her pregnancy made caring for me difficult, so she entrusted me into Straits's care.Sh-She gave you to Straits?! He disciplined me into the Art of Mystics, and entrusted me with the Ultimate Aja, as well.S-So basically, Straits was your foster father?! He was, and it brought me to sorrow to hear that old age drove him to madness.To be honest, I have conflicting feelings because of your hand in his death, but all life eventually ends in Death.Well I'll be damned C-Could this get any more awkward? I k*lled my Master's only father-figure Lisa Lisa's led a sorrowful life, just like Nanna Erina and I We're out of time for talk, Jojo.Wh-What's with these quakes?! They're ready.At last, the true duel can be underway with them Wh-What are they?! Make way! Those who don't will be trampled to death! Wh-What are those, dinosaurs?! N-No wait, they're horses, aren't they!? My Masters, make way for the chariot! The strength of these beasts bests my own! Master Wham, make way! These are excellent w*r horses.These horses had their brains pierced by the Stone Mask's spines, evolving them into Vampequines."V-Vampequines?!" Wham and Jojo's duel in this arena shall commence in the ceremony of chariot combat! "Chariot combat?!" Aye, akin to the gladiator-driven chariot races of the Roman Republic.You are to race these horses around the arena while dueling your opponent! Either driver may fall from the chariot, leading to an inevitable trampling, or be fatally struck by the opposing driver during the race! The victor is the last man standing! You're in for a ride, Jojo! Vampequines draw these chariots with the strength of 150 horses! Even Master Wham will struggle to hold tight to the reins! Wait a bloody second here! I'm game for chariot combat, chariot racing, whatever floats your boat, but not with these "vampequines!" They're your loyal lackeys, no?! Fret not.The reins are designed to conduct Ripple energy.Wham will control the horses with his sheer strength, but you will be able to steer the Vampequines with your Ripple energy.A-Are you sure about that? They look rather rabid Watch your hand there! You may steer them with minimal Ripple energy.Wham! Wham has adorned the garments of gladiators for this duel.He is determined.Determined to exterminate his foe, which is made ever-evident with his visage.Defeat him, Jojo.Humanity must triumph this morning! Show no mercy! Wham! I don't plan on taking your damn antidote until after I've kept my promise to Caesar, and pounded you into pudding.And this promise will imbue me with strength greater than I've ever known! Shine with me, Caesar! Let's ride, Vampequines! Next Time Wham! Cedo! Episode Gallant Gladiator
01x22 - A True WarriorQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:55To the victor, the Ultimate Aja! Jojo and Wham's ceremony of chariot combat shall be the first of two duels to commence! You may begin your duel when the moonlight is no longer obscured by the passing cloud above! Wham! Shut yer filthy flaps up already! Where are my cheerleaders, eh? One lap around the track is 960 meters, and these vampequines can easily make that one lap in one minute.Also, look to the pillar yonder.There will be a w*apon or two for us to take from that pillar after every lap.w*apon? The first to reach the w*apon will be the sole wielder for the entirety of the race.And the w*apon for this first lap is the Herculean Hammer! One stroke of that hammer would blow this chariot off to kingdom come! If Wham reaches it before I do, not only would I be buggered, but I'd be indubitably buggered! But if I were to take it before him, and coat it in oil to increase Ripple conductivity, he'd be indubitably buggered! I expect a battle of epic proportions from you, Jojo.The moon has neared the edge of the cloud The moonlight shall soon shine once more! Jojo, why are you off your chariot?! The moonlight will shine soon! You don't have to tell me twice, but a brisk start is the key to victory.I need to clear the rubble that's underneath my wheels.Hey Wham, there's a bit of rubble underneath your wheels, too.I'd clear them if I were you.Jojo, get back on your chariot! Jojo! Cedo! Episode Gallant Gladiators Cedo! What the-! M-Master Wham's spurt has been stalled! There's rubble under the wheel! He threw them underneath! That was quite crafty of him.Curses! While we were watching the moon unveil, he stooped to such trickery! Yer a dirty deceiver! Chiseler! Coming from decrepit corpses, I'll take that as a compliment! In a duel to the death, there's no shame in being a little dirty! No limits, no restrictions, all manner of foul play is fair game, you stinkers! He's approaching the first pillar! k*ll the human! Jojo will take the Herculean Hammer Why, good evening to you there! I'll hold you soon, my dear hammer! You're mine now! Th-The breakneck speed of these steeds is loosening my grip! Oh, Hell! Jojo! Whoa! I caught it on the ring on my bloody pinkie! A-At least I have the upper-hand on Wham now! And he's defenseless! You may have that hammer.It was never my desired w*apon to begin with.Wham has a plan for this man.A painful plan, concocted from the wisdom of a warrior! I have one greased Herculean Hammer that's ready to wreck! It's just waiting to smash your skull in, Wham! Wham's decreased the speed of his steeds Speed is not of the essence in chariot combat, but the rider's equestrianism and use of weaponry are both key to victory.As well as their instinctive tact.I think it's high-time I hold these horses up, so I can whack Wham once and for all! Jojo, you don't want to slow your steeds' speed there! You may have a hammer, but I Well Wham, are you ready to give a big, warm welcome for this here hammer of mine? Look! That happy-face he had from holding his hammer has all but vanished! H-His creative craft for warfare has exceeded my own! Damn! Jojo, lash your steeds and increase your speed! Too late! My stroke has forced you to abandon both your chariot and horses! The duel was done from the moment the pillar fell.How will he avoid my horses now? Jojo! The odds of the Vampequines trampling him to death is incredibly high, while the odds of him dodging either horse is incredibly low.Well Jojo, how will your cunning save you from this circumstance? M-My hammer Where's my hammer?! He wants his hammer?! He's got bigger things to worry about! He might as well hammer his own head with it now! He has to avoid those horses, but when he does, Wham will most likely halt his horses and slay Jojo with his Sacred Sandstorm! But above all odds, Jojo dashed straight for the oncoming horses! Good thinking, Jojo! Way to use your hammer! He slammed his hammer down onto the pole between the horses! The horses saddled forth from the strike! Jojo had used the Herculean Hammer to heave himself into the air! I-Inconceivable! He propelled himself above forelegs of the horses and escaped unscathed! Hot damn! And now, I think it's high-time that I play "Whack-a-Wham!" He's gone?! B-But where to?! The wisdom of Wham will always overwhelm that of your whelp's! I-I forgot! They can conceal themselves within the bodies of other organisms! Nice try! H-He left his boot! If it wasn't for that blasted boot Master Wham could've held his foot firm to the Vampequine! The jig is up! It was over the moment your ring caught this hammer for me! Lady Luck's smiling sweet fer me! Look at what you've done to yourself, Wham! You've trapped yourself inside the Vampequine and left yourself without a way to escape! Heave-ho! Be Rippled to bits, along with this horse of yours! The fool has yet to realize his own folly! Back off, Jojo! Get as far away from Wham as you can! Even after assimilating with the horse, Wham was never limited to just one arm! Neither was the Vampequines pace an issue for him! Meaning he'll be struck by the full extent of Wham's fatal flurry, as Caesar was! Savor my Sacred Sandstorm! The duration of this duel lasted about half a lap, but I admit that I found it to be fairly intriguing on two to three levels.Ultimately, not even that provocateur could best Wham's perfected prowess and psyche.I am to duel you next, but in all honesty, I derive little delectation from dueling a woman, as would Wham.Nevertheless, all meddlesome Mystics must ultimately meet their extinction.Neca te ipsum.The poison leads to a painless path.Jumped to conclusions, have you? Their duel has not yet ended, you dimwit.M-Master Cars, behold Master Wham! Impossible! Both of Master Wham's arms have been nearly severed! H-How could this be H-How and when were Wham's arms injured so?! Master, Jojo has awoken from the blow! He's moving, too! F-Fooled you once, fooled you twice! H-He was even struck by the full force of the Sacred Sandstorm Y-Yet, he lives! "Full force?" It was the full force of Jojo's craftiness that convinced you of his defeat.He's a chiseler by nature, and the best bluffer I know.Neither traits are commendable by convention.Behold Wham's waist, and the pieces will fall in place.C-Could he have tied Wham's arms together with reins which carried Ripple energy?! That would explain the sapped strength of the Sacred Sandstorm! When Wham reached to grab a hold of my leg, I figured that he could also use his other arm to strike me with the Sacred Sandstorm.I had to be a step ahead of him! Behold the visage of Master Wham! His face is pale and drenched in sweat! Master Wham's focus is also lost to the sky! Wh-What will we do?! They're entering the second lap! B-But how could furnish the pillar when Master Wham appears so bewildered?! Does Master Wham have any will left to duel?! He has been left aghast.Never before, has his most prided technique been desecrated so by Ripple energy.He's been left bereft of the pluck and pride he's procured over several thousands of years.The weathered warrior has never been left flabbergasted so by the bitter taste of plausible defeat.But "plausible" it remains! Hurry, and take the weapons for the second lap into the arena! That's Master Cars's signal! Then the riders shall have their weapons! The weapons for the second lap are the Cannonball Crossbows! Both crossbows come equipped with two cannonballs, and either rider may choose the larger or smaller of crossbows! W-Wait, there are two sizes to choose from now?! Lisa Lisa, perhaps the following thought is passing through your mind."Wham no longer maintains the focus needed to continue this duel, and yet, Cars still gave them weapons, aware of this handicap.It just doesn't make sense." Then let me enlighten you.I gave my handicapped rider weapons because he is alike a gallant gladiator of yore.In professional sports, there is an recovery ritual known as the "Handicap Hurdle." When athletes find themselves suffering the emotional setbacks from a handicap, they find a way to hurdle themselves over that handicap with a stimulus.The greater the emotional setback, the greater the necessitated stimulus.And Wham's necessitated stimulus was B-Bloody Hell! What's he done to himself?! M-Master Wham has gouged out his own eyes with his thumbs! I relied excessively upon my sense of sight and thus, was my sight exploited.But now, my sole sense of sight shall come from the wind against my horn! He stimulated himself so, that his focus shall remain forever fixed.Wham will no longer be hindered by any handicap.He's overcome his loss of eyesight with his "anemometer" of a horn, and will use the wind to perceive the projection of his foe.W-Well, whoop-de-doo! Gouging out your eyes changes nothing! What we gained from the stimulus of losing Caesar was the kick-in-our-arses your eye-gouging could never give! Which crossbow will you choose, Chiseler? Which will I choose? Obviously I'll choose the colossal crossbow! It packs a bigger punch than the other one! The punch is bigger, all right Indeed, it is.Wh-What the-! I can't pull the string back into the latch! I-It's a stiff string! Is it even physically possible for me to pull it back?! Serves you right! You'd need a conventional pulley to pull back the stiff string on that crossbow! Misfortune befalls the overambitious, doesn't it?! My first cannonball shall guide me to his gust.I've gauged the distance between our chariots.My final cannonball shall strike him down! Crikey! How can I pull this bloody string back?! Master Wham, trample that prattler into pÃ¢tÃ© for us! We shall dine upon the "pÃ¢tÃ©" of his remains! I-I figured as much! His horn can't discern my wind when there's a bloody bonfire blazing between us! Time to pull this string! Does he think a little heat will halt Wham's will? M-Master Wham is aiming his w*apon at us! He's turned his focus from the flame! Jojo will always be riding by the flame and exactly opposite of Wham.Therefore, Wham already knows where he is! So he's trying to deflect his sh*t off the walls, like the deflectors on a roulette table?! Bloody-! His ball struck me from behind?! I surveyed the entirety of the arena during our duel, and found a wall which would deflect my ball.B-Breathe! The ricocheted cannonball stopped short of hollowing his body out, but his expulsion of blood would imply intestinal injury.k*ll him, Wham! But be wary of his craft and cunning.Approach with caution! Will he attempt a counterattack? Wh-When the crossbow fell to the ground, the string reached the latch! I-I have to take him by surprise! I need him to be closer Close enough to make the sh*t count! N-Now! A counterattack! A commendable effort, but an absolute stray sh*t, nontheless.You have my respect for attempting to mount one final offensive.It's time, Jojo! B-Back off! G-Get the Hell away from me! Stay away! Just stay away! I'm begging you! H-Have mercy on me, Wham! Jojo! The chiseler's tossing pebbles at Master Wham! He's a coward, and a contemptible chiseler! Why dont'cha die with some pride, Poltroon?! Wh-Wham, you're gonna wail on me with the following "Don't you dare desecrate the sanctity of our duel, Jojo!" Don't you dare desecrate the sanctity of our duel with your cowardice, Jojo! Have some more! Even blinded bats could fly about and dodge these pebbles when it's sunny outside! But can you dodge what you can't hear, Wham?! Th-That cannonball he fired struck Master Wham from behind! D-Damn you Tricked you twice, tricked you thrice! I followed your cannonball's path of trajectory to strike you, like you did me! Silence befell the arena.Not a sound was stirred.Not a murmur was muttered.All eyes were focused on the hole hollowed out from Wham's chest, like the lid atop a pumpkin.The cannonball was small, but was imbued with Ripple energy.Wham's wounds begin to sizzle.The Ripple has now ruined Wham's arms, effectively sealing his Sacred Sandstorm forever.I-I need to use Ripple Respiration to recover You thought you could fool me with your falling feint, eh?! Well, you should've thought twice before lashing out! Ripple of Repulsion! He's won! Wham may no longer rise! H-How could I be reduced so How could I be humiliated so How could I allow my body of 12,000 years to be battered and broken so! W-Wait, both of his arms are gone! To seize victory, my foes must be forced to struggle and suffer! Though I am wrought with wicked wounds, and my strength has suffered such strain, I will use that which remains to grasp my victory! What-?! He's torn them He's torn both his arms off and fired them from the cavity in his chest! The bloody Hell! G-Goddammit! I can't use Ripple Respiration while he's strangling me! W-Wind? Why is there wind swirling around him?! I shall unleash my ultimate technique! His ultimate technique?! H-He wouldn't! Wait, Wham! Cease compression, now! Th-The wind's being sucked into his pipes! Witness my Wind of Destruction! I will remember you Your silhouette will charge the view Of distance atmosphere Call it morning driving thru the sound and Even in the valley In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they Stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching Down on the land Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees The rim of the land The eagle's dancing wings create as weather Spins out of hand Next Time Scatter, you scum! I will do what I must The posture he strikes You just crossed the g*dd*mn line to lunacy! Only one may stand tall above all other organisms! Episode Waning into the Wind

Your seat by the flame obscures my sight Jojo, I cannot clearly define your projection, but as you now suffocate from strangulation, you are powerless to avoid my Wind of Destruction as it inches towards you! Towards total decapitation! Wham's Wind of Destruction is his ultimate technique.The very pipes he used with steam to shield himself from sunlight may also be used to intake a great deal of air which will undergo ultra-compression within his lungs.He then forces the air to exit through a small slit in his horn using ultrahigh-pressure, which manifests as a small cyclone.However, in order to accommodate the ultrahigh-pressure, his body undergoes extreme strain.Strain so extreme, that his body begins deteriorating as a consequence of usage.But I find that frailty to be quite captivating.Do decapitate him for me! Do so, and I shall acquire the human blood required for your rejuvenation! Jojo! I-It's close! I need to cook up a scheme, quick! I'll use my canteen of kerosene! H-His pipes are sucking all the wind into his gut like suction tubes, but if I can splash his pipes with this kerosene and flame, they'll suck up all the flaming vapor and cause an implosion! This is literally my last ace in the hole! It's do-or-die now! I have you now! Goddammit! Suck on this, Wham! An expl*sive lamp? Pathetic.I may pierce any projectile flying within one-meter of my being.Your schemes are all but spent, and your burning bark has betrayed your bearings.Witness my Wind of Destruction! Caesar!!! Save my skin! Another attempt to light the lamp? Try as you may, but my wind will blow away anything within a meter of me! And now, our duel will finally end after I've decapitated you! Jojo! A-At long last Wham Your defeat was determined from the moment I tossed Caesar's bandana at you.I wanted you to slice my canteen in half, you half-wit! Your pipes' ceaseless suction of the canteen's contents was essential to your defeat! You've been sucking aerosolized kerosene vapor into your gut, as well as Caesar's shredded bandana! The The flames are still lit, and my pipes are sucking the flames within! Wham, you were the most adept adversary I've ever had, but the combined effort of my fallen friend and I defeated you in the end.H-He lost Master Wham's been whacked! Remember Jojo, all Pillar Men can recover from any injuries sustained, even from explosions! The only certain way to defeat them is by channeling Ripple energy on contact! O-Our duel has finally ended Jojo It did.Have you avenged Caesar? I have.Then go, and deal unto me Death.I will! What are you doing?! The fumes curling up from your head's not smoke from the implosion, but vapor from being ruined by the Ripple.Ruin which originated from the energy that I had channeled into your chest and legs.I've seen how much suffering the Ripple brings your people, and although your body's blasted to bits, the least I could do is alleviate your anguish with my blood.How dare you! Do not force me to suffer in such shame! I need not your sympathy! "Sympathy?" You wanna talk to me about "sympathy?" Then tell me why you left the blood bubble containing Caesar's bandana and your ring intact.Was it out of sympathy? I left his bubble because he was a proud and honorable warrior! I only paid my respects to an honorable warrior! You'll now spout, "Are you doing the same?!" Are you doing the same?! You bet I am.Respect is to be paid to my adversary, and my solemn respect is due to my fallen fellow, Caesar.Even after everything you put me through, I cannot help but pay my respects to you.And paid it was, in my blood.You've left me in utter defeat, Jojo.It seems that your warrior ways are more wondrous than my own.k*ll him! Halt! Stay your hands! Scatter, you scum! Wham! Wh-Why did you do that?! I am dedicated to Master Cars until the end, but I will not tolerate such treachery from our servants.I left Caesar's bubble whole out of respect, not sympathy.I acknowledge only the strength and will of a warrior.And only the victor may respect the final will of his fallen foe.It is this very will in which I've disciplined myself.Jojo Not once, have I ever yearned to prolong the eternal life that I've been endowed So long as I could wither away in this will of my own.Now keep your word and take the antidote.Before I am reduced to ashes.How will you know? I need not rely on my view, wind, or words.Your actions will speak the truth to my ears.My life is fulfilled.I am truly overjoyed to have witnessed your miraculous growth.Perhaps I spent these 12,000 years of my life in search of you.Aeternum vale, Jojo Wham waned into the wind.As Jojo watched, he unconsciously shifted his stance into a salute to the fallen warrior.He shed not a single tear, but his silence served as a eulogy for his enemy.He felt an unusual fellowship between himself and Wham.Wham, I order you to k*ll him.I-If I may have a word, Master Cars The object of your aggression is but a boy! A boy he be, but he must die.The child of Mystics must never mature into adulthood, lest he becomes a great thr*at to our survival.It takes only a decade for a boy to become a man! k*ll him now, Wham! If your warrior's will withholds your hand, then allow me to illustrate how our survival is ensured! A swift stroke is all it takes! Wham Your wholehearted warrior's will was what wasted you away! It wasted away your will to win! Wham whacked the bucket.I had me rations riding on the rotter, too.And what a wuss he was! The filth of these fools doesn't fail to foul the mood.M-Master Cars! Y-You're sucking me dry! I am all that's left of the Pillar Men However, there need only be one to stand omnipotent over all others! Master Cars has finally tossed his turban! He's ready to duel! But there's no need for Master Cars to sully his own hands on these humans! To Hell with the duel! We'll k*ll 'em both for ye! I'll be the first to bathe in their blood! They were gonna ambush us, after all! Do recall our arrangement.Th-The Ultimate Aja! I, and I alone, am to duel Cars.And if any were to interfere and renege upon our arrangement, then I will smash the Ultimate Aja into shards! I gave you my word, and I will duel you alone, as I had always intended.The very unveiling of my horns signifies my intention to duel you.These filthy few who've dared to thr*aten our arrangement have already fallen.Master Cars?! I will attain the Ultimate Aja, for the sake of my fallen fellows of several millenia.I will duel you with the exact dignity they both displayed in battle.You meddlesome Mystics will be massacred by me, for I must now avenge both of my fallen fellows.And Lisa Lisa, the aggression you've shown my minions was nothing short of masculine.It is a man I face, and a man I shall mutilate! Follow me! This shall be our arena! It is the Shrine of Skeleton Heel Stone! Long ago, the victors of chariot combat would ascend this shrine and drink a mixture made from their fallen foe's blood with wine.They would thank their gods who've graced them with longer lives.An arena it is not, but it is ideal for an invigorating duel.M-Mistress Lisa Lisa! You may be the Master, but you're still just a woman! He seems a lot weaker than Wham was, so let me duel him instead! Too bad.I don't need the burden of having a boy worry about an old mare like me! F-Fearsome-Fifties are fierce! As I maintain mastery over the Shining Sword, it would be unworthy of the will of Wham to not offer you a w*apon as well.You may use any of those arms.My muffler is my arm.So be it.Let us begin.Th-This aura that he emanates is bereft of bloodlust.How will he duel me without the will to k*ll? Won't you come at me already? Then I will act first! Cars has concealed himself with that small shine of light! Where's he gone?! C-Cars's aura has vanished It's almost as if he could ambush me from anywhere! Shining Sword! He hid himself within the fissure of that pillar! Mamba Muffler! This muffler was made from the intestines of many Satypolasia beetles, and is incredibly conductive to Ripple energy! It works both as a w*apon and a lifeforce locater! It's what gives me eyes around the back of my head! H-He's dead! The Master massacred that mook! Cars was a wimp compared to Wham, but cocksure jerks are always k*lled-off quick! I always knew she had more moxie than me- M-Master Cars! C-Cars is behind her?! Th-Then who the Hell did she hit?! N-No way! That can't be true! Cars's wasn't dueling her at all! It was his look-alike! Damn the duel.Damn the arrangement.Damn everything, save for my acquisition of the Ultimate Aja, so that I may become the True Omnipotent Organism.I have no will of a warrior alike the likes of Wham! I will use any and all means at my disposal to s*ab Defeat through the heart! Th-That's why his aura felt so bereft of bloodlust He never intended to duel me at all On the ground! Jojo The Ultimate Aja is mine! Now my minions, go and mutilate Jojo with all your might! C-Cars! Now you've done it! Get outta my way, you jagoffs! I'm gonna bust your bloody brains in! Zoom Punch! Yer Ripple powers are worn.He's exhausted his Ripple energy-! Ripple of Repulsion! You have yet to fully recover from your duel with Wham.Your respiration is in disarray, reducing the potency of your Ripple powers.No matter how well your master maximized your strength and stamina, you won't last long against my whole horde! Jojo Just how long will you last? Y-You goddamned son of a! Tear him apart, boys! C-Cor blimey! U-Ultraviolet light?! I know that mug! Hear me, you vile vampires! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim and the SS of the Third Reich shall silence you! The Speedwagon Foundation's Special Task Force shall join them as well! Jojo! Yo, Jojo! G-Great-Uncle Speedwagon! And my buddy from the Big Apple, Smokey Brown! My right leg is rearing up for vampire violation! The repairs to my body have finally finished as well! And now, allow me to introduce our newest venom against vampires! The Uber Ultraviolet Ray Cannons! It was actually my foundation that succeeded in mass-producing the mobile models, but he was quite adamant on adding a dash of Deutsch.So the trivial tools of the Teutons have returned Jojo is gone! Where has he jolted off to? The swiftness of your sprint never ceases to surprise.My eyes need only wander for a moment, and you'll spring me with your next scheme.You've crossed the bloody line over into lunacy.You gave your word that you would duel Lisa Lisa, but you used some slimy tactics to s*ab her in the back! Overall, your dishonorable conduct has besmirched the warrior's will of Wham! Agitated, are we? Well do try to calm yourself.Do understand that I would do anything to achieve my main prerogative, no matter the indecency of my implemented tactics.I did that which carried the least amount of risk and worry, and played the game at my own pace.Victory to the most patient of players! And now, you shall suffer from this new game that we shall engage in.Never before have I loathed anyone with the same malice that I do you! You loathe me? Then let's alleviate your loathing! If it's a duel with me that you desire, then a duel with me you shall have! Lisa Lisa is lapsing within the limbo between Life and Death, exactly as I wanted her.I left her with as little life as possible.Would you like to know why? She still has a part to play in our game.In fact, her part is quite literally tied yours.Twang Twaaang You sick, twisted I've threaded rope through the holes in her feet, Jojo.Would you like to know why?! It's because Li-Lisa Lisa! catching her is your part in our game! If you don't grab ahold of her rope, she'll be skewered by the crystals below! J-Jojo! Lisa Lisa! Li-Lisa Lisa?! Isn't that the baby Nanna Erina saved from that sinking ship during her honeymoon? I-If that's her, then she's actually Jojo's You are to remain paralyzed in that position.My tactics have left you trapped, Jojo! I will slowly, but surely, advance towards you and dismember you at my own leisurely pace! g*dd*mn you, Cars! g*dd*mn you to Hell and back! Jojo doesn't know that Lisa Lisa is actually his mother!

Damn you, Cars! Damn you to Hell and back! Jojo doesn't know that Lisa Lisa is actually his mother!

It takes more than a minute or two to slaughter all diese Scheisser, ja?! Verdammt! Die, Damonen! Dammit! Stroheim and his SS have their hands full! Jojo! Hold hard to that rope, or she'll slip from your grip.The range of your reactive lunges have been severely limited by the length of this little rope, aye?! Cars didn't receive any Ripple energy from slashing Jojo's leg?! Th-That ain't no good! Your respiration's in disarray, and your Ripple energy's exhausted.Ergo, I may assume that you possess just enough energy for one final att*ck.I will pluck the pulp of Life from you, alike petals being plucked from a flower.Cars! To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure if I can force any energy outta me.I'm really not.But nevertheless I've cooked up a new scheme! A scheme that'll sweep you off your feet! Are you dying to know what my ingenious scheme is? Well I ain't tellin'! Jojo! It better not involve tying Lisa Lisa's rope to your own! It's the flame from a match! And guess what I'm gonna do with it! Wh-What the hell're you doing, Jojo?! You've lit up your own muffler! I'm gonna motivate myself into channeling one last att*ck before incurring immolation! It's my double-edged draw! And I ain't foldin' on this flame until I've ruined you with a Royal Flush! Jojo, I would determine your "ingenious scheme" to be infernally ill-fated by fire! Cease this charade! Your scheme consists of recovering Ripple energy as you run about! I won't have it! I will make your execution my most effortless! I won't stand for your fictive vine-swinging nonsense! That's too bad! I will respire, one way or another! Listen well.At any given point during our game, I can simply sever your master's rope.Swing about once more, and down she goes! Do you want to see her skewered below? Yes or no? Here goes the rope Stop it! Then stop swinging around.I want you to walk towards me, now.You don't have to come, if you're willing to have her blood on your hands.That coward! What will it be? Do you treasure your own life over the life of this woman's? Die! You've chosen an unexpected alternative, but if you want to fall to your deaths together, then I shall sever this rope and oblige you! Jojo! Lisa Lisa! The Ultimate Aja is finally mine, and the Mystics are no more! The rope?! But how?! It's tied around Jojo's ankle! But when did he tie it around his ankle?! I never gave him an opportunity to When he made his first lunge, he swung the rope around his leg so that I'd sever a spare rope for him! Then, he secretly tied the spare rope around his ankle and Lisa Lisa's rope, and made a loop from it.And this all went unnoticed due to his diversion with the flaming muffler.He even managed to lure me into his damned loop! That provocateur purposely provoked me into severing Lisa Lisa's rope to do it, too! Curse your accursed deceit! Now, your role is to support both of our weights combined! You're a deceptive deceiver, Jojo! It doesn't feel good to be on the receiving end, does it?! You're a decent deceiver, but I suppose you don't handle being deceived too well! You've been around for tens of thousands of years, but the only way you'll ever match my smarts is by spending ten years in the modern day, Cars! Get ready for the Ripple! Ripple of Repulsion! D-Did I get him?! Th-That was the last of my energy! My Ripple energy's all spent! I can't channel another bloody Ripple I-I channeled it into him! He did it! He sure did! He cracked Cars with the Ripple! Not you! C-Curse you! Look! Cars has been impaled by the crystal spikes from his fall! He's finally fallen! Behold! Ripple energy is starting to spread straight up his arm! He is now weakened! He is now finished! Even our Uber weapons could k*ll him now! That was shocking, ja? But now, he's ours for the taking! Ready the Ultra-Uber Ultraviolet Ray Cannon! Jawohl! Mistress Lisa Lisa Cars said that he'd left a smidgen of life in you Supposedly, he stopped short of striking your vitals.If we patch you up now, I think you'll live to see the sun rise again.It's over At long last Say, Mister Speedwagon? Mind if I pry a bit? What is it? Why did Nanna Erina tell Jojo a straight fib? That his mother passed away ill during his childhood? Why was Miss Lisa Lisa hiding the truth from her own son? Smokey, I can't I know you asked me not to ask Nanna herself, but I wanna know.They're family, right? Why do they need to hide that from each other? Smokey I consider Nanna Erina and Jojo to be good homies of mine.They both stood up for me against a r*cist and two corrupt coppers back in NYC All for a rotten hood like myself! I flew here for my homie, and I always wanna have his back! All right, Smokey.I'll tell you the story.You did do a gentleman's duty by looking after Miss Erina during my absence.But you are never to tell Jojo a word! This is an affair between members of the Joestar Estate, and we outsiders may not interfere with their wishes."Lisa Lisa" is an alias An alias for "Elisabeth." She was raised by Ripple Master Straits, and eventually met, romanced, and married Miss Erina's son, George Joestar II.George and Elisabeth eventually had their one and only son, Joseph.George was a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and even with the unexpected advent of aerial warfare during World w*r I, nothing stopped George from taking to the skies with his wings.His spectacular performance in the RAF earned him the popular nickname of "The Blue Baron!" However a foul stench surfaced from the sewers of the past to sicken us once more! 49 years ago, Dio Brando created his very own horde of vampires.Both Straits and I were certain of their extermination by our own hands, but alas! One escaped us and went into hiding, where they lived incognito for decades! And that vampire was one smart stinker, all right He never made a horde of his own, and he even devoured every bone and hair strand on his prey in order to avoid drawing attention to his true nature.I was dumbstruck to discover that he was a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force! Th-The RAF?! The same RAF Jojo's pop's was in?! The very same.George was the first to uncover his true identity after hearing about Dio's stories from both Straits and I.But George was just a simple John Smith! He had the talent and aptitude for learning the Art of Mystics, but he never had any formal training! Before he could attain any evidence of the Wing Commander's identity, that damned vampire had already spotted him! And before he could call and inform Straits Officially, George d*ed after his plane crashed during a routine night-flight.Both Straits and I conducted our own investigation for the true cause of death, and we learned of his Wing Commander.The night I told Elisabeth the truth was the last night she'd ever cradle her beloved baby-boy.Rather than weep over my report, she immediately left the Estate! Elisabeth was a Ripple Master! However, she was vengeful and without restraint! The Wing Commander's subordinate witnessed her m*rder him! The RAF knew nothing about the Art of Mystics or vampires.All they knew was that one of their exceptional Wing Commanders was k*lled by a "wicked woman" who had set fire to his body after the m*rder! An enemy of the state, Elisabeth would be wanted worldwide for the infamy of murdering a RAF Wing Commander! My Foundation did everything in its power to erase any trace she'd left, and Elisabeth entered exile without a word.Without even a word to her beloved baby-boy.Miss Erina spoke a somber request to me after Elisabeth's exile.If Joseph ever asks about his parents whereabouts, tell him that they both passed away.Let him be spared from it all.And thus, Elisabeth became "Lisa Lisa." Why Why not tell him?! What bad could come from knowing that his mom's still around?! I felt her pain! The very pain Miss Erina felt after losing both her husband and son to the Mystic's crusade against the accursed Stone Mask! That is why she wanted her one and only grandson, Joseph Joestar, to never learn the Art which cost her both her husband and son! That is exactly what Lisa Lisa wanted as well! I feel for this family This unfortunate family! But Jojo Jojo just saved his own mother with that very same Art! Mister Speedwagon There ain't no reason left to hide the truth no more, right? He needs to know that he saved his own mother with the Art of Mystics! True But it's not our decision to make! We'll have to run it by both Miss Erina and Lisa Lisa, first! C'mon SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, the cannon is ready! Good! Put him between the crosshairs! The Third Reich shall be responsible for k*lling Cars! Jawohl! Here comes the countdown, Cars! The countdown to your very doom! Stop, Stroheim! He's wearing the Stone Mask! And the Ultimate Aja's embedded within! Don't shine it on him! M-Mein Gott! Shut it down! Shut the Ultra-Uber down, now! Sch-Scheisse! H-How could this be?! When did he adorn the damned Stone Mask?! When was the Ultimate Aja embedded in the damn thing?! O God in Heaven! Cars!

By adorning the True Stone Mask, he's attained the Attributes of Omnipotence!

01x26 - The Man Who Became GodQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:58Eons ago, an omnipotent organism yearned to learn the meaning of "true omnipotence." He could soar amongst the birds, and reside within the watery depths of the sea.His energies stemmed from the very Earth that bore him, and he moved with the swiftness of water.But this organism could not run under the Sun, which is why he created the Stone Mask.With it, he dreamt of the day when he could embrace those radiant rays, and rule absolute over the Earth.Episode A God Amongst Men But has Cars Has Cars been cast into the magma chamber?! C-Curse you! He has! M-My armor Needs to be as concrete as a crustacean's! I-I shall adorn my armor! I-It melts! It's melting straight through his armor! That magma's over 1000Â°C! And I hope your corpse undergoes a thorough cooking, Cars! Autsch! H-He's dead! Finally We've finally k*lled Cars! Jojo, that expl*si*n's set off a chain reaction for an eruption! You can celebrate all you want after we're off this rock! Grab ahold of me, my good Jerry.A sweet scream A very sweet scream, indeed.In fact, it's the very scream I've been waiting eons to hear, Jojo! Cars? How is he still?! Cars's armor? Incredible It's composed from At first, Cars attempted to adapt a crustacean's carapace, but no organic armor can withstand magma! As a result, the molten-hot magma melted his armor away.However, his secret, secondary defense compensated for his melted armor! His secondary defense consisted of a bubble barrier! By expelling bubbles, Body Air Magma Cars cooled the magma surrounding his body, which created a barrier of air! While that air barrier only momentarily neutralizes the magma, Cars can continuously counteract and cool the magma with his bubbles in order to continue any activity within the magma chamber! All life was borne from the crust of the Earth, but at long last, Cars the Creator has conquered the very lifeblood of the Earth! Eons ago, before the emergence of the h*m* sapiens species, an evolved hominid species had dominated the Earth.This hominid species was strictly nocturnal, as they would perish under the shine of sunlight.For this reason, they we're forced to live underground.Even without the aid of daylight, their longevity could be prolonged by hunting other organisms.When the Neanderthal species emerged, they worshipped their nocturnal counterparts either as gods or devils.The nocturnal hominids were often impervious to Death, which made reproduction a rather rare event.As a result, their population was quite limited.But their practices allowed for the establishment of a peaceful community.However a cunning outcast was created from this very community.There are prodigious powers still concealed within this shell of mine.I shall unseal these concealed powers! The cunning outcast created the Stone Mask.His creation coaxed forth his imperishable powers, but necessitated nourishment far greater than the norm.Nourishment which would leave the presence of other organisms scant.His creation would surely diminish the wildlife required for the community's survival.As a result, the community became fearful of the Stone Mask.They were fearful of the cunning outcast.His continuance shall bring about calamity! His existence must be eradicated from the Earth! k*ll the Cunning Outcast! Hear me, imbeciles! Do you not dream to walk under the daylight?! Have you no ambition to stand omnipotent over all others?! Who would dare to not triumph over Terror, itself?! Death to the Doomed.The Cunning Outcast exterminated his entire community, including the very parents who bore him.He adopted a child he had personally orphaned, and together with his compatible contemporary, left on an ambitious adventure.An adventure, which would have him hunting for a way to attain "true omnipotence." 10,000 years later, the Cunning Outcast would finally attain "true omnipotence." He is a god He is a true god! He is a god amongst men, and men cannot k*ll a god! We can only submit to his omnipotence! Come again? Sorry Jojo, but you'll have to speak up.Ripple of Repulsion! "Rip-ple?" Ripple this! Jojo! It can't be! M-Melting?! But how?! How's me leg melting?! Melting?! That could only mean that I may utilize the Ripple! You simpleton! Now that I've vanquished my vulnerabilities, I too may utilize the Art of Mystics, you incompetent "arsehole!" Th-That's impossible! From your wound, it would appear that my potency overpowers yours by a several hundred times! His powers are a several hundred times more potent?! Then it's like being struck by the Sun itself! And the Sun would easily melt away and vaporize anything, even flesh! Hurts, doesn't it? How do you like being on the receiving end? Ecstatic, from the sound of your screams.And your screams beckon me to silence you.Jojo! I'm done for Cars is coming in for the k*ll.Jojo didn't try to break from that belief.He was without fear, without pain, and without any regret, because he thought that he did all that he could do.Cars the Creator met the cold eyes of a man who lay before him, who was calmly awaiting his impending death.Stroheim shared Jojo's beliefs.Paralyzed and static from shock, he understood how a frog felt before falling prey to a python.This is the Art of Mystics My Mystic Meddler, this ceremony shall end with my ascension into Omnipotence after I've channeled Ripple energy into you! Rip-ple Potency that is far-beyond my own Melt away into the oblivion of that magma chamber! Channel it, will you?! What's this?! The Ultimate Aja?! What's this?! The Ultimate Aja?! The Ultimate Aja! At that moment, not even Jojo realized why he attempted to block Cars with the Ultimate Aja.Unconsciously, he felt an attraction between the hand holding the Ultimate Aja and Cars's Ripple.But subconsciously, Jojo's body knew the truth! Subconsciously, his body was fighting for survival! Jojo's subconsciousness empowered his survival instincts with a great shove! Th-The Ultimate Aja's actually a Ripple amplification apparatus! With that amplification of Cars's Ripple energy, the volcano's eruption occurred within an instant, and breached the bedrock! Th-That eruption blasted them both and the bedrock sky-high! Th-This is a pressure I've never experienced! But did you honestly believe that I'd let the eruption blast me away, Jojo?! I shall take to my wings to avoid entering the atmosphere! Aeternum vale, Jojo! Thank God for Gaia's Grace! The eruption blasted my bloody arm all the way up here! And now you'll ask, "Was this all a part of your plan, Jojo?!" Was this all a part-! It was at this very moment, when Cars was caught off guard by Jojo's severed arm, which would determine his doom! The volcanic ash that Cars could've avoided had struck their target, propelling him beyond the troposphere! Was this all a part of your plan, Jojo?! You bet your arse it was! I've got a plan, a scheme, a trick for every smelly pickle in the pocket! Boy, can I bluff But at least I can finally have the last laugh! Volcanic ash from the eruption blasted far-beyond the troposphere and well into the stratosphere, but even Cars couldn't be k*lled by an eruption from the Earth! However, that eruption expelled Cars beyond Earth's atmosphere and straight into outer space! Stars?! I-It cannot be! It's finally finished Nanna Erina Stroheim Great-Uncle Speedwagon Smokey and Lisa Lisa I'm out, everybody Jo JOJO!!! Eight hours later, after Stroheim was rescued from Vulcano Isle, he had only this to say to Speedwagon.February 28, 1939 An eruption off of Vulcano Isle ended Joseph Joestar's life.I've entered outer space?! If I can expel the all the steam from my abdomen in order to reverse my trajectory, I can re-enter Earth's atmosphere! I-I've failed! I-I'm freezing! O-Oxygen is being sapped from my body! The deeper into space I drift, the quicker the oxygen deprivation! I-I can't fly back! I CANNOT RETURN! Cars would never return to Planet Earth.He became an amalgamation of inorganic and organic matter, and drifted aimlessly throughout the galaxy.To the undying Creator, Death was all that he dreamt of, until one day, when every transient node in Cars's cranium ceased to function.New York City Outskirts April 1939 Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.Your kingdom come, your will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven.Goodbye, Jojo Come to think of it, we've only know each other for 'bout half-a-year.But I'll never forget you 'Til the day I die Never.Miss Erina, I think it's time we went on our way.Let us be off.Let me be Guess who?
