01x26 - The Man Who Became GodQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:58Eons ago, an omnipotent organism yearned to learn the meaning of "true omnipotence." He could soar amongst the birds, and reside within the watery depths of the sea.His energies stemmed from the very Earth that bore him, and he moved with the swiftness of water.But this organism could not run under the Sun, which is why he created the Stone Mask.With it, he dreamt of the day when he could embrace those radiant rays, and rule absolute over the Earth.Episode A God Amongst Men But has Cars Has Cars been cast into the magma chamber?! C-Curse you! He has! M-My armor Needs to be as concrete as a crustacean's! I-I shall adorn my armor! I-It melts! It's melting straight through his armor! That magma's over 1000Â°C! And I hope your corpse undergoes a thorough cooking, Cars! Autsch! H-He's dead! Finally We've finally k*lled Cars! Jojo, that expl*si*n's set off a chain reaction for an eruption! You can celebrate all you want after we're off this rock! Grab ahold of me, my good Jerry.A sweet scream A very sweet scream, indeed.In fact, it's the very scream I've been waiting eons to hear, Jojo! Cars? How is he still?! Cars's armor? Incredible It's composed from At first, Cars attempted to adapt a crustacean's carapace, but no organic armor can withstand magma! As a result, the molten-hot magma melted his armor away.However, his secret, secondary defense compensated for his melted armor! His secondary defense consisted of a bubble barrier! By expelling bubbles, Body Air Magma Cars cooled the magma surrounding his body, which created a barrier of air! While that air barrier only momentarily neutralizes the magma, Cars can continuously counteract and cool the magma with his bubbles in order to continue any activity within the magma chamber! All life was borne from the crust of the Earth, but at long last, Cars the Creator has conquered the very lifeblood of the Earth! Eons ago, before the emergence of the h*m* sapiens species, an evolved hominid species had dominated the Earth.This hominid species was strictly nocturnal, as they would perish under the shine of sunlight.For this reason, they we're forced to live underground.Even without the aid of daylight, their longevity could be prolonged by hunting other organisms.When the Neanderthal species emerged, they worshipped their nocturnal counterparts either as gods or devils.The nocturnal hominids were often impervious to Death, which made reproduction a rather rare event.As a result, their population was quite limited.But their practices allowed for the establishment of a peaceful community.However a cunning outcast was created from this very community.There are prodigious powers still concealed within this shell of mine.I shall unseal these concealed powers! The cunning outcast created the Stone Mask.His creation coaxed forth his imperishable powers, but necessitated nourishment far greater than the norm.Nourishment which would leave the presence of other organisms scant.His creation would surely diminish the wildlife required for the community's survival.As a result, the community became fearful of the Stone Mask.They were fearful of the cunning outcast.His continuance shall bring about calamity! His existence must be eradicated from the Earth! k*ll the Cunning Outcast! Hear me, imbeciles! Do you not dream to walk under the daylight?! Have you no ambition to stand omnipotent over all others?! Who would dare to not triumph over Terror, itself?! Death to the Doomed.The Cunning Outcast exterminated his entire community, including the very parents who bore him.He adopted a child he had personally orphaned, and together with his compatible contemporary, left on an ambitious adventure.An adventure, which would have him hunting for a way to attain "true omnipotence." 10,000 years later, the Cunning Outcast would finally attain "true omnipotence." He is a god He is a true god! He is a god amongst men, and men cannot k*ll a god! We can only submit to his omnipotence! Come again? Sorry Jojo, but you'll have to speak up.Ripple of Repulsion! "Rip-ple?" Ripple this! Jojo! It can't be! M-Melting?! But how?! How's me leg melting?! Melting?! That could only mean that I may utilize the Ripple! You simpleton! Now that I've vanquished my vulnerabilities, I too may utilize the Art of Mystics, you incompetent "arsehole!" Th-That's impossible! From your wound, it would appear that my potency overpowers yours by a several hundred times! His powers are a several hundred times more potent?! Then it's like being struck by the Sun itself! And the Sun would easily melt away and vaporize anything, even flesh! Hurts, doesn't it? How do you like being on the receiving end? Ecstatic, from the sound of your screams.And your screams beckon me to silence you.Jojo! I'm done for Cars is coming in for the k*ll.Jojo didn't try to break from that belief.He was without fear, without pain, and without any regret, because he thought that he did all that he could do.Cars the Creator met the cold eyes of a man who lay before him, who was calmly awaiting his impending death.Stroheim shared Jojo's beliefs.Paralyzed and static from shock, he understood how a frog felt before falling prey to a python.This is the Art of Mystics My Mystic Meddler, this ceremony shall end with my ascension into Omnipotence after I've channeled Ripple energy into you! Rip-ple Potency that is far-beyond my own Melt away into the oblivion of that magma chamber! Channel it, will you?! What's this?! The Ultimate Aja?! What's this?! The Ultimate Aja?! The Ultimate Aja! At that moment, not even Jojo realized why he attempted to block Cars with the Ultimate Aja.Unconsciously, he felt an attraction between the hand holding the Ultimate Aja and Cars's Ripple.But subconsciously, Jojo's body knew the truth! Subconsciously, his body was fighting for survival! Jojo's subconsciousness empowered his survival instincts with a great shove! Th-The Ultimate Aja's actually a Ripple amplification apparatus! With that amplification of Cars's Ripple energy, the volcano's eruption occurred within an instant, and breached the bedrock! Th-That eruption blasted them both and the bedrock sky-high! Th-This is a pressure I've never experienced! But did you honestly believe that I'd let the eruption blast me away, Jojo?! I shall take to my wings to avoid entering the atmosphere! Aeternum vale, Jojo! Thank God for Gaia's Grace! The eruption blasted my bloody arm all the way up here! And now you'll ask, "Was this all a part of your plan, Jojo?!" Was this all a part-! It was at this very moment, when Cars was caught off guard by Jojo's severed arm, which would determine his doom! The volcanic ash that Cars could've avoided had struck their target, propelling him beyond the troposphere! Was this all a part of your plan, Jojo?! You bet your arse it was! I've got a plan, a scheme, a trick for every smelly pickle in the pocket! Boy, can I bluff But at least I can finally have the last laugh! Volcanic ash from the eruption blasted far-beyond the troposphere and well into the stratosphere, but even Cars couldn't be k*lled by an eruption from the Earth! However, that eruption expelled Cars beyond Earth's atmosphere and straight into outer space! Stars?! I-It cannot be! It's finally finished Nanna Erina Stroheim Great-Uncle Speedwagon Smokey and Lisa Lisa I'm out, everybody Jo JOJO!!! Eight hours later, after Stroheim was rescued from Vulcano Isle, he had only this to say to Speedwagon.February 28, 1939 An eruption off of Vulcano Isle ended Joseph Joestar's life.I've entered outer space?! If I can expel the all the steam from my abdomen in order to reverse my trajectory, I can re-enter Earth's atmosphere! I-I've failed! I-I'm freezing! O-Oxygen is being sapped from my body! The deeper into space I drift, the quicker the oxygen deprivation! I-I can't fly back! I CANNOT RETURN! Cars would never return to Planet Earth.He became an amalgamation of inorganic and organic matter, and drifted aimlessly throughout the galaxy.To the undying Creator, Death was all that he dreamt of, until one day, when every transient node in Cars's cranium ceased to function.New York City Outskirts April 1939 Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.Your kingdom come, your will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven.Goodbye, Jojo Come to think of it, we've only know each other for 'bout half-a-year.But I'll never forget you 'Til the day I die Never.Miss Erina, I think it's time we went on our way.Let us be off.Let me be Guess who?
