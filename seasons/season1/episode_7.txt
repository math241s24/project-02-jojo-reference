01x07 - The SuccessorQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:45Tibet 1863 For three years, you've done well to be disciplined in the Art of Mystics.Your reinforced Ripple respiration may carry you great distances.Only the most rigorous of Ripples remains to be taught, but I shall caution you once more, Zeppeli.Should you complete your training, your doom shall be sealed.Your course cannot be changed.You may forfeit the Art now, and lead your life anew, unbound by destruction.Lama Tong Pheti, define my destruction.Take my palm, and detail my death for me.When and where shall I succumb? Why would you want to know? I became a disciple of the Art of Mystics for the sole sake of combatting the coming evil.Should I learn the details of my death, and I shall be steeled for a short life.Only then, shall I acquiesce and acquire the final Ripple.And only then, may I be rend without regret.If so steeled, you are, for the suffering to come, then so be it! A child shall unseal an accursed chamber containing a wrathful revenant of yore.The injured lion, which is chained in this chamber, shall give way to powerful prides.Though you grant him the strength to be freed, you shall perish in a most pressing predicament.Barone Zeppeli Beware of the big bastard! Jojo, allow me to assist! The injured lion, who is chained in this chamber, shall give way to powerful prides.Sora kobore ochita futatsu no hoshi ga Once, two sh**ting stars descended from Heaven Hikari to yami noãminamo suikomareteyuku and flew straight into an ocean of emotion.From their impact, a ripple of strife exploded! hikiauyouni takanaru hamon One lead the path of pride under guidance from the Sun, hokori no michi wo yukumono ni taiyou no michibiki wo while the other strove for unbound ambition yabou no hate wo mezasu mono ni no matter the cost.ikenie wo furueru hodo kokoro moetsukiru hodo atsuku The star of the Sun, unwavering, burning with vigor, sono te kara hanate kodou radiates a courageous flame engulfing its entire being! karada minagiru yuuki de mayoi naki kakugo ni gassai wo Both stars ready to collide sono chi no sadame jojo For it's in the blood of all JoJos!

Yo-You don't need Leave me here, and go defeat Dio Destroy the stone mask Barone! Brief as my life was, I regret nothing.I was once married, and even had a family.But I left them, in pursuit of the stone mask.I knew I had done wrong, and yet I regret nothing.I embraced my fate of a short life Now, I've shared with you both my story.But Jojo.You are my only hope for humanity! Barone To me, you are a dear friend and beloved son.I'll always be with you.Now, and forever.Cia-! In the 19th Century, there was an English novelist known as William M.Thackeray who once said, "To love and win is the best thing, to love and lose is the next best." Jojo had lost his master, but he gained Zeppeli's story and spirit.Rest in peace, Barone Zeppeli.I-I beg of you! Please, spare my child's life! So if I may, Madam, allow me to clarify your request.You would willingly join my horde, on the condition that I spare the child.Is that correct? Please, just spare my baby boy! No more tears, please.How touching.Very well.Neither I nor my horde shall harm your child.I'll cross my heart, even.I must note though, Madam, my loyal servants surrendered their mortality to me in exchange for immortality, but would you not want your child to have to same? You both would be together, forever, without any mortal quarrel for all eternity.Please, just spare my baby boy! Spare him! Have it your way.My beautiful baby boy! I kept my word, Madam, but perhaps you should've chosen yours better.Now, your beautiful baby became your banquet.Mr.Joestar's wearing a solemn scowl now.His emotions are eclipsed in that shadow.We're all in the same boat.We're all trying to keep our emotions bottled up.But only after we've defeated Dio can we cry and curse! Mr.Joestar.Dio said that he'd transform all of Wind Knight's Road within the span of a night.If his zombies start infecting others, we'll have a plague to oppose.Is the township safe? Is anyone even alive in Wind Knight's Road? I hope Peggy and the others are okay We make haste! Mr.Adams! Poco, just what in God's name are you doing out so late?! Mr.Adams, have you seen Peggy? A-Are the town and its people okay?! "Okay?" It's pretty far from "okay!" It's bollocks! I got locked in yer barn after breaking my back all day! I suppose the township is still safe.Then we have to hurry! Thank you, Mr.Adams! Wee children I love the warm blood of wee children! He's already been turned! Catch me if you can!

For disciples of Mystics, greetings require no contact.This is our greeting.If I may, might I inquire Zeppeli's whereabouts? So, Zeppeli has already embraced his fate.Were we to have arrived sooner, his fate would've still been the same.Tell me, is this "Dio" so overwhelming a foe to face?
