04x06 - Moody Blues' Counterattack / Moody Jazz's CounterattackQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/24/23 09:17Nar: Leone Abbacchio became a police officer after graduating from high school.Nar: This was due to his strong sense of justice.Nar: But soon after he became a police officer, his lifelong dream,Nar: Abbacchio realized there were many contradictions that came with this job.Nar: The police were supposed to risk their lives to save others,Nar: while those very people they were risking their lives to protectNar: were the ones who were stealing, injuring others in hit-and-runs,Abba: Hey, you two!Nar: and throwing rocks at police cars, breaking their windshields.Guy: Honey!Abba: Are you all right?Guy: Hey, you!Guy: You're a cop, aren't you?!Nar: The masses were unappreciative,Nar: demanding, and irresponsibly discredited and insulted the police,Nar: asking, "What are the police even doing?!"Nar: Even if the police risked their lives to arrest criminals who were lower than scum,Sign: "Serial Burglar Isacco Finally Arrested!"Sign: "A Whole Group Wiped Out"Nar: the law for the masses was rather lenient as long as they had money,Sign: "Isacco Releasedon  Million Lire" "Victims Furious"Nar: and they would be released.Guy: Quit causing us so much trouble.Isacco: My bad.Guy: It doesn't matter now.Guy: We just have to find more people to rip off.Nar: Eventually, Abbacchio started to learn from these contradictions.Pimp: Come on, Officer.Pimp: Cut us some slack.Pimp: That girl's father is swimming in debt, so she needs the cash.Pimp: It's not like we're hurting anyone.Girl: Hey, are you done yet?Girl: I've got a client waiting.Pimp: I know, I know.Abba: Even if I were to arrest them, they'd just post bail and be released.Abba: The only difference is they pay either me or the court and their lawyers.Pimp: You're a very passionate man,Pimp: and a very passionate police officer.Nar: One night, they received a report that a shop was being robbed.Guy: Abbacchio! Go around the back.Abba: Freeze! You're under arrest!Pimp: H-Hey, it's you.Pimp: Looks like I messed up.Abba: You're...Guy: He's been sh*t in the head.Pimp: Hey, couldn't you just pretend that you didn't see me?Pimp: Come on, let me go.Pimp: I won't cause you any more trouble.Abba: No! You're under arrest!Pimp: Come on, think this through...Pimp: If I get arrested, the fact that you took a bribe from me will get out, too.Pimp: That g*n's really dangerous...Pimp: Could you point it somewhere else?Guy: Abbacchio! He has a g*n!Pimp: Ow! It hurts, God damn it!Pimp: I'm gonna die...Pimp: I'm gonna die...Pimp: I'm gonna die...Pimp: I'm really gonna die...Nar: That moment was the end of Abbacchio's future.Nar: Not only was he charged for being a dirty cop,Nar: but he allowed his partner todie because of his actions,Nar: and that was a cross he'd have to bear for the rest of his life.Nar: It was then that his body and soul plunged into darkness.Nar: No matter who d*ed, or even if he lost a limb or two,Nar: his heart would probably never be moved again.Bruno: Abbacchio, wasn't it?JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio   Moody Jazz's CounterattackGio: You can solve the mystery, right?Gio: I'm counting on you!Bruno: Giorno!Bruno: What the hell are you doing?!Sfx: RoarBruno: G-Giorno!Bruno: Giorno's in trouble!Abba: Giorno Giovanna...Abba: You're one crazy bastard.Abba: All this to prove yourself...Abba: What the hell is wrong with you?Gio: Y-You bastard...Gio: Th-This Stand...Bruno: Use your Golden Wind to defend yourself!Bruno: I-Impossible!Bruno: Giorno... Where are you?!Abba: Don't go down there, Bucciarati.Abba: Actually, stay back.Abba: It's not that I trust Giorno Giovanna as one of us,Abba: but Giorno seems to believe that you won't abandon him.Abba: He does some pretty crazy sh*t.Abba: Giorno Giovanna...Abba: What if that had actually k*lled you?Abba: So, again, Bucciarati, don't go down there.Bruno: Th-That fly...Bruno: Narancia's shoe...Bruno: Giorno's powers haven't disappeared yet.Bruno: Does that mean Giorno's alive?Abba: They're here, Bucciarati!Abba: Narancia and the enemy are below deck!Bruno: Zipper Man!Bruno: Narancia, Fugo, Mista, and Giorno aren't here!Abba: Maybe they're right under where the fly is.Bruno: It's just like Giorno said.Bruno: The enemy's not just hiding in some locker or behind something to att*ck...Abba: Hey. The fly's coming around now.Bruno: That's strange...Bruno: Where is the enemy going?Bruno: How and where is the enemy hiding?Abba: Regarding this enemy's abilities...Abba: I hate to admit it, but it looks like I'll have to accept what Giorno was saying.Abba: I'll use my Stand to solve this mystery!Abba: But... This spot's bad news, Bucciarati!Abba: Moody Jazz!Abba: Does Narancia from five minutes ago work?Bruno: Yeah. That should be fine.Abba: Is the fly all right?Bruno: It's heading toward the bow.Bruno: Now's our chance. Do it quickly.Abba: Yeah.Bruno: What's that noise?Abba: His headphones.Abba: Five minutes ago, Narancia was listening to his boombox.Nara: Huh? What's wrong with this thing?It just stopped working!Nara: Why'd it stop?Bruno: This isn't it.Nara: I just bought it!Bruno: Narancia was att*cked a little after this.Nara: Damn it! How dare he sell me something like this?!Abba: I'll try fast forwarding and searching.Nara: That stupid old guy from the electronics store is gonna regret this!Bruno: That ten billion now belongs to us!Bruno: With that money, we can claim the rank of capo!Nara: A-Awesome!Nara: Where is it?Bruno: That was my voice.Nara: Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?Bruno: It was right after this conversation that Narancia was att*cked!Bruno bg: I can't tell you that yet.Bruno: We'd better be able to see just how he was att*cked, Abbacchio.abba: My Stand replays everything.abba: We'll be able to see everything, from Narancia's sweat to his pulse.Abba: And it'll follow him everywhere.Bruno: It's about time.Bruno: Let's get behind Narancia.Bruno: He's about to be att*cked!Bruno: L-Look! It's the same wound Giorno had!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HFA&\c&HBAA&}Roar!Bruno: It's coming!Bruno: Th-This is...Bruno: He's deflating like a balloon losing air!Sign top: Mario ZuccheroSign bot: Tender MachineBruno: Air is leaking from his wound, deflating him.Abba: Looks like we know what the enemy's abilities are now.Bruno: He's being pulled in!Bruno: Pause it, Abbacchio!Bruno: I see... So he's inside the pipe.Bruno: This is the answer to our mystery.Bruno: His nails, flesh, and bones are all floppy like a condom,Bruno: even his shoe and his belt buckle,Bruno: but he still has a pulse.Bruno: Just like Giorno said, he's alive.Bruno: So that's what's going on...Bruno: The enemy is also doing this to his own body,Bruno: hiding in pipes or between the planks or walls,Bruno: and he's dragged in Mista, Fugo, and Giorno, as well.Bruno: That explains why Giorno's fly can trace the general area,Bruno: but can't pinpoint exactly where they are.Abba: We figured out the enemy's ability.Abba: Now all we have to do is chase the enemy,Abba: find out where Narancia and the others are and save them,Abba: and then b*at the sh*t out of the guy.Abba: I'm resuming Moody Jazz's replay.Bruno: Chase? Wait a second, Abbacchio!Bruno: While you're replaying, you can't att*ck or defend yourself. You're totally defenseless!Bruno: It's dangerous to go into the pipe.Abba: I know exactly where Moody Jazz is going.Abba: When that bastard is near, use your zippers to open the floor and get him!Abba: We can't defeat the enemy if we don't chase him, Bucciarati!Abba: It went left.Abba: That's where he got Mista.Abba: Moody Jazz is going right underneath that ring buoy.Abba: It's going around toward the cabin where it got Fugo and Giorno.Bruno: So the enemy is moving them around while keeping them captured.Abba: It's moving much slower...Abba: That's where the bastard was hiding earlier.Abba: On the inside of that rope fastener!Abba: The enemy's right below the deck there!Bruno: The enemy's coming for us.Bruno: I'm not sure if he knows that we know his ability, but...Abba: Bring it on!Abba: The pipes! Cut through them and get them outta there!Bruno: Zipper Man!Bruno: Th-They're not there!Bruno: Where's the enemy, Abbacchio?Bruno: Where's your Moody Jazz? Where are they?Abba: Right there.Abba: It's my Stand. I know where it is.Abba: It's right around there.Bruno: Right around where?Abba: I'm telling you, right where you opened up!Abba: My Moody Jazz is definitely right there!Bruno: Where are they?Abba: Where are they?Abba: Impossible... It's definitely right here.Abba: Does this mean there's a mystery we haven't solved yet?Bruno: This isn't good!Bruno: Undo the replay and call your Stand back!Abba: I already did.Abba: Something's wrong...Abba: What wall is this?Abba: Where the hell are you?Abba: Did you hear that, Bucciarati?Abba: That's the sound of the inside of a pipe.Abba: We can't see it, but Moody Jazz is definitely right there...Abba: inside the pipe.Bruno: What are you doing?Bruno: The enemy's right there!Abba: The pipe's wide open, but it's in the pipe...Bruno: It's coming closer...Abba: So it's right here...Bruno: We need to run!Abba: Run?Abba: That Giorno Giovanna, whom I hate, told me to solve this mystery.Abba: He's an annoying little brat,Abba: but I'm going to solve it!Bruno: Abbacchio...Bruno: It's coming!Abba: There's one more mystery surrounding this enemy.Abba: I'm finally starting to see it.Abba: I'll solve this and k*ll that bastard!Abba: That awkward feeling I got when I saw the mast...Abba: Back then...Bzzzzzz,Sfx: B{\c&HCDE&}zzz{\c&HAADA&}zzzBruno: It's right there! Call back your Stand!Abba: I've figured out the other mystery!Bruno: Abbacchio...Abba: k*ll him... Bucciarati!Abba: This mystery...Abba: The place the enemy's hiding...Bruno: You're being dragged in! Grab on to me!Bruno: Damn it!Bruno: He's not there...Bruno: Where did he go?Bruno: What?Bruno: You bastard...Bruno: Where did you take Abbacchio?!Bruno: He's not in the cabin or the drainage pipe...Bruno: Where are you hiding Abbacchio and the others?!Mario: The fact that there are seagulls flying around...Mario: must mean we're getting close to shore.Mario: Looks like you're finally all alone, Bucciarati.Bruno: You bas—Mario: Oh, hang on one sec.Mario: Ah, ah, ah!Mario: I'm the one who's gonna do the talking here.Mario: Shut your trap until I tell you to answer my questions, damn it!Mario: Very good.Mario: I can finish you off at any time, and your crew is still alive,Mario: but in suspended animation.JoJo-main: ,You should be grateful.Mario: I could've k*lled them and thrown them into the sea,Mario: all chopped up nicely so the fishies could eat them easier.Mario: Depending on your actions, I may even consider turning your crew back to normal.Mario: All you have to do is tell me where Polpo's secret fortune is!Bruno: Are you from Passione?Mario: You really...Mario: don't get it at all.Mario: I'll m*rder you, you little sh*t!Mario: Listen up! All you're allowed to say is where the money is!Mario: Just try and utter any other word from that assh*le of a mouth!Mario: For every word you say, I'll k*ll one of your friends!Mario: Say, "What?" and I'll k*ll them!Mario: Stay silent, and I'll k*ll them!Mario: If I find out you're lying later, I'll k*ll them again!Mario: Got it?Mario: Speak cautiously and very carefully.Mario: Now, then, let me ask you...Mario: Where's the money hidden?Bruno: Black-tailed gulls.Mario: Sorry, where?Bruno: Those aren't seagulls.Bruno: They're black-tailed gulls.Bruno: How do you tell them apart?Bruno: The ones that sound like they're meowing are black-tailed gulls.Bruno: You called them seagulls, but you were wrong.Bruno: They're black-tailed gulls.Mario: I'm gonna k*ll one now!Bruno: Just try it! Better hope youdon't get dragged down!Mario: Wh-What the hell are you doing?!Bruno: I didn't punch the deck earlier to find where Abbacchio was.Bruno: It was to put a hole in the bottom of the boat.Mario: A h-hole?!Bruno: Abbacchio figured out where you were,Bruno: and he was kind enough to show me...Bruno: where you are and how to know for sure.Bruno: It was Abbacchio's blood.Bruno: Abbacchio intentionally hurt his hand and showed me the blood trail.Bruno: The blood trail didn't go down below the deck!Bruno: It was cut off right on the deck!Bruno: So what does that mean, and where was he dragged to?Bruno: I rented the yacht that was on the left.Bruno: Abbacchio realized that when he looked up at the sky.Bruno: I know where you are, so if you don't wanna drown,Bruno: you'd best come out.Bruno: There were two boats!Baaaaaa,Sfx: BwaaaaaMario: You bastard...Bruno: You were hiding by thinly covering this yacht with another one.Bruno: You were traveling through the thin gap between them and attacking us from there.Bruno: No wonder we couldn't figure it out. You get points for that.Mario: Stay back, Bucciarati!Mario: I'll k*ll your friends!Bruno: You should know better than anyone thatBruno: you couldn't survive in a g*ng if a measly little thr*at like that scared you.Bruno: Give up, and I'll forgive you.Bruno: But the moment you s*ab Abbacchio...Bruno: I will end your life.Fwip,Sfx: FwipBruno: It's just as Giorno said.Bruno: The fact that you had to hide to att*ck is your weakness.Bruno: You're way too slow.Pop,Sfx: PopBruno: Abbacchio!Abba: Well done...Bruno: Abbacchio,Bruno: what's important isn't the end result.Bruno: It's how you get there.Bruno: Join my team.Bruno: Don't die bound by your past.
