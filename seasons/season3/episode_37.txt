Now, Hol Horse,Mondatta instructed,  stick your fingers upPolnareff's nose, and then  We did it! They're out coldfrom losing all that blood!  Lucky you, Hol Horse!  This is your chanceto finish them off!  So, when the hellis this chance coming?   What am I supposed to do now?    What the hell are you doing, Hol Horse?   That's what I'd like to know!   What's wrong, Polnareff?   sh*t! They're headed this way!   Damn it!   How do I make the rest ofthe prediction come true now?   Polnareff, did you find outwho was tailing us?   Answer me.   Avdol and the others are coming.   This is bad, really bad!   Chariot!   Whoa, hold it right there!   This is bad!   I'm the fastest sh**tyou'll ever meet.   Don't move or you're a dead man!   Hey, Polnareff, was that you?   Polnareff!   Oh, there you are.   What's the matter?   Was someone following us?   Er...   Damn it! I'm cornered.   I thought I was supposedto get my big chance   after I stuck my fingers upPolnareff's nose!   I'm in a whole lotta trouble!    Something wrong, Polnareff?    No.   If Avdol finds out I'm here,I'm a goner!   I think I'm gonna cry.   If I knew this was going to happen,   I would've just blown him awayfrom a distance!   Dammit, Mondatta!   I was faster than Polnareff, but...   Crap!   Polnareff?   Tell them to scram!   If they catch me,you're going down with me, Polnareff.   No one was following us.   Guess it was just my imagination.   I see.   And what are you doingstanding there like that?   Tell them you were taking a leak.You were pissing!   Oh, you know just taking a wizz.   What?   You were peeingin the middle of the street?   You amaze me sometimes.   Stop jabbing that g*n into my head!   That's it!I'll make a little gesture.   God I hope they figure it out.   Look where my tongue is pointing!   I'm trying to give you a sign!Behind me!   Behind me, damn it! Behind me!   Why are they being so quiet?   Ah, well. You guys go on ahead.   All right.   I was lying!   It was a lie! Don't leave me!   Look at my tongue. Behind me!   Behind me, damn it!Come on, just look!   What's wrong?   Why are you making that face?   Does your tongue hurt?   No, he's signalingsomething's behind.   You idiot! Shut up!   You don't mean...   Polnareff!   You son of a...   You were signalingsomething to them!   That's it! You've pissed me offfor the last time!   Die!   What?   -Huh?-It's him!   What the hell? He sneezed?   It's Hol Horse! Watch out!   He's got a friend hidingunder the crate!   Blast it! This can't be happening.   He sneezed because I jammedmy fingers up his nose!   Damn! If he hadn't sneezed,   I could've at leastgotten Polnareff.   I should've neverteamed up with you, Mondatta!   They're gonna k*ll me!   It's all because ofthat blasted premonition!   I'm doomed!   Brother, look! Look who's there!   That's him, all right.   It's the bastardwho blew off my ear at the airport.   I'll run him over!   What?   This is...    It all happened so fast.    They had no time to stopthe truck with their Stands    I stuck my fingers up his nose,and the prediction came true.    I can't believe it.All four of them at once!    It's fate, yes.    My premonitions are always right.    But it's too soon to finish them.    We must wait forthe next prediction, yes.    Okay!    EMPERORHOL HORSE    “We did it!”, they proclaimed.    The chance to finish offtheir enemies had arrived!    But be careful, you two.    Don't rush in. Hide and wait.    It's still too soon to move in.    Three of them are knocked out,but Jotaro's still conscious.    He's about to get up!    Jotaro wasn't hit directly.    That was a close one.    If we had crept up to him,he could've att*cked us.    He's looking for me.    He's wondering why I split    instead of blowinghis head straight off.    We're gonna b*at 'em right,Mondatta?    We've made it this far.I have to win whatever it takes.    You're with me right, Mondatta?    Yeah.    We're almost there.    So Mondatta, what do we gotta do nextto k*ll these guys?    Your comic's predictionsare    % accurate.    I believe you!    I'll do whatever I have to.    If it tells me to stick my fingersup something, I'll do it.    If it tells me to eat crap,I'll eat it.    I have to win!    There... it is!    It finally appeared, yes.    -The final prediction!-What?    Here we go! Hol Horse'snext att*ck will be his last!    Hol Horse came acrosstwo plumbers repairing drainpipes.    Then he paid themto open one of the pipes.    If Hol Horse firesall of his b*ll*ts into that pipe    at exactly twelve noon...    Hey, looks like there wasa car accident around the corner.    Who cares? Let's finish this thing.    Here, hold this pipe.    Okay.    What happensif I fire into the pipe?    Come on! Turn the page!    I fire my g*n into the pipeand then what?    And the b*ll*ts flew outthe other end!    Ka-boom! Hol Horse's b*ll*tswent right through Jotaro's skull!    Right smack in the middleof his forehead!    Yes!    This is it, yes!    I've been waiting for this, yes.    This is whatI've been waiting for, yes.    That's great!    I mean, it looks great,but hold on a sec!    What if we read it wrong?Then we're toast!    Look at this page.    This is the predictionfrom when your brother    tried to wipe out Jotaro.    But your brother was the onewho got blown up!    That's because my brothertransformed himself into Jotaro    without thinking, yes.    But you and I cannottransform ourselves, yes.    That's right!I don't have any disguise powers!    I couldn't even pretendto be Jotaro.    Does that mean...    It does! Yes.    I can avenge my brother! Yes!    There's no way to misinterpretthis prophecy, yes.    If you sh**t your b*ll*tsinto this pipe,    Jotaro will die!    Yes!    But wait.    It said a time.    At the stroke of noon, wasn't it?    Wait, twelve o'clock sharp?    We have two minutes!    Don't panic.    All you have to do is aim your g*ninto the pipe and fire, yes.    You have plenty of time, yes.    It's fate.It will happen.    I know. It's    %!    I believe you. I believe you, but...    I'm under the g*n.    I gotta hustle!    Hey, you guys! Listen up.    Open that pipe!    Just do it!    Hey, who do you thinkyou're talking to?    Who the hell do you think you are?    You wanna die!Hurry the hell up and open it!    Hol Horse, ordinary peoplecannot see your Stand, yes.    The comic saysyou pay them, yes.    Huh? Pay them?    Now only one minuteten seconds left!    Okay, I'll pay you!    All right! I'm sorry!I'll pay you to open it!    Please! Just open it!    Pay us? What a weirdo.    You'll pay usjust to open the pipe?    Then sure. Hand it over!    Right.    Hey, what's the problem?    I don't have any money!    That's right!I left my wallet at the hotel.    Who is this guy?    Mondatta!    Remember, if you got lost?I gave you some change just in case.    Give it to me. Hurry!    Yes.    We've got    seconds. Faster!    Here's your change purse.There's a lot of money.    Hey, one rolled behind the bricks.    It's just coins,but there's a lot of them.    How much you think there is?    Looks like maybe    pounds!Hey, you're stepping on one.    -Oh, you're right.-Pick the damn coins up later!    You can have it all!    Here you go, boys.It's almost noon.    I made you some tea.    Take a load offand have some lunch.    Oh, sounds good to me.    Listen, granny! I was here first!Now scram!    Thanks, ma'am.    You sons of!I said hurry up and open it!    Or I'll cr*ck your heads openwith this rock!    Okay, it's open.    Out of the way!    Die, Jotaro!    I did it!Just like the prediction said!    I sh*t 'em at the stroke of noon!    Go get him!    Wake up, old man.    I think I'll be okay.    Me too.Just minor cuts and bruises.    But Polnareff is...    Someone get this damn blockoff of me.    I won!    He's right in front of the pipe!    What?    Hey, hey.    Sorry, Jotaro.    I don't knowwhat Hol Horse was thinking,    but he stuck his fingersright up my nose.    The guy's disgusting.    It still itches. Sorry.    My b*ll*ts!    They missed!    Mondatta!What are you trying to pull?    What the hell is going on?    I don't know, yes.    My predictions are always true!It's fate!    I can't believe it!    My predictions have neverever been wrong, yes!    Look! Jotaro and the othersare still alive.    Not one b*llet hit any of them!    The prediction was totally wrong!    You little...    Tune in next time.    Now for the twelve o'clock news...    Huh?    What? It's noon now?    My watch!    It's fast!    That means I firedthe b*ll*ts too soon.    It's exactly noon!    What's gonna happen?    What's gonna happen now?    It can't be...    The prediction said the b*ll*ts would goright through Jotaro's forehead    at the stroke of noon.    Hol Horse, the b*ll*ts are...    What's gonna happen next?    Hey, did you hear that?I thought I heard someone scream.    I don't know what's going on,but something's fishy.    This truck.    Let's get out of herebefore the cops show up.    What the hell happenedto Hol Horse, anyway?    I don't know.    He disappeared for some reason.    Careful, Jotaro. Get awayfrom that pipe before you get soaked.    Is he dead?    No, but he's critical.    I have no idea what happened,    but looks like a b*lletwent through his forehead    and out the top of his head.    One centimeter lower,and he would have been a goner.    He's a very lucky man.    My prediction was correct.    And this was Hol Horse's fate.    But that Jotaro,    how lucky can he be?    Both my brother and Hol Horselost to fate.    Master Dio is the only onewho can defeat him.    Zenyatta,    Hol Horse taught methat revenge is just a big joke.    I'm going to forget about Jotaro.    From now on, I'm going to usemy prophetic powers    for our happinessand for the happiness of others.    Maybe people will start to like us.    Maybe our futurewill be a little brighter.    I'm sick of spending my lifecowering under a box,    afraid of everyone.    I learned a lot from this battle.    I'm coming home, Brother.    I'm coming home to Aswan,to join you.    Sorry.I kicked it without thinking.    I didn't mean to hit you.    Forgive me.    Wait, this dog...    I think I've seen him before,but where?    This dog!It couldn't be!    No!    Hey, by the way,where'd that dumbass dog go?    Iggy?    I'm sure he's scroungingfor food somewhere.    I told youthat he wouldn't help us.    If people could change that easily,life wouldn't be so hard.    Sure enough, Mondatta joinedHol Horse in the hospital,    meeker than ever.    Ba-dum-tss!    Iggy hates being with others.    I was looking for youbecause I have a request.    No doubt about it.It's this mansion.    By the way, where'd Iggy go?    Good grief. I can't let a kidwho likes dogs die.
