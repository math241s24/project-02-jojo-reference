I know exactlywhere each of you landed.  Four... Five steps.  You're walking ever so quietly.  But I hear you.   These "steps" musthave thrown him.   Cursed water Stand!Go ahead and att*ck.   I'll vaporize youwith Magician's Red   the moment you show yourself.    EPISODE   :IGGY THE FOOL AND GEB'S N'DOUL, PART     He's here!   Wait. Why did he takeonly five steps?   Why has he stopped moving?   Now!   Magician's Red!   What?   What--   Avdol...   He's so...   So quick...   Avdol!   Ingenious indeed.   I must pay more attentionto their vibrations.   Those weren't footsteps.   It seems he threwring-like objects.   And these burns...   It must have been Avdol.   But he'll be a problem no longer.   Good bye...   -It's back!-It's back!   Avdol!   Hmm... someone is running now.   I don't believe it!Jotaro's running?   His stride tells mehe is about    ...   No,     centimeters tall.   He has a youthfulness to him.He's not Joseph.   It must be Jotaro.   But where is he running?   It dove in!   The water's after Jotaro!   So it's come to this.   It stopped attacking Avdol, but...   Jotaro! He's catching up!   I hear of all our enemies' Stands,   Jotaro's Star Platinum isby far the fiercest.   Master Dio will be delightedif I m*rder him.   With every fiber of my being,for Master Dio,   I shall defeat Jotaro!   Jotaro just picked something upoff the sand.   What was at that location?   What was it...   No, it's not inanimate!   It's the dog!Jotaro grabbed the dog.   He knows!   So that's your game.   You jumped out of the carbefore it was att*cked!   You can smell it! You know wherethe Stand's coming from!   Don't stop, Jotaro!   Time to earn your keep, Iggy.   Where's it coming from?Spill it, Iggy!   Or else we die together.   You won't get any gumfrom me, either.   Iggy!   He can fly?   Not so fast!   Go ahead, pant all you want.You're not getting out of this one.   My Star Platinum is fast.   You let me go,and I'll snap your neck.   What? He jumped and then nothing.   They haven't landed anywhere.   Impossible...   That's brilliant!   Jotaro's using Iggyto find the Stand user!   If we can find whoever'scontrolling the Stand,   we might actually havea chance of defeating him!   He's gone...   I can't hear Jotaro's footsteps.   Where is he? Where did he go?   Why can't I hear his footsteps?   They're flying lower and lower...   Looks like The Fool can't flylong distances.   It's gliding like a paper airplane!   My legs are about totouch the ground.   Hey, quit tensing up like that.   You're farting again.   You'd better notlet loose a big one.   I guess I have no choice.   Time to get a little more air.   That brought us a lot closer,   but the sound of that kickjust sent us back some.   Now he'll know we're flying.   So that's it! The dog's Stand...   can fly.   And they're...   heading this way!    I must k*ll Jotaro beforehe gets any closer!    His Stand is going after Jotaro!    He figured it out whenJotaro struck the ground!    All we can do now is trust Jotaro.    He's getting closer.    Sure, he was able tobring down a copter,    but he won't findour exact location.    Iggy's Stand makes barely a sound.    If I can just find the Stand userbefore touching the sand,    it'll be lights out for good!    Found him!    The Stand user's about    meters away!    Seems our enemy is blind.    It's sand!Sand's falling from the sky!    That's why he's hurling sandinto the air!    Not good!    He's locating us by listening tothe sand bounce off the wings.    Just like a submarine uses sonar!    I can hear you... I can hearthe sand bouncing off you.    I've found your coordinates.I know your altitude...    Jotaro!    GEBN'DOUL    sh**t him!    Star Platinum!    Star Platinum's speedmeans nothing.    If you can't determinemy direction of att*ck,    my Stand has the advantage!    Here comes another!    Iggy...    You damn dog...    That dog is dragging Jotaroright into my Stand's grasp!    It'll do anythingto save his own hide.    Even abandon his master!    Bastard...    -You little piece of...-Iggy...    That's what you get for relying onsuch a fickle creature, Jotaro.    The end has finally come.    Now, to put an end to your misery...    What? He's thrown something at me!    This wind shear...    What was it?    It's Iggy.    Come on, now.    You'd better use your Standsto defend yourselves,    or you'll both end up one big mess.    Such incredible velocity...    Damn! It's going to crash into me!    I can't believe it!He threw the dog...    Blast it! I was so closeto finishing Jotaro...    No!    I lost Jotaro's locationbecause of that damn dog!    Where is he?    He's not moving...    He's staying absolutely still.    This must be part of his plan!    Where are you, Jotaro?    Where? Show yourself, Jotaro.    Right here.    I see...    I didn't realizeyou had slinked so close.    If I hadn't protected myselfwith this water shield,    you would have alreadystruck me from behind.    I suppose I no longer needthis cane to hear you.    But I'll need itwhen I return home.    Iggy...    You knocked off my hat.    You know, I kept that hat oneven when I was scuba diving.    Don't worry. I went easy on you.    You'll live.    What? You used your own Stand to...    Why did you do it?    You thought you couldget me to talk...    tell you about the othereight Stand users, didn't you?    I know Joseph Joestar'sHermit Purple    can read people's minds.    I'll never tell you anything...    anything that you coulduse against him.    Dio...    Why are you all so loyal to him?    So loyal that you'd die...    Jotaro, I do not fear death.    My Stand has always enabled me    to live life unfetteredby a fear of death.    I could win any fight.    I could have and do whateverI wanted. No one could stop me.    k*lling, stealing...it meant nothing to me.    I'm sure that muttknows how I feel.    He was the first and only person    to instill in me a desire to live.    He was so strong, so wise,so beautiful.    He was the only one who sawa purpose to my existence.    I waited so long to meet him.    I will gladly die, but...    I will not disappoint him.    Evil needs an evil savior.    I'll tell you just one thing.    My name is N'doul.    My Stand hails from Egypt,birthplace of the Tarot.    One of the great Ennead,the nine gods of Egypt...    It is called Geb, god of Earth.    The nine Egyptian gods?    What do you mean?    I will tell you aboutmy Stand only...    After all, you are the onewho defeated me.    The rest stays with me...    Dio is like some charismaticcult leader...    Just who is he?    And the nine gods of Egypt?    It's all a mystery.    But we have to continue onward.    Hey, no need to be defensive.I'm not mad or anything.    I doubt you wanted to be    dragged out into the desertand forced into some human fight.    Guess I don't blame youfor being pissed.    Here, Iggy. Want some gum?    Calm down. I said I'm sorry.    Here.    Good grief.That dog's a pain in the ass.    Stay out here in the middle ofthe desert for all I care.    Iggy...    Well, what do you know.You picked up my hat for me?    Maybe you're not so bad.    Thanks.    Gum. Damn mutt...    You're no ordinary pooch.    Hey!    Jotaro!    Jotaro! Are you all right?    Good grief.    Oh? Is that a comic book?    Never seen one here before!    So Egyptians read comics, too?    Want some mini-donuts?     TASTY DONUTS    Hey... Um, can I see that?    I'm a comic book artist searchingfor inspiration.    I love rare books and comics.    Here, I'll let you usemy binoculars.    What's this? "Zenyatta MondattaBrothers Adventure."    I don't see the author's nameanywhere...    Wow.    Such weird pictures.    Great print quality,and in full color!    There once lived two brotherswho got along very well.    "My name is Zenyatta."    "My name is Mondatta."    Mondatta, the younger brother,was very shy    and wouldn't do anythingwithout Zenyatta.    He was always alone.    One day, while his big brother,Zenyatta, was away,    Mondatta met a very kind traveler.    The traveler gave Mondattayummy snacks,    and let Mondattalook through his binoculars.    Mondatta had so much fun.    "Oh, it's   :  !"    But the very kind traveler...    was impaled on a telephone poleand d*ed.    What a weird comic.    Is this comic popular here?    This book is so weird.    The rest of the pagesare all blank.    Nothing's printed...    Must be defective.    Somehow this comic hastotally pulled me in.    I know this sounds crazy,but could I buy this book from you?    -It's not for sale.-Huh?    My brother's book isn't for sale!    Now get lost.    Brother?    Didn't you hear me?    I told you not totalk to strangers.    There are lots of bad peopleout there, ya know.    Last call! The bus for Aswanis about to depart!    Let's go.    I heard they're heading    to the hospital in Aswanto drop off their friend.    I see...    I guess we can't domuch about that.    Then we'll have to waitfor the next bus.    We are unstoppable brothers!    Who's there?    It's me, Polnareff.    Jotaro, what happenedto your uniform?    You're acting weird today.    Could it possibly be that you're...    -Could it be...-Could it be...    Zenyatta, the predictionsare absolute.    Do your best!
