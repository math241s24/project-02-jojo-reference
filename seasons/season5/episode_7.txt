And this!Fugo: Seriously! Who do you think you are?!Abba: You bastard!Gio: Hey, something fell off him.Gio: Let's see...Gio: Mario Zucchero. His home address is in Rome.Gio: So he's a gangster from Rome.Mist: So is that thing on your face garbage?Mist: Or is it a piece of seaweed?Mist: It looks like it could be seaweed, but it also looks like it could be a piece of plastic.Mist: It'd break my heart if it's actually garbage,Mist: because it'd mean that this beautiful ocean is polluted.Mist: Mind if I take a closer look at it?Mist: Hey.Mist: I asked you if you'd mind if I took a closer look at that.Mist: Answer me when I ask you a question, would you?Nar: Capri.Nar: When the ancient Greeks colonized various lands in the Mediterranean Sea,Nar: they looked for places with the most beautiful scenery in the world.Nar: One of those locations happened to be Capri.Nar: Its blue sea, its sparkling sky...Nar: But in sharp contrast, it also had a shorelineJoJo-internal/narrator: ,made up of white precipices, making it look like a fortress.Nar: During the age of the Roman Empire, there was an emperor who madeJoJo-internal/narrator: ,this island his vacation home and didn't return to Rome for ten years.Nar: Bruno Bucciarati and his crew are about to land on this islandJoJo-internal/narrator: ,in order to claim Polpo's secret fortune of ten billion lire.JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio  Six b*ll*ts Appears, Part Gio: Bucciarati, let's start to make a course toward land.Gio: I've been looking for a while now, but there isn't a single boat following us.Gio: No one should know that this boat is heading to Capri.Bruno: Yeah, there are no boats, but...Bruno: The problem is whoever that guy heard about the secret fortune from.Bruno: I have a hard time believing he followed us on his own.Mista: You seem very interested in these, but they're not mine.JoJo-main: ,They were inside the boat.Mista: Which would you prefer me to use?JoJo-main: ,The glasses or the fishing line?Mista: We need some answers from you.Mista: If we don't get some, we'll be in danger.Mista: You have a partner, don't you, Mr. Zucchero?Mista: And they're also a Stand user, aren't they?Mista: That's why I'll be using these.Mista: You don't even want to bother telling me which one you'd like me to use?Mista: If you won't pick one...Mista: I'll just have to use both!Mista: Well? Do you feel like talking now?Nara: Ma-ri-o Zuc-che-ro. Heaven, Hell, or the th Circle of Hell...Nara: Heaven, Hell, or...Nara: The th Circle of Hell!Nara: He's headed for the th Circle of Hell, according to this name divination!Mista: If you're not going to tell us the name ofJoJo-main: ,your partner who's coming after us and their Stand ability...Mista: You should probably start worrying about your other eye, Mr. Zucchero!Abba: Quit playing around, you dumbasses.Abba: Damn it, come here and look at this.JoJo-main: ,He was using the radio on the boat.Bruno: Sounds like you found something with Moody Jazz's replay.Bruno: Let's have a look.Abba: This whole boat was flat, but we'll be able to see himJoJo-main: ,in -D now that it's back to normal.Abba: Giorno!JoJo-main: ,I have no intention of showing you my Stand!JoJo-main: ,Turn around.Abba: I'll do you a favor and let you hear its voice, at least.Abba: When I was watching the replay of him, he started using the boat's radio.Abba: He's contacting someone.mario: I've already made four of them my hostages.mario: All that's left is Bucciarati and one other.Mario: I'll have this taken care of in no time.Mario: They were heading...Mario: to Capri!Mario: They haven't mentioned where the money's hidden, though.Mista: Hey, what do we do about this?JoJo-main: ,He told them where we're heading!Mario: After I get rid of his five friends, I'm gonna make Bucciarati cough it up. Over.Sale: Was that yacht named Lagoon?Sale: What's your current location?Mario: We're about two hours out from Capri.Mario: Bucciarati is wary of anyone following him, so he's taking a very roundabout route.Sale: Got it.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I'll take a high-speed boat and wait for you at Capri.Sale: Dock at Marina Grande. Over and out.Abba: That's the end of the conversation. The radio cut off.Fugo: How could this be?Fugo: This isn't good. With a high-speed vessel,JoJo-main: ,they can get from Naples to Capri in thirty minutes!Mista: That means they're definitely already on the island!Naran: Who is it? Who the hell was on the radio?Mista: I'm going to make this guy tell us who it is, no matter what!Bruno: No, he's a hardcore gangster.JoJo-main: ,It'll probably take some time to get anything out of him.Bruno: He probably won't say anything today.Bruno: Besides, he might not know what his partner's Stand looks like.Bruno: It's very possible his partner's kept it secret even from him.Mista: Then what are we supposed to do?Mista: What if we just come ashore like this?Mista: If they find out we're the ones on this boat instead of Zucchero...Fugo: Also, if this boat doesn't arrive at Marina Grande in about an hour...Fugo: They guy on the radio is sure to think something happened to Zucchero.Fugo: If that happens, who knows if we'll be able to get the money?JoJo-main: ,In fact...Fugo: I have my doubts we'd make it back to Naples in one piece!Abba: What are we going to do, Bucciarati?Bruno: There's no time to hesitate.Bruno: We should at least outfox the guy.Bruno: I'll somehow get to the island first and—Gio: Before this boat docks,Gio: all we need is someone to head to the island first and get rid of the guy.Nara: What the hell are you talking about?Nara: Are you sure you're not stupid?Nara: Get to the island before this boat?JoJo-main: ,What are we supposed to do? Swim there?Gio: Yes.Nara: Huh?!Gio: I can change this ring buoy into a fish.Gio: If I have it pull me, I'll be able to get to the island faster than this boat.Gio: Of course, since it's my Stand, I'll be the one going.Gio: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.Gio: I want that ten billion lire.Gio: We have to use that money to make Bucciarati a capoGio: and move our way up the ranks.Bruno: Giorno...Abba: You're going to go? All right, fine.JoJo-main: ,You've got some good ideas, boy.Abba: But sadly, you don't know this guy's name or what he looks like.Abba: Capri is filled with tourists.Abba: How the hell are you going to find him?Mista: I agree with Giorno's plan.Mista: Even if we don't know who this guy is...Mista: If he's waiting for Zucchero to arrive in this boat,Mista: I think there's a high possibility that we can att*ck firstMista: rather than wait for him to att*ck.Mista: So how many people can that fish pull, Giorno?Mista: My Stand, Six b*ll*ts, is made for k*lling.Mista: It's perfect for situations like this.Mista: I'll be going, too.Sign: Six b*ll*tsSign: Guido MistaGio: It took us quite a while to swim from the yacht to the island.Gio: We have  minutes before the timeJoJo-main: ,Zucchero was supposed to meet up with the man on Capri.Gio: That's about all the time we have left.Mista: Giorno, how does the marina look?Gio: Not good.JoJo-main: ,Just as Abbacchio said, there are a lot of tourists.Gio: And they all look like they're waiting for someone.Gio: They're probably just waiting for sightseeing vessels, but...Gio: Mista, you have a plan to find the guy among that crowd of touristsGio: in the next  minutes, right?Gio: What... are you doing?Mista: It's way past lunchtime.Mista: I'd prefer to go to that restaurant over there,JoJo-main: ,but it's probably a bad idea to have lunch at a restaurantJoJo-main: ,right in front of the marina.Mista: I don't know what this guy looks like,Mista: but he probably knows what I look like since I'm on Bucciarati's team.Mista: That goes for you, too.Gio: I have no idea what you're talking about,Gio: but listen, Mista.Gio: I know we said about  minutes,JoJo-main: ,but if he's the panicky type, we might only have about ten.Gio: Maybe even five.Gio: He may get suspicious when the Lagoon doesn't come into portJoJo-main: ,and figure out that something happened to Zucchero.Gio: If that happens, we won't have a chance to find him.Gio: We have to make our move imme—Mista: And I told you, this is my lunchtime!Mista: Lunchtime is for lunch!Mista: Even boutiques and bookstores in this country honor lunchtime.Mista: No one works if they don't have their lunch.Mista: I'm not saying I'm like that,Mista: but these little guys pretty much expect it.b*llet: Lunchtime!b*llet: Give us food!Mista: Here you go, guys. Lunch is served.Mista: Tuscan salami is delicious!JoJo-main: ,Delicious!JoJo-main: ,This is the best!JoJo-main: ,Hey, gimme that!Mista: Hey, come on now, Number !Mista: Stop making Number  cry!Mista: Stop fighting. There's enough for all of you.Mista: They all believe that they do the most work,JoJo-main: ,so they have the right to eat more than the others.Mista: I work so hard not to play favorites.Mista: Number ! Quit crying already!Gio: What are they?JoJo-main: ,How many of those things do you have?Mista: Hey, don't call them "things."Mista: They get pissed off when they're treated like pets.Mista: There are six of them,JoJo-main: ,and there isn't a Number  because four is bad luck.Mista: There's one for each b*llet.Gio: For each b*llet?Mista: This guy here keeps rushing us.Mista: Could you guys take your nap after your work is done?b*ll*ts: Hell no!Mista: Hey, Number !Mista: I keep telling you not to hit the others!Gio: Mista!Mista: I'll convince these guys to work.JoJo-main: ,So, Giorno...Mista: You get the radio out of that plastic bag.JoJo-main: ,There'll be a feast after we do this job!JoJo-main: ,Let's do this, you guys!Mista: Listen up. I'm going to sneak up to the security watchhouseJoJo-main: ,and hide in its shadows so that no one sees me.Guy: Is there anyone waiting for a yacht named Lagoon?Guy: We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero on the Lagoon!Guy: Please come to the boat watchhouse!Guy: Is there anyone waiting for a yacht named Lagoon?Guy: We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero on the Lagoon!Mista: He might decide to be cautious and not answer the radio call...Guy: Please come to the boat watchhouse!Mista: Or he might get excited and run out, thinking the hiding placeJoJo-internal/narrator: ,of the ten billion lire has been found.Mista: This is a gamble,Guy: Is there anyone waiting for the Lagoon?Mista: but the one who comes to the boat watchhouseJoJo-internal/narrator: ,to answer that radio call is our guy.Guy: We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero!Mista: Giorno, if anyone comes near the watchhouse, give me a signal.Guy: If you're waiting for the Lagoon, please come to the boat watchhouse!Mista: I'm gonna sh**t the guy who takes the radio call!Mista: But Bucciarati told me to not k*ll him, so I'll miss any vital points.Mista: Or at least, I'll try.Gio: No one's making a move yet...Gio: No one's heading over there.Guy: Is there no one?Guy: No one's waiting for the Lagoon?Guy: There's a transmission from Mr. Zucchero!Gio: No, there's no one. Nothing.Gio: He's supposed to be somewhere on this island.Gio: Is he just being too cautious to answer the radio call?Sale: Did something happen, Zucchero?Sale: Why did you request an announcement?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is there a problem? Over.Gio: What's going on?Gio: No one's heading toward the watchhouse.Gio: He's there! How?!Gio: This isn't good. Does that watchhouse have a back entrance?Gio: He's already inside the watchhouse!Gio: It's too dark to see his face.Gio: Mista hasn't realized he's in there!Gio: At this rate, the guy's going to realize this is a trap and run!Gio: I have to let Mista know!Mista: What? The guy's coming to answer the radio call?Mista: Which one is it?Mista: Who's heading toward the watchhouse?Gio: N-No!Gio: He's not heading there!Gio: He's already inside!Gio: Don't come out!Gio: He's by the window!Sale: That guy is...Sale: one of Bucciarati's guys!Sale: Didn't Zucchero take care of him on the yacht?Gio: Mista! Behind you!Gio: He's on the radio! Mista!Gio: Damn it! He can't hear me.Gio: It's better than him not noticing!Gio: He's already there!Gio: Mista! He's already on the radio!JoJo-main: ,Come on! Pass, pass, pass!Mista: Go, Six b*ll*ts!Menace,Sfx: Menacingb*llet: Here we go!b*ll*ts: sh**t!Bazoo,Sfx: Bazoob*ll*ts: Yay!b*ll*ts: Heck yeah!b*ll*ts: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!Gio: D-Did he get him?Guy: Wh-Who the hell are you?!Guy: Wh-What was that noise?Mista: g*nshots.Mista: Did it bother you?JoJo-main: ,It probably wasn't as loud as in the movies.Mista: But if it did bother you...Mista: I'm sorta busy right now,Mista: so I'll listen to your complaints later.Mista: Guess Giorno just can't wait.Mista: So there was a rear entrance...Mista: Meaning he came through this door and got on the radio.Mista: Either he was being cautiousJoJo-main: ,or he's just used to always going through the back door.Mista: Still...JoJo-main: ,Good job, b*ll*ts!b*llet: Yay!b*llet: Leg!b*llet: Leg! Hey, hey!b*llet: We got his right leg!b*llet: We sh*t him right through his right leg!Mista: Yeah, you sure did.Mista: Now he won't get away!Mista: There are a bunch of people outside...Mista: And this side is basically a cliff.Mista: There's no way he could climb up.Mista: He must be scurrying about right now.Mista: If he were to hide somewhere...Mista: He must be in that truck.Mista: If he's a Stand user, his Stand is probably close-range and extremely powerful.Mista: If he was a remote-control type, he would've att*cked me by now.Mista: In that case, the guy who just got sh*t in the legMista: is probably hiding behind the truck,Mista: trying to lure me as close to him as possible so that he can att*ck.Mista: Well, it's not like he's going to get me, even if I get close to him.Mista: He's probably just beyond there.Mista: But so long as we don't know what his Stand is,Mista: going over there alone isn't a safe plan at all.Mista: I should wait for Giorno and—Mista: Well, I guess that option's out.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,The guy's in the driver's seat.Mista: He must've jump-started the engine.Mista: It'll be bad news if this truck gets away right now.Mista: Damn it! This isn't good!Mista: I haven't seen his face yet!Mista: Giorno probably hasn't, either!Mista: I don't know what his Stand is yet, but I don't have a choice!Mista: This is for the ten billion and Bucciarati!Mista: Eat lead!Gio: Mista!
