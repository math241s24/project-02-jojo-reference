If I'm going to take over this city,Giorno: I'll have to join the organization that rules it and work my way up.Giorno: Bucciarati,Giorno: I'm going to become a g*ng-Star!Kid : Pass! Pass!Kids: Thanks!Kids: Thanks.Kids: Thanks!Bruno: Fine.Bruno: I'll report back saying I couldn't find the one who att*cked LucaBruno: and introduce you so you can join the organization.Bruno: However, if they find out at any time that you're going after the boss...Bruno: I'm not going to save you.Bruno: Traitors can't be saved.Giorno: You'll have to deal with your own failure.Bruno: Otherwise, I'll wager on your golden dream andJoJo-main: ,the honorable, golden resolve it took to go so far as to rip off your own arm,Bruno: Giorno Giovanna.Bruno: Our organization oversees every industry in Naples.Bruno: Passione... That's the name of the organization.Bruno: Passione means "passion," but that's not actually related to the boss's name.Bruno: No one actually knows the boss's name, nor does anyone know what he looks like.Bruno: We receive orders from a number of his capos.Bruno: Giorno, the capo who'll be deciding whether you'll join the organizationJoJo-main: ,is a man named Polpo.Bruno: He's in this building.Giorno: But this building...Loom,Sfx: LoomGiorno: It's a prison.Bruno: Correct. Polpo was convicted of a certain crimeJoJo-main: ,and won't be out for fifteen years.Bruno: But he gives me orders from the inside and commands the organization.Bruno: He can leave this place whenever he feels like it, but he doesn't.Bruno: There's simply no reason to.Giorno: But why?Bruno: You'll understand once you go in.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna, you're going to be interviewed by him, and you have to pass.Bruno: It's basically like any other job interview.Bruno: What the interview actually entails will depend on his mood,Bruno: but whatever you do, don't let him find out your true intentions.Giorno: All right.Giorno: Oh, yeah. The Stand ability...JoJo-main: ,That's what you called it, right?Giorno: I never asked how you ended up with that ability,Giorno: but are there others with it?Bruno: That'll also be answered once you get inside...Bruno: If you pass, that is.Cop: First, place your belongings, watch,JoJo-main: ,and everything in your pockets into the tray,Cop: then proceed to the next room for a body check.Lady: Stand right there and raise your hands over your head.Lady: Once you go through that gate, please continue straight down the hall.Lady: N- is where Polpo's cell is.Lady: The room is divided with reinforced glass, but you'll be able to talk to him.Lady: Touching the glass, giving him anything,JoJo-main: ,and receiving anything from him are all forbidden.Lady: You have fifteen minutes.Lady: Once you pass through, the gate will close.Lady: If something happens, please yell.Bruno: I'm going to meet him directly in his cell?Bruno: Not in some visiting room?Lady: You don't know who he is?Polpo: That left arm of yours...JoJo-main: ,Is it injured?Giorno: That's no bed...Loom,Sfx: GwoooPolpo: It's just on your right hand,Polpo: but the fingers are slightly red, like you were holding something.Polpo: Like lines that would be left after holding a bag.Polpo: Which would mean that you were holding a bag in your right hand up until now.Polpo: Why's that?Giorno: Well, uh... You're right.Giorno: I was holding a bag in my right hand,Giorno: because as you observed, I hurt my left arm.Polpo: I envy your ability to be so reckless with your body.Polpo: Would you like some wine?JoJo-main: ,I have some exquisite Chianti Classico.Polpo: It pairs perfectly with some Scamorza cheese and caviar on a cr*cker.Giorno: I've been told that I'm not allowedJoJo-main: ,to give you anything or receive anything from you.Polpo: They're just saying that.Polpo: What people say and what they do...Polpo: are vastly different.Polpo: That's the best and worst thing about people.Polpo: The only downside to being in this cell is.... well...Giorno: Polpo...Polpo: The fact that I can't admire Michelangelo's great painting in the Sistine Chapel.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,It's not that he doesn't need to leave the prison.Giorno: Things would just be the same for him whether he left or not.Giorno: With that body, he might actually be safer in the cell.Giorno: More importantly, how did he get through the door?Polpo: Bucciarati's told me all about you.Polpo: So you want to join our organization?JoJo-main: ,Hmm... Giorno Giovanna, was it?Polpo: Well, why don't we get this interview started?Giorno: What the hell was that?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Did my eyes play a trick on me?Giorno: For a moment, it looked like he took a bite out of his finger along with the cr*cker...Giorno: No... Maybe Polpo is also a Stand user, just like Bucciarati.Giorno: Either way, I can't let him find out that I'm one, as well.Polpo: What do you think is the most important thingJoJo-main: ,when it comes to choosing someone, Giorno Giovanna?Giorno: Is it what they're capable of?Polpo: Oh? And what exactly are you capable of?Giorno: I borrowed a few things when she was patting me down.Giorno: I thought these would be useful for your test.Giorno: Of course, I'll be returning them to her when I leave.Polpo: Do you have anything else?Giorno: Other than that, the only skill I haveJoJo-main: ,is being able to completely fold my ear into my head.Polpo: That's rather amusing.Polpo: But, you see...Polpo: There's something else that's far more important,Polpo: and that's trust, Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: The most important thing when it comes to choosing people is trust.Polpo: In comparison, being smart or being talented means as muchJoJo-main: ,as this piece of cr*cker between my teeth.Polpo: This test is all about seeing how trustworthy you are...Polpo: with this lighter's flame.Polpo: Take it, and make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: Whoa, there.JoJo-main: ,Be extra careful to make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: Fuller, the th-century theologian, said,JoJo-main: ,"He's my friend that speaks well of me behind my back."Polpo: In order to join our organization,JoJo-main: ,you'll have to show how trustworthy you are when we can't see you.Polpo: For  hours, you will hold on to that lighter without letting the flame go out.Polpo: If you can do that, I'll approve of you joining the organization.Polpo: Simple, right?JoJo-main: ,The lighter has plenty of fluid in it.Polpo: All you have to do is sit quietly in your room until  PM tomorrowJoJo-main: ,and make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: If you're a careful man who'll work hard to make sure it doesn't go out,JoJo-main: ,the flame shouldn't go out.Polpo: Which means you're someone we can trust.Polpo: However...Polpo: If you're a man who is taking us too lightly,Polpo: and you fall asleep, sneeze, or knock it over,Polpo: or a sudden wind blows the flame out...Polpo: It means that you're untrustworthy,Polpo: and I can't allow you to join our organization.Polpo: Now, take the lighter.Polpo: This is your entrance exam.Polpo: You have  hours.Polpo: I'm looking forward to seeing you come to visit me again tomorrow at  PM.Giorno: For  hours...Cop: All visitors must go through another body check when they go through the gate.Cop: Once you're told that you can leave the facility,Cop: please continue to the next room and grab your belongings.Giorno: Wait! Polpo didn't tell you anything?Lady: What?Lady: I'm going to pat you down now.Lady: Let me remind you that it's prohibited for you to accept anything from him!Giorno: sh*t! I was under the impression that Polpo bribed all these guys,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,giving me permission to take the lighter out of here!Giorno: Visitor, put your hands up and proceed forward!Giorno: So Polpo's test for me has already started...Giorno: And...Giorno: I have no choice but to go through with it!Giorno: I have to pass this test and get into Passione!Sign: Koichi HiroseSign: Reverb Act Lady: Visitor, hurry forward!Giorno: Just like I hid her ID in my hand where no one could see earlier,Lady: Put your hands up and proceed forward! I will conduct a body check!Giorno: I'll hide this flame!Lady: You're free to go.JoJo-main: ,There are no problems here.Lady: You may leave this facility.Lady: However...Lady: Please open up your hand.Lady: Let me remind you that it's prohibited to accept anything from him.Lady: Visitor, open up your hand! I'm going to check it.Lady: A flower?Lady: A real flower?Lady: Very well. I'll allow you to take that out.Lady: You are permitted to leave this facility.Giorno: I turned the lighter into a flower and hid the flame within it.Giorno: That was too close.Giorno: But is this flame Polpo's Stand ability?Giorno: The wind's definitely bad news!Guy: Hey, Giorno! Perfect timing!Guy: Could you push the shutter button on the camera?Giorno: No.Old: Sorry, but could you help me out here?Giorno: No.Giorno: I finally made it back to my dorm.Giorno: Th-That was close...Giorno: Now the lighter won't fall over, and even if the air moves,JoJo-main: ,the flame will be protected.Giorno: Now, just as Polpo said, I just need to watch over this for the next  hours.Giorno: I know.JoJo-main: ,I'll make sure my window is locked, just in case.Giorno: I need to make sure it doesn't randomly open and allow the wind to blow in here.Giorno: What?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Who's opening my door without even knocking?Giorno: Th-That's—Koichi: Looks like he's out.Koichi: Now's my chance.Giorno: It's that Japanese guy again!Giorno: His name was... Koichi Hirose!Giorno: How did he find out my address?Koichi: Looks like my suitcase and belongings are long gone.Koichi: But my passport might still be around.Koichi: It's probably harder to sell someone's ID.Koichi: I feel like a thief, sneaking into someone's room like this, but...Koichi: No! He's the thief here!Koichi: What's so wrong with trying to find what belongs to me?!Giorno: His passport? sh*t!Giorno: It's in the documents case on top of my desk becauseJoJo-internal/narrator: ,I'd planned to return it to him!Giorno: At this rate, Koichi's going to see the lighter's flame!Giorno: Then he'll probably put it out!Giorno: He'll think it'll set the place on fire!Giorno: What should I do?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I have to hurry up and retrieve that lighter!Giorno: Golden Wind!Giorno: I used Golden Wind to turn the light cord into a snake.Giorno: That bread is pretty delicious.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Good job biting into it!Giorno: Now I'll pull it up with the cord...Giorno: What? sh*t!Giorno: I can't believe this.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,He found the lighter.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,This isn't good.Giorno: I have to make sure he doesn't blow the flame out!Koichi: Oh?Koichi: This mark! The mark symbolizing Japan!Koichi: I found it! It's my passport!Koichi: I-It's burning!Koichi: Thank goodness...JoJo-main: ,Huh?Koichi: That's strange. I could've sworn I saw a lit lighter...Giorno: That was close.JoJo-main: ,He almost extinguished the flame.Giorno: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!Giorno: And to take my first step toward that dream,Giorno: I have to protect this flame, no matter what!Old: Whoa, that was close.Old: Sorry about that. I was cleaning the stairs.Old: I'm glad it was just a slight mist and the water didn't actually hit you.Old: This must mean we've both done good things in our daily lives.Old: Your daily actions are very important.Old: If you weren't careful, you'd probably be wearing that bucket of water on your head.Giorno: Seriously? This isn't good.JoJo-main: ,The flame...Giorno: I wonder if I can ask Polpo to let me try again.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,No...Giorno: If he were that forgiving, he wouldn't have tested me with this.Old: Flame?Old: Is that lighter not lighting up anymore?Old: Is it broken? Is it my fault?Giorno: No, it wasn't you.JoJo-main: ,I'm actually trying to process what happened...Old: But from what I can see, it doesn't look broken.JoJo-main: ,The lighter is still letting gas out.Giorno: What did you just say?Whoosh,Sfx: WhooshOld: Yes, there's still gas coming out.JoJo-main: ,Is this the switch?Old: Did you try pushing it?Giorno: No... It shouldn't be able to light.Old: But look at this fine craftsmanship!Giorno: This whole test depended on if the flame was lit or not.Old: It's a very impressive lighter.Giorno: If I were able to just light it again, there's be no point in this test!Old: I was startled by the size of the flame, but it looks like it's working fine.Old: See?Old: By the way, since you have that lighter, you're not smoking cigarettes, are you?Giorno: Something's wrong.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,It actually lit up again... There has to be something wrong!Giorno: What the...Giorno: That couldn't be his Sta—Black: You relit the lighter, didn't you?Black: I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths.Giorno: Th-That's...Black: The first path is to live and become a chosen one.Black: Your only other path is death.Giorno: A Stand!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,That's gotta be Polpo's Stand!JoJo-main: ,There's no doubt about it!Black: You relit the lighter!Black: This is your fate!Giorno: No way! You bastard! What the hell are you doing?!Black: This soul...JoJo-main: ,did not belong to one who should be chosen.Giorno: One who should be chosen?Giorno: H-Hey, are you...Giorno: He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...Giorno: Was it because...Giorno: That Stand pulls people's souls out and kills them with an arrow?Giorno: Is that it?Giorno: But does "the one who should be chosen"JoJo-internal/narrator: ,mean someone who can join the g*ng?Black: You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?Black: I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...
