I can see myself...Bruno: What am I doing back there?Bruno: The handle's not bent!Bruno: Did I misunderstand what's going on?Bruno: I just thought I was moving with incredible power...Bruno: But my body's actually still over there,JoJo-main: ,and my consciousness just jumped out, and that's what's over here?Bruno: Crap! I have to dodge!Bruno: I-It hurts!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,A very sharp pain is gradually hitting me!Bruno: It's not that Giorno's slow...

It doesn't seem like he even knows what a Stand is.Bruno: But this ability...Giorno: It appears as though both of our abilities only reach a few meters.Bruno: And here I thought you were just some bratJoJo-main: ,who wasn't affiliated with any organization...Bruno: Giorno Giovanna!JoJo-main: ,You're the one who att*cked Leaky Eye Luca, aren't you?!Bruno: My boss wants to know why you att*cked him!Giorno: You wouldn't believe me if I told you it was an accident, would you?Giorno: So I'm going to be disposed of, right?Giorno: And you came here fully prepared, right?Giorno: When you're going to dispose of someone,Giorno: you're always prepared for the possibility thatJoJo-main: ,you could end up being the one disposed of, right?Bruno: He's going to k*ll me... He's serious!Bruno: This brat is actually going to try to k*ll me!Bruno: He's intense enoughJoJo-internal/narrator: ,that he'd actually do what he says he's going to do!Kabaam,Sfx: KabaamBruno: Zipper Man!Giorno: So that's his Stand?Kabaam,Sfx: KashinkBruno: Now I know for sure that my Zipper Man is more powerful.Bruno: I wasn't told that I need to bring the suspect back alive.Bruno: I wouldn't mind taking care of you here.Bruno: But I've had my fill of dealing with your dangerous powers today,Bruno: so I'm leaving.Bruno: I'm going to keep my distance for now,Bruno: but I'll take care of you eventually.Giorno: He can even pass through a solid wall by putting a zipper on it?!Giorno: This isn't good!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Letting him out of the cable car is gonna be trouble!Giorno: If I lose him now, it won't matter that I have Golden Wind!Giorno: If he's going to come after me / with that ability,Giorno: there's absolutely no guarantee I'll survive!Giorno: I'm going to lose!Giorno: I can't let him get away!Giorno: If he tells his friends about me, this will end up out of my control!Giorno: I have to stop him right here, right now!Giorno: For the sake of my future!Guy: O-Ow!Guy C: Be more careful, damn it!Giorno: He disappeared!Giorno: Where could he have gone in that instant?Giorno: Don't tell me he can even enter people with his zipper!Guy: What are you going to do about this? I'm covered in garbage!Giorno: But that's the only thing I can think of!Giorno: That must be how he got that eyeball and those fingers inside me!Giorno: Bucciarati went into one of these guys to hide, like wearing a costume...Giorno: And that's how he's planning to head back into the city.Guy: Better get my broom...Giorno: They're all heading in different directions.Giorno: I don't see a zipper.Giorno: Which one is it?Giorno: Which one is he hiding in?Guy: What the hell's your problem, you stupid fly?!Jump,Sfx: JumpBruno: A tooth?Giorno: I gave life to the tooth that broke out of your mouthGiorno: and had it be reborn as a fly.Giorno: The fly would return to you so I could tell where you were...Giorno: But this isn't good.Giorno: I just got done saying we wouldn't involve any civilians...Giorno: But my bad. That was a lie.Giorno: Still, he ended up hitting himself with his own power,Giorno: so I hope you can just deal with it.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna, I can see your ability is not to be underestimated.Bruno: You leave me no choice.JoJo-main: ,This will be dangerous,Bruno: but it seems I'll have to take care of you right here, right now.Giorno: I can't let you escape.Giorno: I'm pretty determined about that.Bruno: Let me escape?JoJo-main: ,You don't have to worry about that.Bruno: The only thing you have to worry aboutBruno: is what you'll do once your body parts have been zipped apart all over the ground.Bruno: This battle will be decided by who hits the other first.Bruno: What's the matter?Bruno: Come at me, Giorno Giovanna.Gold: Useless!Thud,Sfx: ThudGiorno: Just your senses will go berserk.Bruno: "You hit me first, so how?"Bruno: I don't blame you for wondering that.Bruno: This isn't my arm.Bruno: My Zipper Man's ability allows two separate things to be connected with a zipper.Bruno: This is that kid's arm.Bruno: I switched it out with mine.Bruno: Because, of course, I'd rather avoid the danger of being hit with your ability.Bruno: That's why your Golden Wind didn't work.Bruno: What are you trying to do, Giorno Giovanna?!Bruno: I'm ending you right now!Bruno: Unbelievable... He ripped off his own armBruno: to extend his range a bit further and strike a moment faster...Giorno: Golden Wind!Bruno: I-It's happening again!JoJo-main: ,Just my senses have gone berserk!Bruno: H-He's going to get me!Bruno: The destructive power of Giorno Giovanna's Stand ability isn't too great...Bruno: But in this case, that actually makes things worse!Bruno: If I have to experience that slow pain not once, but multiple times...Bruno: I'll probably die from the shock of the pain!Bruno: Don't!Bruno: Stop!Bruno: He went out of range?Bruno: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Bruno: Why did you stop attacking me?Bruno: Why didn't you finish me off?!giorno: Because you're a good person.Giorno: You're in a g*ng, but you're a good person.giorno: You hesitated for a moment before attacking me,giorno: so I decided I wouldn't att*ck you, either.Giorno: When you saw the arm you took off of this kid,Giorno: you were shocked to see the state it was inGiorno: and stopped attacking for a moment.Giorno: You were shocked that he'd been sh**ting up dr*gs.Giorno: How old is he?Giorno: Thirteen.Giorno: If you were just some gangster who wouldn't have hesitated or been shocked,Giorno: I probably would've been rolling around on the ground in pieces.Giorno: But you seem different.JoJo-main: ,That's why I stopped.Giorno: There are people in this city who would sell dr*gs to kids.Giorno: They're unforgivable.Giorno: That's what you believe.Giorno: But the one selling those dr*gs is your boss.Giorno: You can't help but feel conflicted about that.Giorno: That's why your heart ached when you saw his arm.Bruno: So what? That's got nothing to do with me eliminating you.Bruno: I've been ordered to find the one who att*cked Luca and eliminate them!Bruno: Just because you stopped attacking me doesn't mean I'm not going to k*ll you!Giorno: No...JoJo-main: ,You won't k*ll me now.Bruno: What?Giorno: You won't k*ll me. I know it.Bruno: Why do you say that?Giorno: Because you're going to join me.Giorno: I plan on defeating your boss and taking over this city.Bruno: What?!Giorno: In order to get rid of gangs that sell dr*gs to children,Giorno: I'm going to have to become a gangster myself.Bruno: Are you saying...JoJo-main: ,that you're going to join our organization?!Bruno: Are you serious?!JoJo-main: ,Do you even know what that means?!Giorno: What a great view...Giorno: Yes. If I'm going to take over this city,Giorno: I'll have to join the organization that rules it and work my way up.Giorno: Bucciarati,JoJo-main: ,I'm going to become a g*ng-Star!
