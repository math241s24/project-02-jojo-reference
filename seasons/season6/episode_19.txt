05x19 - Birth of the 'Green'QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:29He is currently in a sleep state. He wakes up sitting up cross-legged, stays awake for a few hours, then falls asleep for another  hours. It's all understandable. His entire memory is gone, after all. How is he retaining new information since getting resuscitated? It's normal. He has learned about  English words so far. However, he does not comprehend his identity. Even his family… He doesn't show any response, even to his daughter's photos. His brain waves and EKG are within normal parameters. But his muscle mass has decreased. With all his memories gone, he does not feel any reason to live, causing the body to rapidly atrophy. What can we do, Doctor? I cannot say. His only chance of recovery might be retrieving his memory. Doctor, do not touch his head! He got hurt! We must treat him! I'm sorry, Doctor. I forgot to warn you. Did he use his Stand just now? He did. However, that wasn't from his consciousness. It was just his instinctive bodily reflex to defend. "Jo… Lyne." "Jolyne"? No… that's not possible. I've always… I've always cared about you. Something's going on with your cut. It was fixed. I know I just filled it in. It looks like some sort of writing, doesn't it? Should I try to fill it again? Wait. Don't fill this one. I can't explain it, but… I just know it. This is a message from my father. He's had so much to protect even before I was born. He was always away to keep dangers like the one I'm in now away from me and Mom. I felt it, just now.  My body tells me that I understand my father now. EPISODE : BIRTH OF THE "GREEN" -Hey F.F. -What? Can you trip Jolyne down the stairs? Just a little bit will do. Why would I do that? I said, try to trip her. We won't let her get hurt, of course. I want to catch her from falling with my own arms. What? Jolyne doesn't seem like she understood that I saved her. I want to embrace her tightly one more time. Now, get to it. -Trip her. -Why don't you do it? That's sexual harassment. I already told you. I'm going to marry Jolyne. And you promised to cooperate. Or do you not keep your word? Now, go do it. I'm sorry, Jolyne. The small man! He's right here! He was spying on us from above! Look! He has the bone in his hand! This fucker sure moves in a funny way, but he won't get away! Hold it! Do you see his back contorting? You called him a small man. It's true he fit the description earlier. -But something strange is happening… -Sunbathing… Isn't he growing taller? He's as tall as me, no, he's taller than me now. You have nowhere to run. Turn around slowly. The sunlight is nice and warm. Light is good. I said turn around, you little sh*t! Bleh… Bleh. What the f*ck is with him? Light, bleh, warm. We are happy… as we gather around… and it's warm. Bleh. What was that? Did you see that stuff splatter? He could be a Stand User! Keep your distance. It doesn't seem to be a Stand. I don't know what it is, but we mustn't touch him. Where's the bone? The bone he had earlier. Where is it now? What the… The other prisoners have already fallen prey. Those look like plants. They're still growing. What happened to them, and who did this? What is the meaning of this? Should I assume that it's a Stand ability? This bone, along with the power and some sort of will that sprouted these plants… It's as if they are trying to give birth to something. It bloomed the flowers first, then the plants matured. They grew out at the end of the person's life. Now, what to do with this bone that the man dropped… Merely touching this bone or anyone who grabbed it can be dangerous, after all. Don't take another step, Jolyne Cujoh! Stop right there! Show me your face. Turn around. -What? -It's nothing. I want to take a moment to check something. What the hell is wrong with you? Let go of her, assh*le! F.F., you stay silent. The bone transformed the prisoners in the Disciplinary Wing into that state. It can't be an enemy Stand, since that would have targeted us from the start. And if I'm not mistaken, Jolyne, I think I saw your thread touching that bone when it was still in his grasp. The bone! It's rolling away! She's infected! Jolyne! But how? Diver Drive! Yes! Weed them all out from the inside, quick! There's more! Why did you stop? I wouldn't exactly say they're growing out of her or that they need to be rooted out. Rather, her body itself is transforming into plants. Is it safe to pull them out? Jolyne, does it hurt? No. I guess I did touch that bone. Anyway, you should stay away from me now that I'm infected. It might spread to you. These are just plants, nothing more, nothing less. I can't tell what species they are, but its stems are filled with chlorophyll, not blood. Either way, I'll take care of it. I promise. The sunlight! Get in the shade. If you touch sunlight or move toward the light, the plants will grow rapidly. Step farther into the shade, and the plants recede. Damn, what does it want? I can't say, but I still need to get that bone. And just how will you do that? If you hold the bone, you'll turn into a plant, Jolyne! I will pick it up. I'm already becoming a plant. Don't go where the sunlight touches, Jolyne! The bone… Where is it? Where can it be? I thought I saw it rolling towards this flower. A star shape? What is this bruise-like mark? It's see-through. There's something else underneath. A child… It's a green child! STAND NAME: YA-YA MA STAND MASTER: D AN' G What is it shaped like? Carrots that look like Snoopy, breast-shaped radishes, and other shapes are found all the time during harvests. This is just like those. It really just resembles a child. It's alive! Impossible! Jolyne, forget about it and come back! Haven't you noticed? Your legs are turning too. They are attaching to the vines! What is this thing? Is it a plant, or is it a human? It turned the prisoners in the Disciplinary Wing into plants, joined their roots, and became a fruit! The bone must have gotten implanted inside this fruit. Pale Snake is at this prison to discover what lies beyond this point. What will it spawn? He wants to know what transpires when it is born. I told you to come back, Jolyne. The sun is moving westward, causing more sunlight to enter. You must move further back. Are you taking that with you? We call this seizing by force, F.F. I will not let Pale Snake have it. Come, Jolyne. We must move opposite the sun's direction. Anastasia. This wing's entrance is to the west. We'll never leave this shitty place if we go east. There's at least one other Stand User somewhere in this wing. Escape, huh. Help me, please. Someone help! Please! After everyone drowned, they turned into plants and d*ed! How horrible! I'm begging you! I don't want to turn into a plant! Please, get me out of here! Fine. What's your name? Are you hurt? What are you saying, Anastasia? He could be our enemy. Are they right? Are you against us? I don't know what you are talking about. My name is Guccio. I just don't want to turn into a plant! Calm down. I said it's fine. Stand up, Guccio. Surely you can do that much. Now hurry it up. Do you know this? A human has  pairs of ribs, or  bones in total. Whether a man or a woman, tall or short, we all have the same number of ribs. Good. Now go. I guess he wasn't our enemy after all. I couldn't care less either way. I'm only interested in safely leaving through the east side of this building. Isn't that right? The keyword is "safely." Let's leave from there. A green child… I wasn't told about any of this, but my job is simple. Finish off Jolyne Cujoh. Just that, and nothing more. I will merely complete my assignment. Where are they? Where did Jolyne Cujoh and her two allies go? Have they already left the building? No, they cannot leave without me knowing. Hey you, what are you doing there? Hey, I'm talking to you. Where did those three go? And how did you manage to avoid becoming a plant? Walk… outside… -Save me… -How terrible. Someone restructured his body into a human trap! f*ck, it hurts! Mommy, it hurts! I don't want this shitty arm anymore! I got screwed. I'm only here because Pale Snake ordered me to cause a fight in here with my Survivor Stand. But forget that now. I'm finally outside now. GUCCIO STAND NAME: SURVIVOR - BEYOND RECOVERY Anyway, it looks like we got away from the other Stand User. The plants withered away. I guess it was a temporary bloom. The problem is that it's about time for someone from the prison to realize the abnormalities going on in the Disciplinary Wing. That works in our favor. Once that happens, then Pale Snake will realize it too. He will appear close to us. This is the best chance yet of getting my father's disc back. Jolyne, watch out! Stone Ocean! It's an enemy Stand! He must belong to that gladiator-looking man! He swallowed the fruit! I won't let them have it! assh*le! Diver Drive! What is up with his body? He stinks… really bad! Go deeper, please! -sh*t, my Stand can't enter it! -Punish me more, please! I can feel it through my Stand! My body's starting to stink from the inside! Those shoes of yours. Did my bodily liquid dirty them? I am very sorry. Now please, come sit on this chair. Let me lick your shoes clean. Would you like this comic book? I lifted it from the guards' break room. Careful, there's a bee. My master is named D an' G. The last I saw of him, he was in the Disciplinary Wing. His right arm got ripped off and he was crying for his mommy. It's a remotely controlled Stand! He wants to take the fruit to his User! sh*t, they've noticed. The guards are coming! Jolyne, we must leave for now. Let's go toward the wetlands. There must be a water bike or a boat somewhere close. This is how to tell wild strawberries apart. The ones with yellow flowers are mock strawberries, so don't eat them. Shut your annoying trap. We can't leave this Stand alone. We need to find a way to get that green child out of its belly. I know that. F.F., we have no choice but to take it. We'll leave you to find its User and finish him off. Got it. Oh, you want me to go with you, Master. This boat here is built specifically for the wetlands, Master. It has a propeller engine, and it uses wind to propel forward. sh*t, how do I start the ignition? Is there a lock somewhere? It's a throttle lever, Master. Usually, it must be put in neutral first, like this. This stick is for steering. Push it forward to turn the empennage to the right, and pull the stick back to turn it to the left. -Release the tether. -Yes, Master. Jolyne, do not take your eyes off that Stand. While it's in your sight, it'll act like an obedient servant. Though creepy, it will prove useful to you. But turn your back on it for a second, and… f*ck… Who would have thought that was an att*ck? Jolyne, Anastasia… Don't let it out of your sight!
