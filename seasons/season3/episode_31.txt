You need to work onyour approach, but... Smooch!  Avdol, I forgot to tell you,  but don't touchany electrical outlets.  I'm afraid I already did,Mr. Joestar.  What?  Two magnetsnext to each other will...   stick together!   Mr. Joestar, we're in...   ...big trouble, I know!    EPISODE   :BAST'S MARIAH, PART      Hey! Wait!   Damn it...   She just turned the corner!After her!   Blast it! I can't believemy body's become a magnet, too!   Calm down, Avdol!   Getting hysterical won't help us.   Just focus on how to defeatthis Stand!   Now where is that woman?Damn it!   I don't see her.   Well, we can't stay herelike this forever.   Let's slowly try to stand up.   Very well.   All right, we did it.   Now, let's try to pull awayfrom each other.   Since we're stuck together,   the magnetic force holding ustogether is double.   Let's get to that fence.   Then we'll grab onand pull away from each other.   We can do it, Avdol!Get those stomach muscles ready!   Stay in sync!   Right, Mr. Joestar.   -One!-Two!   Mr. Joestar... I have to say,this is quite embarrassing.   Hey! What do you thinkyou're looking at?   We're practicing our dance moves.It's called dancing!   What a perfect dayfor dancing outdoors!   Now scram, damn it!   All right.Almost there, Avdol.   -One, two, and...-One, two, and...   We did it!We made it without falling!   Indeed...   Avdol, think you can slide off me?   Yes, I might be able to.   All right...   I'll hang on to the fence,and you slide down.   Free yourself once you're atthe tip of my foot.   Look, our faces are stuck together,so that means   my feet and your headshould repel each other.   Right...   NEGATIVE POSITIVEPOSITIVE NEGATIVE   All right! That's it.   What's wrong, Avdol?   Isn't this position a bit...   It's highly suggestive...   If anyone sees us,they might think...   No one's looking!Hurry up and slide off my...   They brought their friends!   Hey! Get lost, brats!Stop looking at us!   Hey! I said b*at it, you damn...   Avdol, hurry!Hurry up and get off me!   I'm trying...   I can't believethis is happening to me!   The embarrassment!   Fine, then I'll move!   Mr. Joestar, slow down!   Mr. Joestar, if you move like that...   It's that old hag again!   I come back for my handsome manand find this?   How dare you toywith a maiden's heart?   Cheater!   Hurry! Hurry, Avdol!The tears are coming!   You scoundrel!   Wait... This is a misunderstanding!   We did it!   We need to stay far apartfrom each other!   Your magnetic pullis getting stronger.   Curse you, damned fool!Go to hell!   There she is. It's her.   Look at her, smoking a cigarette...   Avdol, you go from that side.   Don't let her get away this time.   She's cunning.   This may be a trap.   No, Mr. Joestar...   It seems we've already falleninto her trap!   Railroad tracks!   My foot is stuck!   We're...   stuck...   -together again!-together again!   Son of a bi--   Mr. Joestar, something's...   That sound...Oh, no! We can't stay here!   Avdol, use Magician's Redto burn through the tracks!   We need to get out of here now!   But, Mr. Joestar...    It's coming! The train's coming!Hurry up and melt these tracks!    I can't.If I burn away the tracks...    The train will derail,and innocent people will die!    She's pure evil...    I could try to grab herwith my vines,    but she's out of range.    I might be able to pull us freeusing this post...    It's no use!    The magnetic pullis even stronger now.    Mr. Joestar, keep pulling!Keep trying!    It's coming! Pull harder!    Now what?    I win.    BASTMARIAH    I've won, Lord Dio!    Now to k*ll Jotaro and Polnareff!    Good thinking, Avdol!    You b*rned throughthe railroad ties    and dug a hole!    This is it!    This suits the imageof Mohammed Avdol!    This is the rolemy character plays!    Clever little bastard...    You...    sh*t-eating b*tches!    Magician's Red!    Hermit Purple!    I've got you!    Now, young lady...    I regret that I'm now goingto strangle you enough    to put you in the hospitalfor a week.    Your magnetism is rathertroublesome, you know.    What are you imagining?My chest didn't get bigger...    Your magnetism just got stronger.    This is what I had in my pockets.    The weapons I had in my pockets!    Mr. Joestar, duck!    Magician's Red!    Your magnetic force will keepgrowing stronger...    Until your bodies are crushed.    She's getting away!    No, she's not escaping.    She's keeping a certain distancebetween us.    I'm sure that woman fights by    staying neither too closenor too far.    If she gets too close to us,she'll be caught.    If she goes too far,the magnetism stops working.    This magnetismis the work of a Stand,    so it follows the rules of Stands.    Once the user is too far away,its power weakens!    What shall we do?    She said the magnetismwould keep getting stronger.    Shall we flee untilthe magnetic force expires?    No. Even if we were ableto escape this magnetism,    it won't meanwe defeated the Stand.    I, Joseph Joestar,    have strategically retreated fromfights in my younger days,    but I've never onceabandoned a fight.    I'm going to keep fightingwith all my might!    This is a map of the city.Right now, we're here.    The woman is here.    If she continues down this road,    she'll loop aroundand head back this way.    We'll split up    and catch the woman here.    I won't think of heras a woman anymore.    I'll get her, no matter what!    After her!    Hey, look.    The rails have been cut...    People from the city have arrived.    I'm sure they'll report the damagebefore the next train comes.    Let's go!    Seems like something's going on.    Someone cut the rail line!    Will the trains be okay?    They've stopped running for now.    Someone cut the rail line?    That's a pretty crappy thing to do.    Why would someone do that?Are they stupid?    You know, Jotaro...    I think people like thatwill get what they deserve.    I spent three months' pay on this.    Let's get married!    Oh, my...    Huh? Wait, what?    Huh?    They're chasingas fast as they can...    But they'll never catch me.    Stay calm. Gotta stay calm...    Looks like you can barely move now.    You won't be able tochase me anymore.    You think so?    I know these roadsbetter than you do.    Look behind you.    It's a pincer att*ck!    We've finally cornered you.    Now, at the last moment,the tables have turned!    A pincer att*ck?    You still don't get it.    You think you've cornered me,but it's you two who are cornered.    Look above you!    High voltage power lines!    Crap! Power lines are...    That's right.Power lines are magnetic.    You'll burn to a crisp!    Magician's Red!    Hermit Purple!    Avdol can defend himselfwith his flames, just barely,    but you have no chance, Joestar.    My Bast's power is far greater...    than your Hermit Purple's!    Woman, my flames will roast you!    Something's pulling me!My whole body's being pulled!    What is this?    I control flamesthat can melt steel,    but I can't defendmyself from this...    My body is being crushed!    I can't keep this up!    Joseph Joestar,since this is the end, I'll tell you...    You were quite amazing.    We've only known each otherfor a few minutes,    but you are witty and canny,and your experience gives you    the good judgmentthat young people lack.    You've gotvery charming looks, too.    Our ages are quite far apart,    but I might not have mindedbeing with you.    That's great...    Would you mind saving me, then?    Hmm...    You're a lot more powerfulthan my Hermit Purple!    I can't hold on much longer...Please. Stop the magnetism!    Well...    Nah, I don't think so.    You're nowhere near as charmingas Lord Dio.    Is there nothing that willconvince you to stop the magnetism?    No, not happening.Sorry, but you have to die.    Even though I'm begging you?    You're much too persistent,you fool.    Then you've lost, young lady.    What?    Shi--    We told you this wasa pincer att*ck!    Magnets are attractedto each other.    Once you were between us,your luck ran out.    She can't hear you, Mr. Joestar.It looks like she's passed out.    She's been crushed bythe weight and magnetic force.    I'm sure she's brokenmore than a few bones.    Now, then...Shall we go get some breakfast?    Certainly. I'm rather hungryafter all that running around.    It's already  :   a.m.    sh*t-eating b*tches...    MARIAHBAST    ALL BONES BROKEN,ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL.     UNABLE TO RECOVER.(MUST RETIRE)     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    They're taking forever...    What the hell are they doing?    They're taking longer thana woman getting dressed.    It's almost  :   a.m.    They might haveencountered an enemy.    Maybe we should go look for them.    Yeah. Good grief.    Come on, Iggy.    I know, you're hungry, right?    So am I.    Mariah is fighting withJoestar and Avdol.    I, Alessi, shall k*llJotaro and Polnareff.    Now, little boy.    Come with me to the bathroomand take off your clothes.    Well done.    I'll help you take them off.    -Well done.-I'll apply some ointment.    Well done.    Is this really okay?    Well done...
