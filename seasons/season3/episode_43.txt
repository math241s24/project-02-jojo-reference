02x43 - The Miasma of the Void, Vanilla Ice, Part 2 / The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:58What the hell is that?  Why didn't Avdol's flames sense it?  Where are you, Avdol?  Avdol...  has been disintegrated.He is dead.  You two are next.  Your arrogance will not last.  One by one, each in his place,  I shall strew your atomic fragmentsacross the void.   It's impossible...   Avdol can't be dead.   You lie!   What?   Polnareff's Standcan att*ck this swiftly?   And at such distances? Astonishing.   Look over here,you good-for-nothing maggot!    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART      What was that?    When we broke through the mirage,   I think I heard a wall collapsedeep in the mansion.   Do you think Avdol and Polnareff...   Damn it! I know I hit him,but he's not dead.   He cannibalized himselfinto the abyss.   He and his Stand!   Avdol... Damn it.   You said it yourself.   Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!   You told us to look outfor ourselves.   You said you wouldn't save me.   You liar!   You've been meddlingin other people's business   ever since we set foot in India!   Avdol! Why couldn't youjust leave me alone?   If I hadn't ducked just now,I'd be a dead man.   It's fate;something's telling me to carry on.   Avdol must be telling meto fight back.   This room is way too dangerous.   We've got to get out of here, Iggy!   Come on, Iggy! Upstairs!   We're going upstairs!   The exit!That's the door we came in!   But I can't leave.   Avdol sacrificed himselfto save us.   Because he believed in us,that we can defeat Dio.   I can't... I won't let him down!   I refuse to turn backlike some coward.   I'm not running away.   I'm running to get closer to Dio!   And these stairs aren'tgoing to slow me down!   I expected himto dash out the door.   Such a pity...   Impressive. He managed a hit.   Polnareff's mental fortitudeemboldens him   to conquer his own fearsand face immanent death.   I shall corner himand obliterate his body.   There is no question.   He is no match for my Stand.   His Stand's jaws are the gatewayto an alternate dimension?   A dark, unimaginable abyss...   All I know is that he can move aboutour realm without making a sound,   without leaving the faintestscent or sign of life.   But how...   How can I b*at him?   He cut us off!   He's close.   He's here!   Iggy, watch my back!   I'll watch yours.   He can't reach usif he can't break through the wall.   As long as he emergesfrom the dark beyond,   I can k*ll him.   Come at me, bastard!I'll slice you in two!   You've got me pissed, which makesmy Chariot all the faster!   I've lost Avdol,and I'm not letting you get away!   What? He's hiding in the cr*ckunder my foot?   Chariot!   My foot!   That was so...   you can't run away!   Bastard!   Not so fast.   Mister Joestar!It's that shaking again!   It has to be Avdol and Polnareff.   They've come in after us,and they're fighting somewhere.   Come on!We have to find them, fast!   You've managedto hide amid the chaos, Polnareff.   Such futility.   With that injury, you won't go far.   You must be hidingbeneath the rubble.   You are helpless against me.You shall die by my hand.   Now, where are you, Polnareff?   That's quite the ruckus, Cool Ice.   Lord Dio!   Take heed, my lord!   Polnareff and that mongrelare hiding nearby.   Allow me to be of assistance.   You must not trouble yourself.   A fake Dio made from The Fool!We got him!   Attacking from behindmight be cowardly.    You'd think I'd feel guilty.    But you k*lled Avdol from behind.    I'll show you no mercy!    This is the death you deserve!    Do it, Iggy!    Quarter the bastard,shoulder to hip!    Fillet that scoundrel!    You're kidding!He figured it out!    The sun enters this room.    Lord Dio would never...    enter this room by day.    Iggy!    The real Lord Diobestowed me with his trust.    He entrusted mewith the honor of k*lling you.    That is why Lord Dio would never descendto the second floor!    No! He's going to k*ll Iggy!    He'll be swallowed upinto the abyss!    You damn, pathetic dog!    How dare you force meto destroy Lord Dio's likeness?    What? He punched him!    He didn't use the void!    He punched Iggywithout k*lling him!    Do you have any idea...    I don't care if it was a fakemade of sand!    You made me destroy it!    I'll kick you to death,you filthy mutt!    It would take only an instantto absorb you into my dark abyss!    That won't satiate my fury!    It's your fault!    It's your faultfor making me angry!    It's your fault!    Time to learn your lesson!How's that?    I'll teach you!And this? Better?    Stop...    Cool Ice is crazy.    He's insane!    He's lost it becausehe destroyed that pile of sand    that looked like Dio?    His soul is the murky abyss!    His soul is the inky hellthat obliterates all!    Lord Dio said    the resolve of the human heartmust never be underestimated.    But you're just a filthy stray!    You have no resolve.    Your soul knowsnothing of pride!    Stop...    Take that! And that!    Stop...    How do you like that? And that?    Stop it, Cool Ice!    I will end this, Polnareff!    sh*t!    He disappeared!    But...    Iggy!    Our Stand decoymay've fallen through,    but your sandmight've just saved us.    Now I know how to find him!    I can see him.I can see him moving!    How do you like that! We did it!    Damn you!    When you move,    you have to absorbeverything in your path.    So swallow this!    Take a big mouthful of sandand come here, you piece of sh*t!    And when you peek outfrom behind your Stand's putrid teeth,    I'll finish you off!    Bull's-eye! Yeah!Eat that!    I found your weakness, Cool Ice!    Your attempt to pinpoint my locationleaves you vulnerable!    You can't see me without emergingfrom your dark dimension!    Suck on this!    Suck on my sword and croak, bastard!    You bastard...    I've skewered your throatand your brain stem!    Die, damn it!You're supposed to be dead!    Hurry up and die!    Die, Cool Ice!    I cannot die.    I do not have time to feel pain.    I will k*ll you without fail!    I will swallow Iggy,the Joestars, and anyone left!    I can die after that!    You bastard!    Good boy.You've withdrawn your sword.    This time, I'll send you to hell!    Is this the vile armthat stabbed me?    You bastard!    Damn it! I had no choicebut to shove him away!    No!    Not so fast, buddy!    I got him! But...    Damn it! He got my leg.I can't move.    But I can't think about the pain!    I almost got him!    This guy is different.    He's vengeful to the core.    And he's not just nuts.    He's consumedwith devotion to Dio!    I won't let him get the upper hand!    I can't die until I k*ll you!    Damn him! Here he comes!    Take this!    It's no use.It got part of my sword!    It's impossible to att*ck himwhen he's hidden in the abyss.    It'll just swallow me whole.    He's absorbing the buildingat random! Damn it!    The bastard knows I'll att*ck himif he shows himself.    So he's blindly attackingfrom every angle!    He's good.    At this rate,he'll hit me for sure.    I have to pull back Chariot.    Damn it...Iggy's losing too much blood.    His broken ribsmust've punctured his lungs.    Talk about insane...He's devouring the walls.    No... I was wrong!    This isn't random.It's all part of his plan!    He's drawing circles around me,smaller, concentric circles!    He's making a spiral.    Like a giant mosquito coil.He's closing in!    It doesn't matterif he doesn't know our location.    He doesn't haveto break out of the abyss.    He'll hit us anyway!    He's got usright where he wants us.    There's no wayI can dodge him with this leg!    I've got to carve an openingin the floor to get away!    Damn.I don't have enough time!    He's coming right for us!    Somehow I dodged...    But he's closing inlike a needle on a record.    In about five more rounds,he'll be here!    The question is...    How do I dodgewith this injured leg?     SELECT THE BEST ANSWERFROM THE FOLLOWING THREE OPTIONS:      . THE HANDSOME POLNAREFF WILL DEVISE     THE PERFECT COUNTERATTACKJUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.      . HIS FRIENDS WILLCOME AND SAVE HIM.      . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DODGE THE att*ck.LIFE IS A BITCH.    If it were up to me,option two would become my reality.    But I can't count on that.    They entered the mansionten minutes before us.    There's no waythey'll just appear out of thin air    like some American comic book hero,swooping in to save the day.    For all I know, they might bein the middle of a fight themselves.    Looks like option oneis my only choice.    Chariot! Pull me out of the circleas fast as you can!    Damn it! Pull me faster!    It's no use!    Damn! So it's option three.    Life is a bitch.    Silver Chariot is a Standthat fights with a saber.    It doesn't have the powerto pull my weight,    especially when I'm injured.    Blast it...    You're all torn up!Just stay still, stupid!    If you moveor use your Stand's power,    your broken ribs will sink deeperinto your lungs and you'll die!    Just cut out the tough-guy act,you idiot!    Are you trying to die beside me?    I'm the onewho's going to save you!    You have to live on    to tell Mister Joestar and the othersabout this bastard.    You have to defeat him!    Avdol might've saved me,but you sure as hell better not!    If we all die,everything will be in vain!    One more loop and he's got me.    So it is number three.    Life is cruel.    Guess he wanted victorymore than I did.    So long, Iggy.    This blood is not your doing.    It is Avdol's.    I don't know the details.    I have really bad luckwith friends.    Not to the likes of you!    It happens every time.
