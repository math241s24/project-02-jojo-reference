02x34 - D'Arby the Gambler, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:47What is that which goes onfour legs in the morning,  two at midday,and three in the evening?  So goes the riddle of the Sphinx,  the legendary guardianof the pyramids.  The answer: Man.  Those travelerswho answered incorrectly,  the tale continues, were devouredby the ravenous Sphinx.  Now   ,    kilometersfrom Japan,  Jotaro and crew havefinally reached Cairo.   Cairo is a vast country.   We must searchthe city systematically,   working our way in toward the center.   At last, we made it.   Jotaro and the othershave reached Cairo.   But before they can reach Dio,   the team must navigate the many"Sphinxes" that stand before them.   Greetings, strangers.What can I get you?   There's somethingwe want to ask you.   We're looking for this building.   Any idea where it is?   Joseph and the otherswere exhausted.   They had been searchingfor the building in the picture   since their arrival.   Taken with Joseph'spsychic photography,   the picture revealsthe current whereabouts of Dio.   Dio was now in a new hideout,   and the Speedwagon Foundationcould not locate him.   Where is Dio?   Failure to locate him soon,   will spell certain doom for Holly.   Honored stranger, this is a café.   It is customary to order drinksbefore asking questions.   We'll have four iced teas.   Never seen it.   Cairo is a city of six million.   There must be at leasttwo or three million buildings.   How are we going to find him?   We know he's here...   There has to be someonewho knows.   This building, huh?   How am I supposed to tellfrom a little picture?   Sorry, doesn't look familiar.   I see. Sorry to bother.   Humph.   Let's go. We'll inquire elsewhere.   I know where that building is.   -What?-What?   I'm rather familiar with it,actually.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE GAMBLER, PART      Was that you?Did you just say something?   I thought I heard you sayyou know where this building is.   Indeed.   I do know where that building is.   What? Really?   What news!   Yes! I can't believe we juststumbled upon someone   who knows where it is!   Where is it?Tell us! Where?   Are you expecting somethingfor nothing?   You've got a point.Sorry about that.   Here's ten pounds.   So, where is it?   I am a gambling man.   A sucker for cheap thrills.   You could even say I'm an addict.   It's how I make my living,you know.   Tell me... do you like to gamble?   I'm not sure what you're getting at.   Gambling. If you don't fancy it,just say so.   I told you I'm not surewhat you mean.   What I'm saying is, would you liketo play a little game?   If you win, I'll tell youthe location of your building.   You mean a bet?Look, I'm a lucky guy,   but we don't have timefor poker right now.   I'll give you another   pounds, so tell us.   A bet can be anything.   It won't take long.   For example,take a look over there.   See that cat?   So, two pieces of dried fish...   Which will the cat eat first?   The right one or the left one?   How about it?It's simple but oddly thrilling.   Enough games!   Just take the    pounds,and tell us, bastard!   Polnareff, that's not the wayyou ask someone for a favor.   OK, fine! I'll take the bet.   I pick the one on the right!   Good! Now it's getting fun.   Then I'll bet on the left.   Hey, now...   Hey, Jotaro. Are you thinkingwhat I'm thinking?   Yeah... He might be a Stand user.   He could also bea compulsive gambler.   If he tries anything,   att*ck with Star Platinum.   Got it.   And if I lose, what do I owe you?   A     pounds?    I don't need money.    How about your soul?Yes, your soul, will do just fine.    What?    What kind of joke is that?Cocky bastard.    I wish we couldget the hell out of here    and away from this freak.    So?    Yeah, whatever.    Ah, the cat has taken noticeof the fish.    He's heading right.    He's going for the oneon the right.    If I were a cat,I'd pick the bigger piece.    The one on the right looks bigger!    You all saw it.    He took the left, then the right,then ran.    I win.    Hey, smooth move, Polnareff.Just perfect...    Now how are we supposed toget the information out of him?    Now, then. As per our agreement,time to pay up.    Huh? Pay what?    Your soul.    That is indeedwhat you just wagered.    Your soul!    I am a Stand user who steals souls!    It's much easier to take people'ssouls when they lose a bet.    That's when my Stand swoops into take its prey!    My God! What the...    Polnareff!    Hold it! I wouldn't k*ll meif I were you. It's too late!    If I die, Polnareff will die, too!    Polnareff!    Hey!    He has no pulse.    He's dead! Polnareff is dead!    Polnareff!    This is Polnareff's soul.    Now Lord Dio has one less enemyto get in his way.    Such a fool...    I almost forgot.Allow me to introduce myself.    My name is D'Arby.    D-A-R-B-Y.There's an apostrophe after the D.    Gambler, stealer of defeated souls,    and user of the Osiris Stand.    And by the way, this is my cat.    You bastard!    How dare you! You call that a bet?You cheating, son of a...    Cheating?    Is that so? It's his own faultfor lacking the insight    to consider all possibilities.    You see, gambling is an analogy    for man's relationshipwith his fellow man.    It is a dance of deception.    The one who cries loses.    Are you going to k*ll me?    Go right ahead.    If you don't mind losingyour friend's soul, that is.    You listen to me!    Don't think you're walkingout of here alive!    Do you rememberwhat you were doing on    September   nd,     at   :   p.m.?    What are you talking about?    I remember quite clearly.    I was in California    gambling against an Americannamed Stephen Moor.    He said the same thingyou just said.    This is him.    The chip below him is his father,    and the one next to himis his wife.    If you want Polnareff's soul back,    you have no choicebut to continue    our little game.    This man is evil incarnate...    He's planning to take each of us,one by one.    So what'll it be?    You're welcome to goif you're scared...    I'll just keep Polnareff herefor safe keeping.    Here... have a drinkand think about it.    Care for a piece of chocolate?    Mr. Joestar, what are you doing?    Do you know whatsurface tension is, Barbie?    It's D'Arby.My name is D'Arby.    You mean, how the liquor appearsto almost overflow    but remains delicatelyon the brink?    What do you have in mind?    The rules are simple.    We take turns dropping coinsinto the glass.    Whoever makesthe liquor spill loses.    Hey, old man...    You can't mean... Mr. Joestar!    I'll bet my soul!     OSIRISD'ARBY ELDER    I'll bet my soul!    Good!    What?    This is insane! Don't!You know he cheats!    He can't cheat!    I decided the rules!    Jotaro, keep a close eye on himso he doesn't try anything funny.    OK! Fine, I accept.    But first...    Mind if I inspectthe glass and coins?    Of course.    You have the right tomake sure I'm playing fair.    A question.What guarantee do I have    that you will returnPolnareff's soul if you lose?    Gambler's honor.    If I lose, I assure you I will pay.But I will not lose.    Fine. You first.Go ahead and drop in a coin.    Mr. Joestar!    Leave this to me.    The old "coin and glass" trickis my specialty.    Surface tensionis surprisingly strong.    There's room for at leasteight or nine coins...    I just have to stay calm andmake sure my fingers don't shake.    May I drop in more than one coin?    Sure, as long asyou drop them in all at once.    Well, then...    Five coins?    Hey, that'll create a waveon the surface!    Quiet please!    Hands off the table.    It's your turn.    You've got nerves of steel,putting in five coins at once.    I'll go with one.    It's too close to call.    Typical...    He's squeezing a cotton ballbetween his finger and the coin,    and dripping liquid into the glass.    He's adding more liquidto the glass!    And he told me to watchfor cheating?    Clever bastard...    Not bad.    The glass has reached its limit!    One more coin andthe booze will spill! I win!    Just like he said,    it's not cheatingif you don't get caught!    That was a close one.I thought it was going to spill...    Your turn, Obi.    It's D'Arby.Don't make me say it again!    My name is D'Arby!    Not Obi, not Barbie!    Sorry.    He's screwing up his nameon purpose to piss him off.    The old man...    is a natural gambler.    Let's keep playing.    It's your turnto drop in a coin, D'Arby.    The shadow makes it difficultto see from here.    I'll drop in the coin fromthe right side of the table.    Drop it in from wherever you want.    The glass is already at its limit,thanks to my little trick.    There's no way the liquidcan take another coin.    It'll spill over with justthe slightest touch.    You're thinking the glasshas reached its limit.    That it's impossible, right?    Well, you're wrong...    Impossible! No!    Why didn't it spill!    What do you mean,why didn't it spill?    You saw for yourself,I dropped one in.    He made no suspicious moves.    I was watchingwith Star Platinum.    He dropped the coinin fair and square.    There's no doubt about it.    I was sure of it!    I was certainI added enough liquid    to make it spillwith one more coin!    I don't get it. There's no wayit couldn't have spilled!    How could this be?    Hurry up.    Or are you trying to waituntil it evaporates?    I can't believe it.    Mr. Joestar!    In his heart of hearts,Joestar realized he had lost!    That's why his soul emerged.    I, D'Arby, have won this bet!    Polnareff, forgive me.    Holly, I've let you down.    Mr. Joestar!    Old man!    Two down!    Now, then.Let's continue our game.    Unless you've decidedto abandon these two    and crawl off withyour tails between your legs.    You bastard!    You don't get it, do you?    If you k*ll me,your two friends die too.    Damn it!    Avdol, stop!    Hey! If you're going tocause trouble,    I'll have to ask you to leave!    Shut up and stay out of this!    Yes, sir!    You're too late, Jotaro.    Is something wrong withthe glass?    This is why the coin didn't makethe booze spill over.    There's a tiny bit of chocolateon the bottom of the glass.    He must have stuck it onwhen he inspected    the glass and coins atthe beginning of the game.    You know the rules.    It's not cheatingif you're never caught.    What do you mean?    How could a piece of chocolateallow him to drop in an extra coin?    It's melted now,    but it was a solid chunk atthe bottom of the glass.    Just enough toslightly tilt the glass,    but not enough for us to notice.    Once it melted,the glass became level,    making room for another coin.    What?    But...    How could he have knownthe chocolate    would melt at that exact moment?    He used the sun.    It slipped my notice.    When he moved tothe right side of the table,    he allowed the sun to shinedirectly onto the chocolate,    thereby melting it.    All right,    D'Arby,    get your cards.    We're playing poker.    Jotaro!    Very interesting!    Poker is my absolute favorite!     Poker? This is a manwho just outsmarted Mr. Joestar!     It's too dangerous!     I know, he's tough.     He may not use strength,    but he's the most dangerous Standwe've ever faced.    Well...    There's no turning back.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    -Draw three.-I'll draw two.    He's not doing anything suspicious,and yet...    Cheating is all about findinga mental blind spot.    There's only one joker.    Well, then, Jotaro...    Very well. I'll wager my soul.
