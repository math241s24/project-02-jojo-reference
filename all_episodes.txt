This poor bloke's a goner.The horses lost balance on the muddied slope and fell here.This one here appears as a real nobleman.Even d*ed with a smile.Dario! The woman inside the carriage passed, but her baby's still alive! She must have passed in its stead.Leave it! Babies aren't worth a single quid! Dario, what are you doing?! Robbing the dead, woman! Take anything that looks noble! A case? That's an eerie mask.Toss it.Woman, lend a hand! Pull their front teeth out and we'll take it to the jawsmith's! They'll fetch for fine coin! S-Sir Good sir, was it you who salvaged me? You have my gratitude.Mary Where are my wife and son? How do they fare, good sir? She diâ No, I'm afraid your wife passed, and the driver as well.However, the baby fares well.Wrought with woe, I am I am Joestar, good sir.I shall be indebted to you for our salvation.Do give your name, before I lapse into slumber once more.The toff believes me to be his savior! The fool! He shall know me as his savior! Lord Joestar, I am Dario Brando.Mr.Brando I shall never forget my debt to you.Good boy! Father, I'll be off! Watch for carriages, Jojo! Danny, come! Dio! Come to me, son! Dio! Come to my side! What do you want? Medicine? Don't be a ninny! The medicine does nothing for me! Whiskey! Use your quid on the whiskey, not medicine! Jojo, table manners.Forgive me, Father.Checkmate.Take it and shove it up yer arse, laddie! Return my doll to me, now! Come and get it! Come now, Erina! Did yer daddy buy you this doll? He's a damn mountebank, but makes good coin! What do you say we have ourselves a look-see underneath? Will it look the same as a real lass's? We made her cry! Crybaby, crybaby! Erina's a crybaby! Enough! I'm taking her doll back! What's it to you, chap? Do you know her?! No, but a true gentleman assists any lady in need! You tosser Trying to impress her, are we?! My, this chap's a wee bit on the brittle side.Pathetic, I say! You failed to impress the lassie! He's the heir to that toff nobleman, George Joestar! I bear the wealthy no grudge, but I do despise them! Don't you dare belittle commoners! Take this! Dio, I don't have much longer.I just know it.When I'm gone, send this letter to George Joestar, and go live with him.The bloke's indebted to me.Dio, you're a cunning boy! Study under George Joestar, and you'll be the richest gent around! Keep yer wealthy arse inside yer damn estate.Let's leave.A-Are you Please, don't tend to me! Leave me be! I did not exchange blows to earn your gratitude! I strive to be a true gentleman.True gentlemen defend the honor of any lady in need.Though I knew prior that I would not emerge the victor, true gentlemen stake their bravery to defend any in need.One day, I shall emerge as the victor.You made my mother suffer until the day she passed, you loathsome, deceitful, putrid scum.You want me to be richest gent around? I will, but not for you.I shall use anyone and anything I can to meet that end.Including this nobleman, George Joestar.Damned pissant! For my sake, I shall be the best.Jonathan Joestar This bizarre adventure encompasses the lives of two boys whose fates are twisted and intertwined by a mysterious stone mask.Episode Dio the Destroyer Who is he? Wait, you must be Dio Brando.Which makes you Jonathan Joestar.Yes, but everyone calls me "Jojo." I hope we can be friends.Danny! Dio, meet Danny.He's my loyal friend.Oh, and don't worry.Danny never bites.Wh-What did you do that for?! He did nothing to you! So, he's the heir to the Joestar Estate.Indeed, he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.If I can break his spirit over time, then taking over as heir to the estate will be What's going on here?! Are you fighting? Apologies, sir.I reacted instinctively when the dog leapt onto me.Welcome home, Dio.Henceforth, you are a part of the Joestar's.Servants, Dio is the son of the man who saved both Jojo and I.Treat him as you would Jojo.Very well, Lord Joestar.Dio, you may treat this estate as your own.Lord Joestar, you have my utmost gratitude.Like yourself, Jojo's mother has passed on.And both of you are 12 years of age.Be good to each other.And Jojo, forgive Dio for kicking Danny.Okay.I too would've been shocked if another dog had done the same.It's water under the bridge.An apology from Dio would have sufficed, but I want to be good friends with him now that we're living together.Dio, follow me.I'll show you to your room.Yes, sir.What are you doing? Never touch my things, ever.Keep your filthy hands off my belongings, you tosser! I was only trying to help-! I need no help! I'll have a servant carry it.Listen well, Jojo.I'm going to be trouble in your life, so let's clear one thing.I adore being the best! Being number one! And I won't let anyone take that from me! Why would you do that?! I want to be friends! Another thing.I despise dogs.Not due to fear, but because their subserviant nature sickens me! So keep your damn mutt away from me.What are you both doing? Do come up.Yes sir! From the moment Dio set foot on the Joestar estate, Jojo's joyful life began to diminish into anguish.Incorrect again, Jojo! Dio's is perfect! He answered all twenty problems correctly! Jojo, you dare strive to be a gentleman, yet you have no table manners! Remove Jojo's tableware.You are excused from dinner tonight! Until Dio arrived, I've been spoiling you rotten! I am ashamed to have not realized it sooner! Dio has perfect table manners in comparison! Buffoon.Ladies and gentlemen, up next is Jonathan Joestar! He's grown some brawn recently.His opponent has been changed.The newcomer to town and Jojo's new friend, I-Is that Dio Brando, will be his opponent! Gentlemen, the first to land one clean punch to the face wins.Box! b*at him, Jojo! In the face! How can he dodge those punches?! I've never seen such swift movements! W-Why can't I hit him?! Jojo has good control and force in his punches.No matter I want you to taste the boxing techniques of rookery rogues! Savor it! We have a winner! Jojo loses! But I'm not done with you yet, Jojo.I'm going follow through this punch, by gouging your eye with my thumb! D-Dio's incredible! Dio! Dio, your technique's quite refined! How did you b*at Jojo? I simply used a new defensive technique.I could teach everyone how to use it.Really? Only if you keep it secret from Jojo.He's the kind of chap who'd telltale anything.He is?! I had no idea! Why would you even say something like that?! A man bereft of friends is a social outcast.But I shall cast Jojo as a leper.I shall take away everything he possesses.And when I am favored as the heir, everything he owned shall be mine! Damn Dio I'm miserable.It's as if he's destroying my life Laddies, let's make haste! Where are you off to? Why don't you come up and join me? Anyone hear the voice of a tosser? Pay it no heed.He's a telltale who'll tell everyone else.What did you call me?! Stay there! Who's a telltale?! Let's be off.You're a telltale, Jojo! You can't keep anything a secret, not from anybody! You stupid git! Come back this instant! When have I ever failed to keep a secret?! Jojo's a telltale! Dio It was Dio! Dio's feeding them lies, and it's spreading like the plague! It's as if Dio's been trying to destroy my reputation from the beginning! Damn you, Dio! Dio! Dio, Dio DIO! Ever since he came, Dio's made my life Hell I need someone to talk to Danny.Dio could never turn you against me, right? Who could that have been? I could swear I've seen her before My handkerchief! I see! Thank you kindly for the grapes! I'll be here tomorrow as well, so stop by if you can! She left without saying a single word.Girls like that are such sweethearts.Romance! It thoroughly engaged Jojo's youthful curiosity.Neither of them had any friends to say, and Jojo quickly grew attached to his sweetheart.Her name's Erina Erina Pendleton.She's cute as a button! Jojo, are you carving out a picture? You're so naughty! Bad Jojo! Good night! Bye! Evenin'.Might you be Erina? You seem awful friendly with Jojo.It was k*lling me.How he could be happy after everything I've done to him? H-He did it! Daring Dio! He may do all what we would never dare to! I have nothing but admiration for so daring a chap! You haven't kissed Jojo yet, have you? You haven't, have you? How fortunate that your first kiss wasn't with Jojo, but with me, Dio! No matter the method, the result remains relevant.I was the one who kissed her, not Jojo! Now, she can't bear to face Jojo anymore.I will see that he never he makes any friends again! D-Dio! Wh-What is she doing! What's wrong with her?! She's washing her mouth with muddy water! How could she do that to herself?! There's a creek nearby she could've used! Y-You bitch! How dare you wash away my kiss in defiance! Curses! I lost my patience to a mere girl! Enough! We leave.Hello Erina! Erina, wait! She's avoiding me Did something happen? Chaps, Jojo appears indubitably perplexed! Do you want to tell him the reason for Erina's avoidance? No, good sir.I do not want to see his tears.Y-You curs What did you do to Erina?! Dio!!! You will address me by my full name, Jojo! You've gone too far this time! I can tolerate anything you do to me! In fact, I don't care what you do to me! I take it you've heard about my kissing your sweetheart.And you'd fancy fisticuffs in retaliation, is that it? I will not forgive you for tainting her honor! A man wrought with jealousy is no man! Would you care for another eye-gouging? You damn buffoon! H-He's too skilled but if I don't take a stand, I'll be living in fear of his very shadow! Moreover, I must restore Erina's honor I must stand and fight! I'll b*at him into a bloody pulp in a gentlemen's duel.When Jojo realizes that he cannot defeat me, he will fear me, and I shall teach him so! I shall best him in everything! En garde! Yes! I can taste victory! Y-You used my kick as an opening to seize my head?! Well then, let me kick you again-! Dio! How I'll b*at you could until your tears flow! I be struck by this scum! H-How dare you How dare you How dare you strike me! You're crying You goddamned buffoon! Boys, what's going on?! Father! Boys may have an occasional exchange of fists, but you, Jojo, appear to be assaulting a defenseless Dio! An aspiring gentleman would do no such deed! Y-You're wrong, Father! Enough, Jojo! Both of you, go to your quarters! I shall discipline you both later! What's this box doing here? Rubbish, I suppose.Another maid's doing, no doubt.Wh-What's that sound? Is that banging?! I-Is there somebody inside the furnace?! Good heavens! They're being b*rned alive! Erina Damn you, Dio! Your damned kiss forced a wedge between Erina and I! I can't even call out to her! Danny's remains were far too gruesome to have you witness.Ergo, I had him buried posthaste.The authorities believe a thief may have trapped Danny in that box during a robbery attempt Dio Lord Dio? I believe Lord Dio is presently at the academy.Jojo returned to his quarters, and slept for two hours.Shortly after he awoke, he came to accept Danny's passing, and wept.I've redeemed my humiliation by disposing of the mutt, but at least I know of Jojo's true strength.A grave miscalculation on my end.He quickly learns from his mistakes, and I pride my confidence in excess.I shall mend this error by learning to control my emotions and demeanor, lest another blunder occur.Seven years have passed since that duel.I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Seven years have passed! Jonathan Joestar has caught the ball! A most terrifying thought occurred to me just now! You don't care if you lose your fingers, do you?! Doubt me, and we won't be friends! I shall defend my father and the Joestar Estate! Episode A Letter from the Past
01x02 - A Letter From the PastQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:42Seven years have passed! The year is now 1888.On this year, London would be terrorized by an unknown serial k*ller dubbed Jack the Ripper whose primary victims consisted of Whitechapel prostitutes.But this year of terror did not belong to Jack alone.On this very year, the feud between Jojo and Dio would be rekindled! Once, there were two sh**ting stars descending from Heaven, Sora kobore ochita futatsu no hoshi ga Hikari to yami noãminamo suikomareteyuku flying straight into an ocean of emotion.hikiauyouni takanaru hamon And from their impact, a ripple of strife exploded! hokori no michi wo yukumono ni taiyou no michibiki wo One lead the path of pride under guidance from the Sun, hokori no michi wo yukumono ni taiyou no michibiki wo One lead the path of pride under guidance from the Sun, while the other strove for unbound ambition yabou no hate wo mezasu mono ni ikenie wo no matter the cost.furueru hodo kokoro moetsukiru hodo atsuku The star of the Sun, unwavering, burning with vigor, sono te kara hanate kodou radiates a courageous flame karada minagiru yuuki de engulfing its entire being! mayoi naki kakugo ni gassai wo Both stars ready to collide sono chi no sadame for it's in the blood of all JoJos! A Letter from the Past Episode And a catch! Jonathan Joestar, the star of Hugh Hudson Academy, has caught the ball! Usually, he stands as a silent giant with a stature of 195 centimeters! But now this giant is now bellowing his way towards the goal! This will be his final rugby match before graduation! Can he graduate with a victory?! Joestar's been tackled! But he stands stout! He takes two more tackles! Joestar's being held down by all three! Incredible! Joestar continues to the goal as the three struggle to hold him down! With brawn and bollocks, he's an unstoppable steam-locomotive! We have a fourth tackle! Joestar's starting to sag! It's a pass and catch! The catcher is Dio! Dio Brando, the pride of Hugh Hudson Academy, has the ball! Can he slip through?! A slip! Another slip! He's done it! A one-man sprint to the goal! My, how graceful he sprints! It's a Try! He's done it! Hugh Hudson Academy has won the final game of the graduating class! Jojo and Dio made a brilliant pair! Perfect synchronization! We did it, Jojo! Your one-man sprint was marvelous, Dio! Thank you, but I couldn't have done it without you! Dio Brando will graduate with the highest marks in Common Law.Jonathan Joestar, however, will graduate with an outstanding thesis in Archaeology! We couldn't have won this game without either of them! They're both stars of Hugh Hudson Academy! Jojo, we should hurry home and tell Father about our victory.Indeed.How long has it been since Dio started addressing my father as "Father," and not "Lord Joestar?" We may seem like a pair of chums, but our friendship feels strangely superficial.Why is it? He can be very pleasant, but I feel nothing but mistrust for him.Even after seven years! Dio, could you comment on your chumship with Jojo for the school paper? Our friendship? The words escape me.Please Dio.We'd love to hear about it too.Very well "Friendship?" You sods can take those pens and shove them up yer arses! I'll graduate soon.I no longer require the aid of George Joestar.I've bode this seven-year farce with Jojo long enough.Succession is nearly at hand! I will inherit the Joestar Estate.I am now of the age when I may legally receive any inheritance! Father, how do you fare? I fare well, my son.Though, this confounded cough won't cease.A doctor recommended I admit myself to a hospital.A hospital? On the contrary, Father.The greedy doctor must know that hospitals are environmental reservoirs.I declined the suggestion myself.I feel most comfortable within my estate.The pain in my chest and swelling in my digits have gone as well.I feel at ease.Father only had a case of the common cold.Why were his chest and digits affected too? Also, Dio and Jojo, congratulations on your victory.You knew? A friend from the university paid me a visit earlier.How could they spoil it? We hurried home to surprise you with the news as well.I am overjoyed, boys.I'm very proud of you both, my talented boys.I heard about your dashing sprint as well, Dio.Once you've graduated, you may pursue what you may.If you need monetary assistance, my son, then you shall have it.I am utterly indebted to you for my upbringing, among other things.I shall not disappoint you.I'm the only one who knows of blood's effect on this mask.I wonder what use its creator intended for, when contacted with blood? Nevertheless, I am attached to this mask.It belonged to my dear mother.Perhaps this stone mask will become a grand phenomenon after I unravel its mysteries and publish everything I know about it? Drat! Lord Dio, you don't always have to do this Please.My apologies, but these old legs just can't handle the old staircase anymore.A most terrifying thought occurred to me just now! Dio Dio is! Dio! Where is the original prescription? It's on this tray.Do you always take medicine to Father, instead of the butler? As a matter of fact, I do.Moments ago, I came upon the letter your father wrote to mine.It follows: "I am ill and bedridden."I'll be passing soon."I just know I will "I know not this sickness, "but my chest hurts, my fingers swell, and I cough without end." My father's symptoms match your father's! Explain yourself, Dio! What are you insinuating? I shall examine that prescription! Jojo, examining that means you'll be doubting our friendship.Doubt me, and we won't be chums! His glare made me avert my eyes! I may have suspicions, but I'm not certain that he even is the culprit! Jojo return the prescription to the tray.Do that, I will forget that you ever doubted our friendship.Dio! On Dario Brando's honor, swear a gentleman's word of your innocence! This, alone, will suffice! Swear on your father's honor, and I will return this to the tray and apologize for ever doubting you! If my suspicions are proper, Dio's pride won't allow him to lower himself so! Dio! A gentleman's word, now! A-A word, is it? You want me to swear on his honor?! You know nothing! That pissant never had a shred of honor about him! Dio, now I'm convinced that you're the culprit.Your hatred and spite for your father are profound.Indeed, I know nothing of your relationship with Dario Brando, but I do know that you m*rder*d him! I shall defend my father and the Joestar Estate! Y-You're trying to k*ll me? Dio, your seven-year scheme is evident to me! No longer shall you flout of an imaginary friendship between us! No longer shall you approach my father! I shall conduct an analysis of this poison and see that you are thrown into Newgate, or worse! Curses I was only centimeters away from the inheritance! Was finding that letter just a sick coincidence? No! I won't have my ambition halted by that sod! Yer mum's dress will fetch for fine coin! My mother suffered until her death.The very thought of being that pissant's son sends me bedlam! Whiskey! Whiskey, now! But now, there's no turning back! Father, I'll be away in London for two or three days.Until I return, I ask that you seek care from these doctors, and no others.Have you no faith in our services, Lord Jojo? He does.But I ask you to trust Jojo.Though I know not of his reasons, my son has my trust as well.F-Father His symptoms have worsened.I need an antidote.Jojo will take three days to return with any evidence of that poison.I'll need him dead before he returns.And what better way than to make it appear accidental? Seven years ago, my blood coaxed spines from this mask.If these spines were embedded into his skull, it'd be fatal.With Jojo, it'd become an "experiment gone awry." The authorities wouldn't suspect my hand in his death! Jojo, your research will be your undoing! I couldn't distinguish the poison's components, not even in a university laboratory.It must have come from the Orient.The rookery Good sir, the only street around here is "Ogre Street," the most foul and violent street in all of London.I am aware.Nevertheless, I seek a resident of this street.You may leave.Dio once lived in London, and the only rookery one may acquire oriental medicine is Ogre Street! Once I locate the proprietor, I shall attain the antidote and evidence I require! Another dead end By George! That cat was eating a pup! Tatty, lead the way! Aye! Flay that toff's skin off, and we'll tan it into a hide! "Ogre Street," indeed.I see three foul ogres already.Blimey, is this toff thick?! He's got my blade in his hand! But if I pull back on me blade, you'll lose yer fingers! Then pull! You pull, and my Log Legs will crush your crotch! I'll do a son's duty, even if I lose my fingers! I will fight to defend my father and estate! My cause is not akin to the greed of you rogues! Chinaman! Answer me this.Where can I find an oriental apothecary? You sod! You don't care if you lose yer fingers, aye?! Aye?! Then you'd best mean everything you say, my toff chum! Here I come! Throw anything you want! I shall overcome any and all obstacles! Yer a naive little toff who's never been in a real tussle! Yer head's not the only vital part of the body! I heard my bowler hat strike bone! I couldn't get yer body 'cause of that Kn*fe, but I still did you a lot of damage! Wh-What a kick! H-He really doesn't care if he loses more than his fingers! He doesn't falter neither to fear or pain! I shouldn't have tussled with this toff Not with any as solid as this sod! What? Jojo ventured into Ogre Street, alone? I tried to persuade him not to go Keep this to yourself, and especially from Lord Joestar.I suppose I won't need the mask now Jojo is already a dead man.The buffoon C-Cease! I, Speedwagon, shall allow none to harm this gentleman! "Gentleman?" You answer me this! Why didn't you use yer full strength? Yer Log Legs could've smote me to smithereens! As I ventured here for the sake of my father, I withheld my strength when I thought of your own families.I desire not to be cursed by another father as a m*rder*r! He is a thick toff! Never have I seen so foolish and naive a sod as he! Still He hasn't dealt a mortal blow to them.This sod has the mouth and mind of a true gentleman! I'm intrigued! Let me have yer name.It's Jonathan Joestar.Very good, Jonathan Joestar! You're searching for an oriental apothecary, aye? Be wary of him! He's a sneaky bugger! It's been three days and Lord Jojo hasn't returned.He'll return when his business is finished.He may not have been alike Lord Dio in youth, but he has become a fine man.On that note, I was much stricter with him.Three days have passed.Jojo better be dead! Perhaps he survived and found him Why am I drowning myself in whiskey?! How could I practice the pastime of that pissant?! Dammit all! Watch it! Get off the street, you drunk sod! Chumsford, tell me, did that little sod get sh*t on my coat? Did ya hear the gent, you little sod?! My mouth! You dirty cur! You hurt my chum, you did! My, my Swine akin to my putrid pissant of a father dare to talk back to one as noble as myself?! Very well! I believe I'll make you adorn this before Jojo! Speak English, you g*dd*mn sod! You're my guinea pig! Wh-What is this incandescence?! Was there light, or was that the whiskey? He's dead.How monotonous.The damn mask is just a t*rture device! It couldn't be He's alive! What's wrong with his face?! Fangs?! H-He sent me flying?! He's still coming How can he not be in pain from that slash?! A minor flesh wound, but my collarbone is broken! I must swim away! Thirsty Won't you be a good lad, and quench my thirst? He's sucking my blood! His face! I now know the true function of the stone mask! B-But! Goddammit! The last thing I'll live to see is that blasted sun! I-It was the sunlight Servants! Why are the lights not lit?! Jojo?! I have you now, Dio! I have evidence of your fiendish plot! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Jojo, won't you hear my plea?

Episode A Youth with Dio I've attained the antidote and had it administered to my father.Dio I am wrought by grief, my brother, that I must now have you placed into the custody of Scotland Yard.I grieve for you.Dio I truly grieve for you, for these turn of events, for everything.You're a true gentleman, always have been.Jojo, won't you hear my plea? My final plea.Won't you allow me a respite? I shall surrender myself in good time! My word I believed he would've lashed out in anger instead of pleading! Jojo you actually returned alive from that rookery! I'm at my wit's end Ease for a moment, and I shall behead you! I regret everything! Every single thing! My petty ambition for riches festered like a disease from my poor upbringing! I know I've done wrong! I shouldn't have poisoned your father over the inheritance! I've returned to surrender myself, Jojo! Were I to have fled, I would've done so without facing your judgment! I-Indeed I wish to face justice Dio That's close enough, Mr.Joestar.I've never heard a fibber as grand as this bloke.Where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself.The name's Speedwagon, Speedwagon the Sneak.Out of concern, I accompanied Mr.Joestar back from Ogre Street.Mr.Joestar, yer a naive and merciful gent, so allow me a sneak.I was bred in the rookery, and smelled me fair share of cheats and churls, so I know me stenches of scoundrels and stinkers real well, see.This sod's a real stinker! He reeks of a shitter, he does! Never before have I heard a sod spew as much sh*t as he! He blames his daddy for a poor rearing, aye? Nay, I say! The cur was born a stinker! Stinker, tell me, does this bugger's face ring any bells?! The apothecary acknowledges to have sold you poison.I heard everything.My ears are aflame, Dio.I had intended nothing but affection toward you, as I had Jojo.Father, you have not fully recovered yet Aye I shall return to my chambers.I wish not to witness the apprehension of my son.Jojo, do what must be done.Yes sir.I suppose this really is the end of the line The boy shan't be taken with ease.He possesses the mark of the Three Star Gods and a face of ambition The boy was born blessed with grand fortune.Jojo Won't you be the one to cuff me? My brief brother of seven years Very well.Mr.Joestar, be careful Jojo, the apex of human potential is so limited If there's one thing I've learned in my life of 19 years, it's that the grander a human scheme is, the simpler it is for unforeseen factors to thwart.Therefore, I shall become grander than a human.What do you refer to? Speak sense! I shall cease to be human, Jojo! I shall transcend all of humanity Why do you have the stone mask?! Mr.Joestar! Constables, open fire! with your blood, Jojo! N-No Father!!! Open fire! Jojo F-Father I could've avoided the thrust, but I was taken aback by my mother's memento And you took his thrust for me Take this ring It was your mother's No, Father! The Kn*fe hit an organ! Dammit all! How could I have let this happen?! Lord Joestar should've heed my words from years ago! His death is my doing! I should've sent Dio's father to a penal colony, regardless! His father?! Shortly after I joined Scotland Yard, I was tasked with the case of a man attempting to sell that very ring to a pawnbroker! That man was Dario Brando, Dio Brando's father! This is my wedding ring My wife and I had a pair made for betrothal We apprehended the thief, Brando, before he could sell it.Brando?! Dario Brando was Lord Joestar's savior.But the scoundrel didn't save him! He merely happened upon Lord Joestar's carriage, and stole what he could! I-It's him! Did Mr.Brando tell you that I gave him the ring? Indeed, he did! And what a fib it was! No, Constable, he spoke the truth.I gave him the ring.I-I beg your pardon?! He is an innocent.Do see to his release.But why, sir?! Why would you say that?! Because Constable, had I been born into poverty, I may have done the same.Use the profits from this ring to support your family.Forgo your petty crimes, and become a man of good.Lord Joestar still adopted Dio, knowing of his father's deceit! Father Look at me.The doctors will be here soon Jojo Bear no ill-will towards Dio.His upbringing is my failure.Though I was much stricter with you after his arrival, he may have felt my extra attention towards you was unfair to him.His personality and actions may've been a result of my neglect Son, have him buried next to Dario Brando.Father Jojo, I am at ease Passing in my son's embrace is all and well Lord Joestar! His mercy was his undoing! This mayn't be so! We've lost a true gentleman! Nay, Constable! The soul of Lord Joestar lives on in his son, Jonathan Joestar! The will, body, and soul of a true gentleman shall exist for posterity! I begrudge the pansy penchant for tears, but I willingly shed mine for the Joestars.The pair of naÃ¯ve, but merciful toffs be true gentlemen! T-T- The body! Dio Brando's body is gone! Constable, get away from that window! Wryyy H-He removed the constable's head! H-How is he breathing?! How is he still alive?! Impossible! We littered him with lead, we did! Careful, lads! He may have a w*apon or two! C-Could it have been H-He's approaching us! Then what are you bobbies waiting for?! Blast the bloke to bits! Dio, halt! D-Dio! Jojo, sh**t him! sh**t him, now! H-How is he alive?! He took a b*llet to the brain, too! I'm at an utter loss for words proper of this predicament which we're placed! By George Jojo Behold! This is the magnificence and splendor I've attained from the stone mask and your father's blood! Wryyy You intake blood, the very essence of humans?! What form of malignant maleficence have you become?! M-My brain's abuzz with bits and pieces! The Kn*fe drew my father's blood.Dio, wearing the stone mask, had his brain pierced, and awakened bizarre powers means Dio's no longer human?! Wryyy Father D-Don't fight him! Yer no match for him! Nobody can b*at that monster! He's got more strength than any strongman I've seen! I know.I fear his strength as well! But Dio, no longer shall I allow your terror to spread! I take it upon myself to send you to Hell! Mr.Joestar, no! You'll be torn asunder! The brain! The stone mask's spines unlock the brain's hidden potential! Therefore, the only chance of victory lies with the brain! Blood! The corpse moves! Warm, moist blood Let me lick it up! Lad, let me suck you dry! Though he was not human, death leaves me faint! Father, strengthen my heart to deal merciful blows! Be stouthearted! Deliver Dio a merciful blow for he is no longer human! He descends! Dio, I shall not allow you to slaughter anymore innocents! H-He caught the spear in his own bloody hand! Well I'll be blowed, the hole in his head closed up! He's undying! He can't be k*lled! How shoddy a spear! Jojo! Won't you be good and remain my playmate a while longer? I know not of the other magnificent feats I may perform Hiding, are we? Forgotten my words, already? "The grander a human scheme is, the simpler it is for unforeseen factors to thwart." Be a good chum and come out of hiding from there! I scheme with nothing, but courage! His skin heals even when aflame! The bloke's impervious to any wound! The flames won't k*ll him! A-Are you daft?! Skedaddle, Speedwagon! I don't want to see another innocent harmed! Don't climb upwards! The flames are spreading too fast! What in God's good name are you thinking, Mr.Joestar?! Come join me, Dio! Dio! I cannot allow you to unleash havoc unto the world! Mr.Joestar, you mustn't! You beckon your own death to spare your new chum's life? Very well.I shall mend these scalds with your blood.It's no use, Jojo! As if I would be harmed by such a small drop! You, however, would be dealt a mortal blow from this height! Father Rest in peace.The flames shall carry your ashes to Heaven.And For the sake of avenging your memory, may your spirit fuel these flames evermore! Mr.Joestar, what are you He wouldn't! He shouldn't! Mr.Joestar, don't do it! H-He's here! Wryyyyyyyyy! The shoddy spear again?! At that instant, Jojo's youth flashed before his very eyes! My youth was a youth with Dio! I shall end the feud we started in our youth! Mr.Joestar wants the flames to spread He wants the heat to incinerate Dio! If Dio's healing can't withstand the intensity of the flames, he might bite the dust! That's why Mr.Joestar continued his climb to the roof! Don't do it, Mr.Joestar!!! Y-You buffoon! A Lover's Leap, is it?! The Joestar estate, which housed my forefathers, burns this night My father has passed as well I've nothing left to lose to the world except my life, the last Joestar! Dio, I shall burn to cinder, and in return, your powers shall be rendered useless! Farewell, Jojo! Though brief as it was, your Lover's Leap tactic had me shivering.You may burn alongside your father! Shed your tears while you still can, you buffoon! I have surpassed all human life! As immortal and undying, I am a god amongst all! And I have you to thank, Jojo! I require length! Dio! I've come back for you! Wh-What?! You cur! You won't escape me! Dio, your life shall be extinguished with this Kn*fe! The very Kn*fe you stabbed my father with!!! Wryyyyyyyyyy! I shattered the bones in both his arms, and though we're both set aflame, he continues to cling tight! Very well! Let us fall into the inferno, together! Though Jojo, you'd die a lonesome death, for no matter the intensity of flame, I may retain a feat to escape such predicaments! Father! Grant me the strength to k*ll him! Jojo lets out a cry for help! Did his father's spirit answer his cry? Or, did Jojo instinctively use the wall of the Joestar estate for his next action? He kicks out! And the trajectory of that kick sends them I-Impossible! on top of the Joestar Estate's guardian, the Statue of Love! Damn you, Jojo! Damn you to Hell! I-I had forgotten about the duel we had as children! His true strength! Jojo!!! I was supposed best you in everything Mr.Joestar! Father He's alive! The mad sod's alive! The true gentleman prevails! I've found it.Next Time To know courage is to have known fear! This bloke's more sadistic and bizarre than Dio! Despair for me, you maggots! With whom do I appear similar?

Why does he follow us? Does something trouble you? No It's nothing- Saluti, Signor Jonathan Joestar, and Signora Erina Pendleton.W-Who are you?! You did well to survive your encounter with one afflicted by the stone mask! Jojo! Good, now exhale and purge every ounce of oxygen from your lungs! Jojo! How could you harm an injured man?! Harmed him I have not, though he won't breathe briefly.C-Come again?! Wh-What manner of sorcery is this?! M-My arm! I am Barone Zeppeli.Courage, alone, cannot defeat the power of the stone mask.My fractured arm is completely healed?! I can even heave such heft! How can that be?! Wh-What did you do?! Please good sir, who are you?! Jojo, one question at a time, capisci? I did nothing.Your very breathing healed your fractured arm.Why would you help me?! How do you know my nickname?! H-He's gone?! Jojo, one question at a time.I think it'd be better if I showed you instead.Follow me.Once you see, once you know, then you'll understand why I'm here.I thrust my pinky into your diaphragm in order to control your breathing.Control my breathing? Allow me to demonstrate the effect.Wh-What are you doing? Wh-What are those?! The ripples resonate in unison?! That's absolutely unnatural! This energy is the very energy with which your arm was healed! Not the frog! T-The frog remains unscathed! This is the Art of Mystics.M-Mystics? The Ripple derives from the Art of Mystics.I used the frog's body as a medium to channel Ripple energy, splitting the rock beneath.Jojo! I know the stone mask has yet to be destroyed! Dio Brando possesses the stone mask! What did you say?! Did you say that "Dio" has the stone mask?! Indeed! I've sought the stone mask for decades! I shall see to it that all who wear the stone mask share its fate in death! Your life is bound to the destruction of the stone mask! You must learn the Art of Mystics, or face certain death! You, and all of humanity! I-Impossible Jojo, what does he mean? What is he talking about? Erina I mustn't involve her in this matter.Not again, not ever again.B-Blossoms?! B-Blooming, now?! I-Incredible! Ripple energy remaining from his arm rejuvinated the blossoms of that withered tree! This boy possesses innate strength and profound potential He may be the very savior we need! Noooo!! I can feel my powers returning with every meal.I recall a trophic principle in this regard Farmed swine graze, only to be consumed by humans.However, we farm humans for our own consumption.As top predators, we are gods amongst humanity.Jack, you may dine.We shall accumulate men of true depravity and conquer the world of man.I shall rule almighty over the world, as a God amongst men! One Week Later For the past week, I've been learning to control Ripple energy from this enigmatic Italian, Barone Zeppeli, who agreed to help me defeat Dio.His motivation? Jojo, let me share my motivation for pursuing the stone mask.When I, Will A.Zeppeli, encountered the stone mask, I was young, curious, and voyaging in pursuit of the unknown.I joined my father's archaelogical exploration vessel and sailed around the world in search of artifacts.That all changed when we reached the ancient Aztec ruins.Is that when Yes.And it was me, of all people, who unearthed the damned relic.During our return voyage to Italy, someone, for some reason, wore the stone mask, and coaxed the spines into his skull.A lust for blood consumed him, and he strode through the vessel, leaving naught but the dismembered bodies of the crew in his wake.He slaughtered all 58 of the crew, his own friends.I leapt into the ocean to escape him, and he swam after me as well! Wryyyyy! As dawn broke over the horizon I saw the face of the man responsible for the carnage.It was The captain of the exploration vessel, my own father.The vessel was carried away by the waves, with the stone mask still aboard.I felt guilt.Overwhelming guilt for any incident to follow the one that cost me my father.I felt responsible, and required a means to destroy the stone mask It was soon after that I acquired the Art of Mystics.Ripple energy is born from the bloodstream of humans, as opposed to the stone mask, which sucks up that essence.The undead feed off the blood of the living, for the blood is the Ripple energy! By George! So the only way to upset the balance of blood is Yes! Vampires shall succumb to Ripple energy their bodies cannot sustain! And the Art of Mystics, from which the Ripple derives power, hails from the radiant light of the sun! Barone Zeppeli, please teach me the Art of Mystics! I shall overcome any obstacle you present me! Had you been unwilling, I would have forced you to learn, regardless.Dio desires to be a God amongst men, and you're his greatest obstacle to that end.Listen well.Blood is involved in respiration.In respiration, blood carries oxygen from your lungs, and that oxygen is then diffused into somatic cells.Your somatic cells make up your body.In short, if you can channel a ripple over water, you can also channel a ripple into the human body through respiration, thus, channeling Ripple energy! His fist extended a great length! But how did he do it?! That was my Zoom Punch.I dislocated my shoulder to lengthen my reach.The subsequent pain may be dampened by channeling Ripple energy.But Jojo, you need to control your respiration to control Ripple energy.Keep in mind, Ripple energy is extremely sensitive to emotions.Sir! Hey! Mr.Joestar! Speedwagon! We're going to Wind Knight's Road? Aye, and one of me blokes said he spotted Dio there.He says that most of the villagers have disappeared, too.We have little time to spare with training.Jojo, you'll have to master Ripple respiration in combat.Sir! I am ready and prepared to duel! As am I! There's the tunnel to Wind Knight's Road! Let us resolve all business before the sun sets.I left Erina behind, without saying a word.But I shall return to you, my love! What happened? Coachman! Why cease the coach?! Be careful! We're cut off from sunlight! Coachman Did Dio do this? I didn't see anyone else near us Boys, get away from those horses.Wh-What in Hell's name is he?! He came out of the horse's corpse! Mr.Joestar, that loony's a lunatic! The bugger's battier and more bizarre than Dio! Dio has created more undead allies, has he?! Boys, do step away.I shall fight him.We have a zombie here.Devouring the flesh of the living granted him immortality and strength.But in return, he was made a servant to Dio.He is a puppet to Dio's desires.I shall grant ye gents a grisly grave I desire faces of despair that I may gaze upon as I gouge your guts and bathe in your blood! Sing your ditties of despair for me, maggots! What will he do first? If I were him Listen to what I'm trying to teach you, Jojo.Lesson one.Imagine yourself as the foe in order to anticipate their next move.If I were him, sealing the path to sunlight would be my first prerogative.He cast the coach to crush the ceiling?! Speed, Speedwagon! Watch him! H-He has scalpels protruding from him! S-So that's how he skewered the horses! Ripple Ripper! My Ripple Rippers are sharper than scalpels.Jojo, here's lesson two.Do you know what a "flea" looks like? It's awful microscopic.It does seek to pester humans quite often, si? May we label the nature of such actions as "courageous?" I don't believe they understand the concept.Then what is "courage?" To know courage is to have known fear! One gains courage the moment they overcome fear! Fear destabilizes Ripple respiration! Were a man to conquer his fears, they would have undeterred respiration! Ripple respiration is born from courage! The Hymn of Humanity is the Concerto of Courage! The High of Humanity is the Cheer of Courage! No matter the durability of zombies, they are alike a flea and know naught of courage! Mystic Wave Kick! Ripple energy damages and decomposes the flesh of corpses.It's like magic! He hasn't spilled a drop, neither! Jojo, complete your training.Destroy the creature's brain with Ripple energy.It's the only way to k*ll these vampires.You confounded curs! I shall devour you! I shall dice you into dabs and dots! Are we pursuing the bloke?! Of course.But only Jojo shall pursue him.Jojo.k*ll the creature without spilling a drop of wine.Jojo, here's lesson three.They have a saying up in Norway."It was the great north winds that made the Vikings." I'm warning you, do not spill even a single drop.Spill one drop, and I will leave your company even if you k*ll him! Godfather, are you going gaumless on us?! Silenzio, Speedwagon! Very well! "It was the great north winds that made the Vikings," aye? It's a maze in here The limited light is ineffective for searching him out in this darkness W-Wait, wouldn't this serve as a beacon?! I'll do away with the torch so he won't see the flame.But I'm blind as a bat now! He could be anywhere! I smell it, I do The scent of his warm blood Lesson One: What would I do if I were him? Stalk my target.Lesson Two: Conquer your fears, and courage will stabilize respiration.Closer I'll bite into your neck and pull out your throat with me teeth! The frigid winds of the north bore Vikings with strengthened souls and hardened hearts.It's a trial they must overcome with cunning, otherwise they freeze to death.But will the wine evoke a Viking from Jojo? Jojo can't defeat Dio unless he passes this trial.I-It's a ripple! So this is the great north wind! It detects his Ripple I can feel it from the glass, to my arm, through my body, and onto the floor! I can feel his lifeforce! This wine acts as a Ripple detector! My heart, resolute! My body, ablaze! I have you now, Vampire-zombie! I shall channel a ripple through the wall! Mystic Ripple Overdrive! Hurry up! I'll suck you dry! Jojo used the wine to detect him.My boy, we have ourselves a Viking! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time At last, we meet! I curse thine Tudors to follow! Can we survive this night?! I shall duel thee to the death! Dio, I shall annihilate your ambition! Episode The Knights of Night
01x05 - The Dark KnightsQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:44The township of Wind Knight's Road is isolated by callous cliffs overlooking the ocean.Wind Knight's Road was constructed in the Middle Ages to hone the knacks of knights.In the 19th Century, the existing fortress- esque architecture was used as a prison, where prisoners were sentenced to mine for coal.The villagers, consisting of farmers and fishermen, brought the total population count, including resident inmates, to 517.But now, the village of Wind Knight's Road shall perish!

The Knights of Night Episode The villagers are going about their own business.Thus far, everything seems commonplace.Nevertheless, Dio has to be here! What's the matter? W-Well Signore Speedwagon was begging me to confirm his Ripple aptitude, and so I attempted to strike his diaphragm but I unintentionally struck his stomach instead.Mi dispiace.Sorry, Signore Speedwagon.You're an arse Barone Zeppeli, he's just a child.The boy's a bag-snatcher, si? Clever boy's a real sling n' snatch.Why're you two cheering fer the chap?! The little cur has all of our quid! He's running off! Aye, the boy's a real runner.Well then, I suppose I'll have him work for the money, and act as our guide.H-He can walk on water?! Jojo, if your foot's still in the water, then you haven't stored enough Ripple energy for practical use! That was music to my ears, Jojo.You did channel Ripple energy through the cliff.Should I channel another one from here, or elsewhere? I would move two meters to the left.And I stake two pounds on that.Jumping Jehoshaphat! Catch of the day.Wh-What the Wait.Who are you men? His responses are rather peculiar.Did the Ripple hurt his head? No, it isn't just the boy's responses that are peculiar Look where we stand.Is this a graveyard?! It seems that we became the catch of the day, the moment we set foot here.The boy was bewitched to lure us here.Mr.Joestar, look above! The sun has set this day and your lives shall end this night! Dio! Th-The dead rise! I-I was prepared to see that dastardly devil again! But the sight of that shitter makes me sick! His very stench makes me sweat! How he stands stout and sturdy is nothing short of supernatural! He repaid the affection of Lord Joestar with a Kn*fe to his back! I shall I shall see to his death! So he is Dio.He understands the limitations of immortality under sunlight.For this, he bewitched the boy and had him stall us until sundown.The cunning of this culo makes me cringe.We must see that his death remains permanent! These are zombified knights! Lad, what is your name? P-Poco! Listen, Poco.Be a good lad and grab onto my back! Follow me, Jojo! Aye! Zoom Punch! Awesome! Dio Brando Though I know nothing about you, I know your bizarre powers came from the stone mask, and I say to it At last, we meet again! Hey stronza! Are you going to fight me from that boulder?! Come down and dance with me! I've no need to dance with an insect! I am God over all other life forms.My race shall devour and displace all of mankind! As a God, why would I descend to the footing of men?! He radiates a most sinister aura from his being! He demented demeanor is fashioned as that of a tyrant's! After my abdominal injury is healed, all trace of Jojo's humiliation shall be erased! Ascend to me, sorcerer! I shall use your meager life to mend the last of my scars! You vicious vampire! How many innocents did you k*ll to heal those wounds?! Can you recall every loaf of bread you've had in your life? Dio!!! Barone?! I will k*ll him.I shall channel a Ripple through him! Pulsate unto my palm, Ripple of sunlight! Sunlight Yellow Overdrive! He's done it! The Ripple's been channeled through Dio's arm! My, how brittle you are! H-He's freezing my hand?! Impossible! Barone Zeppeli, si? I understand your "energy" originates from the bloodstream.Then theoretically, your energy flow ceases if pathways are frozen! Did you know that I may manipulate my own body temperature? I merely vaporized the moisture of the energy you channeled.When moisture is vaporized, heat dissipates.Ultimately, physical contact leads to freezing! And now, my idiotic Italian, I shall smash through your brittle arm until I shatter your skull! Dio, I shall annihilate your ambition! I can feel the evil energy surging through your bloodstream! I do enjoy being evil, thank you very much.But if I may, I am in awe that you managed to catch my clutch! You have my compliments.Jojo! But Jojo, I wouldn't hold my hand as dearly as you do now.Die, Dio! Wryyyyyy! Once your hand is frozen, blood won't flow through it! Ergo, your "Ripple energy" cannot be channeled through your hand! H-He's too powerful! He possesses five times the blood of Jojo and me combined! Jojo's hand shall be frozen as mine, unless he unhands Dio! He mustn't be harmed so early into the battle! Barone! H-How can this be?! My hand's as cold as ice! It looks like frostbite, even! Though the texture feels akin to touching a frozen metal, my skin peels with ease! Barone Zeppeli's arm has gone cold! It'll rot without running blood! Dio won't die unless we can channel a Ripple under sunlight! How can we k*ll him?! I tire of all this "ripple" nonsense.If you won't end this battle Th-The bedrock breaks! then I shall have these two ensure a victory worthy of fanfare! Tarkus! Bruford the Black! I've no need to fight these insects.Come forth, and have their fanfare of screams ring true alike trumpets! Wh-Who are these blokes?! Poco, hide! In the 16th Century, they were ex*cuted by Elizabeth I of England.O loyal knights to Mary I of Scotland, Tarkus and Bruford, dispose of them.I leave ye both to stamp out the lives of these insects.Do as ye desire.The big bugger blasted the bedrock to bits with his finger! Those two zombies are eyeing Jojo! Jojo cannot hope to defeat both of them! If only I could force blood to circulate through my arm! What happens if you do that?! I may use Ripple energy to start healing my arm! But I require the frost to be thawed! Barone Zeppeli, you need only your arm to be thawed, aye?! Wh-What are doing?! Will my heart thaw the frost?! Signore Speedwagon! Up in a place called the "Arctic," I heard that people there would cover themselves in a seal's carcass to fight frostbite! Zoom Punch! Thine blood be mine! H-He's sucking my blood with his hair?! Speedwagon, why would you do this for me?! Because Barone Zeppeli, a third wheel can always prove useful to a cart! If your hair can suck blood, then I could very well channel Ripple energy into your skull! Sunlight Yellow Overdrive! I-I can't channel a Ripple! Has my Ripple energy diminished because his hair's still sucking my blood?! Si, I believed you would only impede our mission.I believed you would've rolled out of harm's way! Forgive my doubts, Speedwagon! You can thank me after we've k*lled that shitter! D-Do what you can to accelerate thawing! I must aid Jojo in this battle! Th-The sheer sight of that sword has me sh1tting, it does! The blasted blade is bigger than Mr.Joestar himself! Those black blood-sucking braids and their ghastly gazes leave me lost! Something's driving these two! I've seen me fair share of such men, but never a pair with such purpose! Any educated Englishman would know the terrific tale of Tarkus and Bruford! Even those of legend and lore may become my servants! Around 1565, two queens laid their respective claims to the Throne of England.One was the then-current monarch of England, Queen Elizabeth I, and the other was the beautiful 23-year-old Queen Mary I of Scotland.Tarkus and Bruford the Black were a pair of Mary's most devout knights.Though both men had lost their families to w*r, Mary took them into her warm and merciful embrace.Although both warriors were famed for ferocity, even they yearned for comfort.They fought not for her love, but for a greater cause.Mary could be the monarch England needed.Both men swore devout and undying loyalty to Mary, even if it meant their lives.But in 1567, Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, had passed under unusual circumstances.Elizabeth used the incident to her advantage and accused Mary of murdering Lord Darnley.The entirety of the British Isles called for Mary's head.Mary was subsequently tried, and imprisoned for her perceived crimes.Tarkus and Bruford fought tooth and nail to free Mary from confinement.Elizabeth, agitated by their antics, offered them an ultimatum to a prolonged w*r.Prostrate thineselves unto the custody of Tudors, and I shall spare the life of Mary.We mayn't refuse the offer of Elizabeth.Die I shall without qualm.They surrendered to the Tudors, and were summarily ex*cuted.Have I do displeasing news for thou.Not spared was the life of Mary! The lie of Elizabeth be your death! Behold thine eyes unto yonder.'Twas the head of Mary! Curse you, Elizabeth! Thou art of lies and distrust! Begrudge ye Tudors to damnation! Until the last life of the Tudors begone, we curse thine Tudors to follow! And thus, the end of Tarkus and Bruford.In his rage, Tarkus's muscles contracted greatly, causing the executioner to exhaust many axes before a successful beheading.Bruford, on the other hand, caught the offending executioner's legs by surprise, and was ex*cuted as he dined on the offender's flesh.I do delight deeply for their deranged dander! Remember this night, for the graves of tragic knights were desecrated for the sake of resurrection by the hand of Dio! I've reinvigorated them as vengeful vampires! Wryyyyy! We are devout to Lord Dio! We shall rain doom upon this earth, and slaughter all the innocents of humanity! Th-They've got a gruesome grudge! And that grudge does naught but grow! Dio degenerated the heroes into demons! Can we even hope to defeat such rage?! My left hand burns with a fiery flame! Scarlet Overdrive! I-Incredibile! H-How could I have perished the thought?! Mr.Joestar is not alone in his journey for justice! He carries his father's memory, as well as the hope for a family! He's our savior! The boy bears bits of brilliance He shall serve to limber my limbs of three centuries! The cur is mine to devour! I shall chew on his fine face! Another zombie?! Hold your teeth, squire! H-He's fleet-footed! Milord, the bollocks on this boy be bountiful.May I have the honor of breaking the boy's bounty? Break him.Tarkus, stay your hand! Bruford the Black be bold, bloodthirsty, and brutal! He's a cruel culo, at that! His being oozes an aura of pride and prowess for w*r! A bizarre bind this is Before me is Bruford the Black of the history books, and he's come for my head.I must ready Ripple respiration, and ease my muscles! Wh-What's this?! He has his hands behind his back! Which arm shall he strike with?! Shall he use his legs?! Bruford used his hair! D-Drat! Impeccable instincts.But he declined my Dance of Death! How daring! Mr.Joestar! He can't defeat Bruford if he can't breathe! No respiration, no Ripple! We need to fish him out! I-It's Tarkus! Curses! We must assist Mr.Joestar!

I expect the zombies of Wind Knight's Road to spread throughout the British Isles! I-I need air in order to channel a Ripple! One bubble of air shall suffice! Now, swim to the surface! Inhale the air you require, for I am weighed down by this armor! The sword shall stay sheathed, and I shall duel thee to the death! Now, act before you drown to death! Can I make it to the surface before he does?! I'm uncertain! As he choked on incoming water, the profound potential within Jojo's being conceived a most bold thought! Ordinary folk would only considered escaping by swimming towards the surface, but not Jojo did the contrary! Incredibly, against all odds, Jojo swam deeper into the depths! Wh-Why would he dive deeper?! Danny got ahold of your toy p*stol and won't release it? He won't let go because you're pulling it away.Here's a thought.Stop trying to pull it, and just give in.Wind Knight's Road inmates mined for coal! Therefore, this area was subjected to subsidence!

He got him! No, he still lives! Bruford breached to the top with the same haste as my Aqua ripple during the very moment it struck him! My Ripple only rasped him due to the sprint of his swim! I must strike the knight with my knuckles and channel the Sunlight Yellow Overdrive! Milord bestowed a breath unto Bruford the Black, and thus, may battle this boy's bounty with bliss! The bravery of this boy be akin to Bruford's own! Ne'ertheless, such bravery shall be broken on this bedrock! The b*ttlefield be balanced, and only our bravery shall battle!

Your blood shall become the blood of the Black! Another Dance of Death, is it?! I accept! Let us dance the Ripple reel! Sora kobore ochita futatsu no hoshi ga Once, two sh**ting stars descended from Heaven and flew straight into an ocean of emotion.Hikari to yami noãminamo suikomareteyuku From their impact, a ripple of strife exploded! hikiauyouni takanaru hamon hokori no michi wo yukumono ni taiyou no michibiki wo One lead the path of pride under guidance from the Sun, yabou no hate wo mezasu mono ni while the other strove for unbound ambition ikenie wo no matter the cost.furueru hodo kokoro moetsukiru hodo atsuku The star of the Sun, unwavering, burning with vigor, radiates a courageous flame sono te kara hanate kodou karada minagiru yuuki de engulfing its entire being! mayoi naki kakugo ni gassai wo Both stars ready to collide sono chi no sadame jojo For it's in the blood of all JoJos! Episode Courage of Tomorrow Overdrive of Ruin! Jojo! C-Curses! Jojo cannot channel a Ripple without use of his arms or legs! If his arms and legs remain bound by Bruford, Jojo cannot channel a Ripple to break those braids! A-As much as I'd love to help him, Tarkus blocks our way! H-His hair cuts through my clothes and into my skin! The more I struggle to break these braids, the more blood it sucks! Now boy, I shall deliver unto thee death! I shall behead thee and bathe in thine blood! Very well! I shall channel my Metal Ripple, Solid Silver Overdrive! W-Well played! Mr.Joestar parried the blade, and followed through by channeling a Ripple through his arm! My heart, resolute! My body, ablaze! My radiant Ripple releases! Sunlight Yellow Overdrive! There's the sound! The sound of an inferno that follows a channeled Ripple! B-Bruford was a cut above any zombie I've ever faced! I knew of his heroism in history, but he had to die once more Bruford had become a vengeful vampire who threatened humanity.It had to be done! I am Bruford the Black! I mayn't be maimed by such strikes! Yer a bitter bugger, Bruford! Yer a zombie, up a creek without a bloody arm, and you still want to jostle with Mr.Joestar?! What the-?! Are you mad, Mr.Joestar?! He'll behead you if you don't do something! Move your arse! He stopped?! What's the meaning of this?! Sir Bruford "mayn't be maimed by such strikes," aye? Then you felt pain to liken my strikes to "maiming." Fl-Flowers They bloom where Bruford stands! The Ripple has begun rending Bruford's body asunder, and has regained the sensation of pain.A sensation zombies would never feel.While the Ripple corrodes the remains of Bruford's body, it restored Bruford's humanity and his chivalry as a knight.For this, I held my hand against my fellow man.That is why you ceased your slash.Look at his face! No longer is the bugger's face contorted in rage! He's got the face of a wee babe, leering at his mum! Thou seated diligent to awaiteth mine blade Mine blade, thou knoweth mayn't cometh unto thine neck? Retain thou, faith in mine humanity? "Pain" be a sensation of mine humanity.Were mine humanity retain "pain," then retain "joy" as well.Lost, was mine humanity.Though now, I feel naught but comfort.Foregone, has mine rage toward humanity.'Twas mine fortune to jostle with so marvelous a man of faith.Mine dear queen awaiteth Mine friend of faith in three centuries, name thineself.I am Jonathan Joestar.Jonathan Granteth thee, the words mine dear queen etched upon mine blade.Luck.(Fortune) Thou shalt taketh this word for thine crusade.Pluck.(Courage) Sir Bruford! This feels alike a Shakespearean tragedy.To restore his humanity, I had to deal a merciful blow! Though he d*ed bearing a considerable grudge against humanity, how could a man so heroic and chivalrous become so wrought with vengeance?! The fault lies with the stone mask! And the deranged disciple of the stone mask, Dio! Jojo! Behind you! Tarkus?! H-How could you?! Why desecrate the memory, the armor of your fallen knight so?! Bruford be naught but a blackguard! He retained my respect as a fellow knight, but Bruford was naught but a dancer! However, I pride mineself as an Elite Executioner! With naught but brawn and brute, I may lay waste to any and all! Sing for me a symphony of screams! Nice catch, Jojo! This cliff collapses! Leaves! Jojo! Sir! Overdrive of Salvation! Grab ahold, Speedwagon! Poco! Humans possess minute capabilities in biomagnetism, meaning that humans are capable of producing magnetic fields.With the Ripple, biomagnetism in humans may be greatly manipulated, and channeled through many leaves to create one giant manifestation! We're flying! Up yers! How did you two do this?! Are you even human? Or, are you seraphs of some sort? I want to know too, Boyo! After everything we've been through today, I still know nothing about Barone Zeppeli! Where the bloody Hell did you learn all this magic?! When I was in British India, I met a most peculiar physician in a port city.I found him too youthful to be a physician, and yet, he insisted that he was one.And indeed, he was.His patient's leg had undergone severe necrosis, which would warrant amputation in the West, but this man's glowing fingers healed his patient's leg.That power stemmed from the Art of Mystics! I felt that the Art of Mystics was the only means to defeat the stone mask, and so I paddled up the Gyalmo River which ran through Tibet in search of his master, his Lama.The Lama's name was Tong Pheti.Wayfarer from the West, your future is now known to my eyes.You wish to learn the Art of Mystics, aye? Know now, that if you pursue the Art of Mystics, you shall be doomed to destruction! Then so be it.I must have these arts to combat the evil to come.I mustn't share the omen of Lama Tong Pheti, not with Jojo, not with anyone! B-Barone? D-Does the Ripple make this sound to keep us gliding? N-No, it isn't! It's Tarkus! H-He's leapt after us! How could he risk leaping into a chasm to k*ll us?! He mayn't break through fortified Ripple energy! Play with the sun, and you shall be singed! What's that?! I-It's the Fortress of Knighthood! Ready yourselves for a leap! Otherwise, it'll be a crash landing! Tarkus crashed straight through the masonry! Though immortal, his body must've been bashed to bits! Dio gained regenerative properties only through the mask, whereas his zombie servants did not, and are debilitated! Ma-Mamma mia! He lives only for the thrill of battle! His should've been crippled from that crash! He's climbing up here! Though our main prerogative is the death of Dio, I tire of this game we play! We must terminate Tarkus tonight! Jojo! Take the bambino inside and hide him! This is quite a daunting door I heard something else, too.Wa-Watch your step.Knights used to duel to the death in these ruins.I heard it's full of booby traps.Mr.Joestar, I heard chains! Mister! Jojo! Wh-What is this?! Tarkus?! How long it has been? The Chamber of Ouroboros's tug of w*r.I shall partake of my pastime for once in three centuries.This was one of the Fortress of Knighthood's trials, the Chamber of Ouroboros's chain-collar tug of w*r.I fell 48 knights in this contest.Indeed, mine most capable of contests be this tug of w*r.B-Barone Zeppeli, break your barrage! It can't be broken! H-His fist is bloodied and busted! Th-The Art of Mystics had no doctrines on destroying dense material! I may break bricks with the Ripple, but not so dense a door! Ergo, Jojo faces a similar predicament as I! He cannot cleave the chain with the Ripple! Thine collar be locked with a key, rests within mine collar! The door to your fellows shan't open whilst we duel, and the key to my collar rests within yours.One of us need only sever the head of the other to be free! Metal Overdrive! T-The chains are enclosed within the ceiling, and will disperse Ripple energy to the ceiling, not the chain! He's fractured my arm, and I cannot treat it without Ripple respiration because my neck is being crushed as he pulls this chain! I cannot breathe! Jojo! Blast it! I-I've piddled my pantaloons! I-I've had enough! I can't stay with them They're the ones who brought this trouble to our town! Barone Zeppeli, behold the bar! This door can only be opened from within! I'm certain Jojo can hold his own, but he's been battered from his battle with Bruford.We must find a way inside! Together, we may defeat Tarkus! But Barone, I see no other way to enter! It's a tight squeeze.They wouldn't be able to go through there.But maybe I could fit Damn this door! Signore, this door shan't be budged! We must scale down, towards the m*nled masonry! B-But that would take too long! We've dabbled with the damn door long enough! Am I nothing more than a third wheel?! I serve no purpose! I am a tired third wheel! Gander at me, Poco.Gander at my face, you squab! Poco's a pansy-boy! Let's light the pansy a wee f*g.Now, be good and breathe it all in! He's gonna spit up, he will! O-Over there! B-Boys, let's blow! P-Peggy Fancied yourself a good bludgeoning, did we? My bairn of a brother, I think you should try throwing a punch or two.I-I'll punch them back tomorrow! And which "tomorrow" will this be? T-Tomorrow.Poco.What are you scared of most? Might it be the hurt of my hand? You don't like the hurt, do you? The hurt's much better for you than growing into a limping lady of a man! Do you want to be a lady?! I-I don't Come closer, my wee bairn.I'll wash the dirt out of those clothes.Poco?! A window?! G-Get down from there! Don't do it, Poco! Stop him! If that little bambino breaks into that room, Tarkus will blast him to oblivion! Child, descend to me! Climb out! R-Remember the words of that blond beast If Mr.Jojo dies, he'll att*ck our township! He'll hurt Peggy! Don't worry, Peggy! Poco will protect you! Peggy! "Tomorrow" is today! Poco, run away! Ye dare deter our duel?! Poco!!! I'm not scared of the pain anymore Open sesame.Yer a pretty perky kid, Poco The tyke's gonna live, Mr.Joestar! Barone Zeppeli, burn that bastard 'til he bleeds! Barone?! You shall be doomed to destruction! At last At last, the Lama's omen has come to pass! If I am to be destroyed, then so be it.Barone Zeppeli! What do you mean, "destroyed?!" I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time This can't be happening!

Why would you want to know? I became a disciple of the Art of Mystics for the sole sake of combatting the coming evil.Should I learn the details of my death, and I shall be steeled for a short life.Only then, shall I acquiesce and acquire the final Ripple.And only then, may I be rend without regret.If so steeled, you are, for the suffering to come, then so be it! A child shall unseal an accursed chamber containing a wrathful revenant of yore.The injured lion, which is chained in this chamber, shall give way to powerful prides.Though you grant him the strength to be freed, you shall perish in a most pressing predicament.Barone Zeppeli Beware of the big bastard! Jojo, allow me to assist! The injured lion, who is chained in this chamber, shall give way to powerful prides.Sora kobore ochita futatsu no hoshi ga Once, two sh**ting stars descended from Heaven Hikari to yami noãminamo suikomareteyuku and flew straight into an ocean of emotion.From their impact, a ripple of strife exploded! hikiauyouni takanaru hamon One lead the path of pride under guidance from the Sun, hokori no michi wo yukumono ni taiyou no michibiki wo while the other strove for unbound ambition yabou no hate wo mezasu mono ni no matter the cost.ikenie wo furueru hodo kokoro moetsukiru hodo atsuku The star of the Sun, unwavering, burning with vigor, sono te kara hanate kodou radiates a courageous flame engulfing its entire being! karada minagiru yuuki de mayoi naki kakugo ni gassai wo Both stars ready to collide sono chi no sadame jojo For it's in the blood of all JoJos!

How, Barone How could we even hope to continue this crusade without you?! Jojo! Do-Don't be a dense disciple! We have no time for tears! Yo-You don't need Leave me here, and go defeat Dio Destroy the stone mask Barone! Brief as my life was, I regret nothing.I was once married, and even had a family.But I left them, in pursuit of the stone mask.I knew I had done wrong, and yet I regret nothing.I embraced my fate of a short life Now, I've shared with you both my story.But Jojo.You are my only hope for humanity! Barone To me, you are a dear friend and beloved son.I'll always be with you.Now, and forever.Cia-! In the 19th Century, there was an English novelist known as William M.Thackeray who once said, "To love and win is the best thing, to love and lose is the next best." Jojo had lost his master, but he gained Zeppeli's story and spirit.Rest in peace, Barone Zeppeli.I-I beg of you! Please, spare my child's life! So if I may, Madam, allow me to clarify your request.You would willingly join my horde, on the condition that I spare the child.Is that correct? Please, just spare my baby boy! No more tears, please.How touching.Very well.Neither I nor my horde shall harm your child.I'll cross my heart, even.I must note though, Madam, my loyal servants surrendered their mortality to me in exchange for immortality, but would you not want your child to have to same? You both would be together, forever, without any mortal quarrel for all eternity.Please, just spare my baby boy! Spare him! Have it your way.My beautiful baby boy! I kept my word, Madam, but perhaps you should've chosen yours better.Now, your beautiful baby became your banquet.Mr.Joestar's wearing a solemn scowl now.His emotions are eclipsed in that shadow.We're all in the same boat.We're all trying to keep our emotions bottled up.But only after we've defeated Dio can we cry and curse! Mr.Joestar.Dio said that he'd transform all of Wind Knight's Road within the span of a night.If his zombies start infecting others, we'll have a plague to oppose.Is the township safe? Is anyone even alive in Wind Knight's Road? I hope Peggy and the others are okay We make haste! Mr.Adams! Poco, just what in God's name are you doing out so late?! Mr.Adams, have you seen Peggy? A-Are the town and its people okay?! "Okay?" It's pretty far from "okay!" It's bollocks! I got locked in yer barn after breaking my back all day!

Desist, Jonathan Joestar.I am a mortal human.Pardon my surprise, but I wanted to test the techniques of Barone Zeppeli's disciple.You know Barone Zeppeli?! Aye.Our friendship spans 20 years now, from the time we were disciplined in the Art of Mystics by our master and Lama, Tong Pheti.Indeed.I am Straits.Read this.A letter? Who sent it? Barone Zeppeli?! Indeed.Zeppeli sent that, requesting our assistance.After he discovered the location of the stone mask and its proprietor, Zeppeli wrote to us, detailing your current predicament.Meet our Lama, Tong Pheti.Greeeetings.So you are Barone Zeppeli's master, Lama Tong Pheti? For disciples of Mystics, greetings require no contact.This is our greeting.If I may, might I inquire Zeppeli's whereabouts? So, Zeppeli has already embraced his fate.Were we to have arrived sooner, his fate would've still been the same.Tell me, is this "Dio" so overwhelming a foe to face?

Episode Jojo & Dio's Battle of Blood Take for instance the ripeness of this very rose.If I had to guess, you'd be as rosy as the rose I hold.Let us now move onto maturation, Mademoiselle.When this bloom blossoms, only withering would await.Wouldn't that just be a terrible waste? She is a sweet lass of 16! A vestal virgin, in fact! Lord Dio, would you not die to dine on a lass as sweet and succulent as she? An undisciplined dog deserves naught but death.Well, Madomoiselle? Won't you make a choice? Wouldn't you want to stay 16 for all eternity? You won't be beguiled into keeping my company, either.I just want you to determine your own destiny.Demon Louder, Madamoiselle.Y-You are demon, condemned to damnation for all eternity! Well then, while I find it regrettably regrettable to leave your company so soon, a parting gift.This is Doobie the Demon.If you'd rather deal with a real demon, then deal with Doobie.Au revoir, Mademoiselle.Wh-Who threw that?! Who knows.I could tell you, but my name needn't grace the ears of evil! Peggy! Poco! We got his face, we did! What manner of sorcery subsides in that sack? Wh-What's in there Th-That zombie snuck snakes into his skull! He's got toxic cobras and other vicious serpents! Lost for words? Mr.Jojo's been bitten by the toxic snakes! S-Several of them, too! Gee whillikers I have no time to deal with Dio's demons! Well done.He purged the poison.He's done well to control his Ripple respiration within a single week.It's the late barone's lifeforce that lifted Mr.Joestar's powers! Watch, as I spin the blood of your snakes with a small Ripple! Peggy! Poco?! Peggy! I've returned from the fortress for you, Dio.So you survived, Jojo.It seems your survival stemmed from defeating both Bruford and Tarkus.Lord Dio! Allow us the honor of beheading this human! Let my fangs fill this fool with holes! Dio! No.This foe This foe is mine to fall! I shall speak straight, Jojo.I never wanted to subject you to servitude.I never wanted my best chum, my brother, to be zombified, for there is no gratification to be had from it.Ergo, I left your supposed demise to Bruford and Tarkus.But that obviously ended in error.As a God, I cannot afford the liability of seeing you alive any longer! So now, I shall swing the scythe of slaughter! As shall I! I shall bring the axe upon your head, Dio! We'll get to it, Jojo But whatever happened to that idiotic Italian of yours? Where is he? Dio, I shall be direct with you.It's unbecoming of a gentlemen to swear vengeance, but to be ever so straight, I, Jonathan Joestar, would want nothing more than to eliminate your evil existence! Then do it, Jojo! Then do it, Jojo! Mr.Dire? Stand aside, Jojo.The one with seniority shall be the first to avenge his friend.Zeppeli and I were fellow disciples and friends for 20 years! For vengeance, vampire! I shall cast you into the very depths of Hell! Desist! You know too little of his skills and strength! Fascinating footwork.Perhaps the limits of human potential may be expanded to attain drift through discipline.However, your discipline pales in comparison to the deification I've earned this day! Wryyyyyyy!!! Dare you defeat me with such lackluster legerity?! I have you now, fool! Lightning Pincer Lunge! Incredible! Mr.Dire can deflect any att*ck and drive through with the that lunge! It's a crafty charge! None have broken through Dire's drive! Ice! It's absolutely useless! I-I'm frozen stiff! The Freezing Finger! The vampire vaporizes moisture on contact, causing the body to freeze from heat loss! Once frozen, your blood stops flowing and you can't channel any Ripple! A-And the bastard has become better at this.He froze Dire's whole body on contact! Y-You cur! Brittle in the britches, are we?! Buffoon, were you beguiled into the belief of my defeat?! You've ventured here for a brutal death, aye?! Then you shall have a most brutal death! D-Dire! Don't do it! Jojo, you're next in line for the trip to Hell! Dire! Did you enjoy the prick of a Ripple Rose? Dire!!! Mr.Dire! H-How dare you How dare you foil my fair face! Mr.Dire Speedwagon! Here! Dio! Mr.Dire has shown me the sole solution to slashing your Frozen Fingers off! And I shall demonstrate my design of your defeat! I shall behead you with the Rippled blade of Bruford, Luck & Pluck! Fortune Courage Fortune Fortune Courage Fortune Courage Fortune Courage Fortune Courage Courage Fortune The flower is fouler than the feces of frogs That accursed Ripple Rose harmed my fair face! Big are your bollocks, aye?! Then may they be burst by my bands of undead beasts! Make those blue faces bloody, my beasts! And the stinky shitter of a devil makes a stunning return! His gentlemanly facade and has all but faded away! Nothing can cloak the stench of a shitter! His first taste of a true Ripple's been a bitter one to swallow! I, Straits, shall spare you no mercy! I am Page! Jones! Plant! Bonham! Fool in the Rain! The sap of a rose is its lifeblood, and the Ripple may only be channeled through the lifeblood of the living.However, when the Ripple is channeled through metal, it conducts and disperses the energy.The horde of the hungry huddle to us.We shall suppress their stomachs.From what I know already, the shitter has the dashing legs of a leopard! But with the powers of Barone Zeppeli, Mr.Joestar may dash Dio's speed! And yet, the shitter's strongman strength may rend through both bone and flesh with ease! Who will win? The first clash should show the victor! I shall strangle you into an eternal silence! I permanently purify your putrid passions! When did he hide these roses?! Die, Dio! Well done! He's dashing at Dio from the right, where his eye's been blinded! C-Curses! Jojo's grown judicious from his jams! H-He dashed Dio! At last, Dio is defeated! Bollocks! You bloody buffoons! T-The sword is frozen! And how brittle it is! Wryyyyy! Now, I may enslave you as my loyal servant! I can feel your carotid artery pulsing between my fingers, Jojo! The warmth of this artery feels rather pleasant, it does.T-Take this! He's frozen my foot in frost! An utterly useless attempt! Enough of this foolishness, Jojo! You try anything again, and I'll sever your delicate carotid artery! If I so much as nick it, my vampiric essence shall enter your bloodstream and transform you! I-I have to help him! My minions! Stall those damned dancers for a duration! The hungry continue to huddle to us! We cannot help him as we are! Well Jojo, I'll have to hurt your artery in order to make you my loyal servant! You haven't defeated me yet, Dio, because you've made another error! Unlikely! Oh, but you failed to freeze my whole body for the sake of sucking my blood! If you had frozen my whole body, I would've be powerless to fight, but you wouldn't have been able to suck my blood, either! Your failure to prioritize your objectives was your error! He's scorching the sword! Curses! The flames thaw frost faster than heat dissipation through vaporization! He'll channel a Ripple through the sword! Sunlight Yellow Overdrive! Take this! He defeated Dio! Swerve, Speedwagon.As Dio still stands, the Ripple failed to be channeled.My arm My arm is frozen again! How could it freeze by contacting his face?! You were far too eager to exert some steam, Jojo! I shall commend you for your craft and cunning.I shall also commend you for using the flame to thaw the frost.But Jojo, my Frozen Fingers shall never be defeated.Contacting my body will freeze your arm, while another two seconds would freeze your whole body.He's purged himself of the vampiric essence! Mr.Joestar hasn't given up hope! Why do you take so tense a stance? Why do you even bother? I told you that the apex of human potential is limited, did I not? No matter what skills you've gained through the Ripple, it's absolutely, positively, ultimately, undeniably useless against me! A human could never ascend a God! And in terms of animals, Jojo, you are nothing more than a monkey to me! You're wrong! So long as I am devoted, the apex of human potential is unlimited! I demonstrate the result of said devotion! You won't have the time! I shall enslave you within moments! His hand! His hand burns! His fist is aflame! He could thaw the Frozen Fingers with fire! Who shall prevail in this predicament?! Duel me, Dio! Wryyyyyyyyyyyy! H-His hand's been caught! No! His fists followed through! M-M-My beautiful body melts! T-This flaming pain is unlike any other! I was supposed to live for centuries to come! I Dio finally bites the dust! and I alone He condensed his blood into a beam of light?! It would've taken my head off if it strayed a few centimetres to the right! Th-That was close! As he passes in pain, he commits one final act of evil before succumbing to silence.Dio's dropping down into the depths below! Dio Mr.Jojo! He's exhausted.The day of death, night of knights, and morn of mourning have taken its toll.Why does he weep for the death of that demon? Because he shared his youth, together with Dio.But I'm glad he's gone! Behold, Barone Zeppeli! We b*at him! Mr.Joestar b*at him bloody! At last, Dio is defeated! I might be mad to say this, but I daresay that we've saved the world! I'll be the roundabout The words will make you out 'n' out We spend the day your way Call it morning driving thru the sound and In and out the valley Eh!

Atlantic Ocean - American Passage The poor bird's one wing won't work It's fallen from the flock Erina, what's wrong? Why are you weeping? I'm shedding tears of joy, because we're together now.I've got the gentleman who further wrought the wrath of bullies by displaying a handkerchief with his proud name, Jonathan Joestar.I couldn't ask for anything more.Neither could I.I've married the miss who bandaged and embraced me with her warmth, while I was enveloped in a frigid darkness, Erina.I'm pleased to have protected the world that you know and love.If only Father could have met you Erina, let's go to dinner.Jonathan-! I-I was trying to warn you I wish our happiness would be eternal Christ, it fell in the engine room! Of all the filthy fields it could've fallen into I could curse the clergy for all I care, but the rosary is my only resource.O God in Heaven Why do you keep sending me to these Godforsaken places? I couldn't.I've never indulged before.Indulge a little.A sip shall suffice.It's rather light, so sip some.Sip.A-Aren't you Jonathan? Could it be It couldn't! Dio still lives? Erina, return to our cabin! And lock the door behind you! This is a peculiar coffin The pad is unlocked.It's a bit bizarre, in fact.I can see the coffin's clasp shimmer from within But wouldn't that mean that this coffin could only be opened from inside?! Halt! Aren't you There's my beautiful body.D-Dio! Jonathan seemed quite jarred Something's off! Look at what I've become, Jojo.I wanted you to see what became of a God.And why do I degrade my dignity by displaying my head? Even though you've thwarted my plans, time and time again, you've earned my respect.I commend your courage, envy your vigor, and respect your resilience.And it's dawned upon me Dio Jojo Were it not for you, I would've never been bestowed the blessings of the stone mask.But were it also not for you, I would've ruled the world by now.If there is a God, and if He does facilitate fates, then I can only conclude that He purposely twisted ours to each other.I've realized that without you, I am incomplete.Therein, your body is the only one that would make me whole again, and with it, my eternal existence shall be an ecstatic one! That is the destiny of Dio Brando! I shall be swift with the stroke, as my respect for my revered rival requires it! H-His eyes! T-They glow! Your body shall be mine to have, Jojo! Jonathan! J-Jonathan! Erina! Now why would you do that? If you hadn't moved, I could've blasted through your brain.You wouldn't have to suffer as much as you do now.We've gone from dining in a hall to dining in Hell.The sight of the unsightly has left the lady speechless, has it? Jojo never did tell you the tales of my deeds, did he? I may be but a head, but surely, you recall your first kiss Erina Pendleton? My mistake.Mrs.Erina Joestar, is it not? Dio?! The boat's been beset by beasts! As per your instruction, I infected one passenger, who went on to infect others for the horde! And you shall have an even greater horde once we've reached America.I can't speak I can't even breathe I must breathe Erina Erina! I shall save you! I can't channel a Ripple! Behold, Lord Dio! The accursed cur can't even breathe! If he can't breathe, the Ripple is useless to him! Shall I smother out what life he has remaining now, in return for humiliating you, Lord Dio? Or perhaps we should watch him writhe in agony? Asphyxiation should only last a few more minutes.Watch your tongue, Wang Chung.Do not disrespect Jojo.He was the only human who forced me to survive as a head.Out of respect, I don't to prolong his suffering any longer, so go, and sever the sod's head! As you wish, Lord Dio.His beautiful body shall become my beautiful break! Jonathan! Be wary of his movements! Withdraw, Wang! He's bound to try something before succumbing! What's there to be wary about?! Lord Dio respect for this cur has left him too cautious! I shall scoop out your skull with my claws you stupid simpleton! I shall save Erina I have one breath to give One faint, yet final Ripple to channel I shall unleash every ounce of my Ripple energy! It shall suffice! W-Withdraw now, Wang Chung! I-I've lost something As if that something has all but vanished But what could it be? Curses! I-It was my lifeforce I channeled it all into my final Ripple I-It was too weak to destroy that zombie, but I've made use of him.I-Impossible! Jojo must've done something to Wang Chung's body! The Ripple didn't destroy his body, but controlled his body's tissue instead! Wang Chung's body is ordered to halt that shaft.A-And that shaft he's stopping is the ship's paddle-wheel propeller shaft! A zombie's strength is sufficient enough to stop the shaft, and if the shaft is stopped, the steam in the pistons remain trapped, causing pressure to increase from within! If that pressure causes the piston walls to rupture, the ship will explode! Jonathan! How could this be? How could this happen to you? How? E-Escape, Erina T-This ship's set to explode I have no idea how things came to be this way and equally, I don't know whether I should cry, scream, or faint.I'm at an utter loss.But I can do one thing.I, Erina Joestar, will accompany you in death.I can feel the warmth fade from his lips Why, oh why? I can feel his life slipping away.My beloved Jonathan Joestar will die But if we can be together in death, let this embrace last.When the ship explodes, everything will be set ablaze and our ashes will be scattered into the sea.Weep as you will, but I need you to live on, my love You're so selfish! How could you ask me to save the babe and myself?! I can't be the one to do it! My only desire is to die together with you! As that babe's mother d*ed in its stead my mother did the same for me! Take the babe and escape! You never cease to amaze me with your cunning, Jojo! Even in death, you manage to lead my ambitions askew! But I've learned from your cunning and resilience! I shall survive! My existence shall be eternal, and your body shall ensure that eternity! My minions! Chow down on Wang Chung! Remove his arms and make that shaft spin! It's too late for that Jonathan! The pistons have begun exploding! But I won't be blown away by this boat or the blasted sun! I've made prior preparations in the case of an expl*si*n! Erina, get a good look at your gent! Jojo's utterly defenseless against my domination, and I shall have his body within moments! Once I've finished, I shall make my escape in that coffin! It may withstand the expl*sive force of several bombs! I call my personal b*mb shelter! Now die, Jojo! At last, I shall have my beautiful body for centuries to come! Jonathan! Dio Maybe we really are incomplete without each other.We are bizarre brothers, you and I.And now, our fate shall be shared together in death, with the expl*si*n to scatter our ashes.Farewell, my love Erina Unhand me, Jojo! Let me go and we'll think this through, together! I shall allow your existence to be eternal as well! I shall seal your stings, and you can live with Erina for all eternity, Jojo! Jojo?! H-He's dead.February 07, 1888 Jonathan Joestar passes away Jonathan Joestar lost his life on that voyage, and nobody would ever know of the events that transpired aboard that ship.None would ever learn of his brave exploits or his life as a gentleman, save for his descendants.However, I was certain that the child within my womb, his child, would learn of them from me.On February 09, Erina Joestar was rescued near the Canary Islands.At long last, a chapter in the Stone Mask Epic came to a conclusion.But soon, another chapter, another adventure, would be etched into the Stone Mask Epic.JOJO's Phantom Blood End Bizarre Adventure I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time The year was 1938 Long has it been, Mr.Speedwagon.How did you know about my knuckle Kn*fe?!

01x10 - New York's JoJoQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:47We all know this old man! We've seen that look, we've seen that scar! Long has it been, Mr. Speedwagon.I've heard of your great success in America's oil business.I'd call it meager, if anything at all.But how I envy your youthful face, Master Straits.You couldn't possibly be 75, as I.I suppose it's due to your Ripple Respiration.If only I could have had the aptitude as well.It has been 49 years since Jonathan's passing, and the times and generation have all moved on.Straits became the Lama of the Art of Mystics, and Robert Edward O.Speedwagon became an oil baron.They would now fly to Mexico to investigate certain ruins.Certain ruins that were discovered by the Speedwagon Foundation's archaeological team, containing certain artifacts that only Straits and Speedwagon were familiar with.What you are about to see will most likely stun, no, will without a doubt, shock your spine its every segment into terror! You will feel greater disgust than you did 50 years ago! Greater than the disgust Dio drowned us all in! This is quite the grand hall! Master Straits, I asked you here because of this! T-This is the stone mask! There are several stone masks as well! 1938 New York It was the autumn of 1938.I was marking folks, my routine ring-a-rounds around town.Come again, son? You've never heard of Coco-Cola?! Son, I'm hearing a bit of ol' Blighty in yer voice.Are you a tourist? Oh, so you immigrated over recently? Anywho, yer gonna hav'ta pay first.Money's the law of the land 'round here.Hey! My British buddy, he snatched yer wallet! Get after him! What a chump! My best snatch today! What's up, Smokey? Yer my best snatch today! Caught in the act, in fact! Don't run, you filthy five-fingering hood! I'll make sure yer black butt's going in the big house for the next twenty years! Please Officer Ferman! All I did was snatch a wallet! Stop singing, you moon cricket! I hate you and all yer kind! But I'm a generous guy, see.From now on, yer gonna be bringing me $20 every week.That, and half of yer "earnings," too! Pardon me.Well if it ain't the chump who got his wallet snatched.I'm gonna keep this as evidence, so scram.Well sir, here's the thing I gave him that wallet, Officer.Unbelievably, that 6-foot-4-or-so British boy came to save my butt from being busted.So, would you be so kind as to unhand both him and his wallet? Come again?! I gave him that wallet because he's my mate, he is.Would you unhand him? Yer friend, eh? Why don'tcha tell me his name then? You don't know his name, do you? Do you wanna end up in the big house for obstruction of justice? Well do you, my bumbling Brit? If you wouldn't mind me asking, why would you, an officer of the law, smear your boogie on me? The aim of such an action befuddles the brain.There don't have to be any "aim!" I can do whatever I want and yer cheer is making me mad, you mook! If you want me to smear your left cheek, then face the other-! The only thing I'm hearing from you is bollocks, Bobby! You limey loon! You're under arrest! Go on and sh**t! You won't get a sh*t off though! When you pull that trigger back, I'll snap your trigger finger in half! Like a matchstick! Not from where I'm standing! I'll blow a b*llet through yer brain! It was then, that I saw his body glow with a little bit of light.Whatever magic he used, it caused the bottle cap to explode from the bottle, breaking the copper's trigger finger! I lost my temper again! O-Oh no Na-Nanna Erina will throw a fit.T-This cr*cker's crazy! After everything he's done to these two coppers, how could he even be afraid of a scolding from "Nanna Erina?!" Hey, Pickpocket! Let's skedaddle on outta here! I asked how he made that bottle cap explode off its top, but even he didn't know "how." He says he could always do these "tricks," ever since he was a kid.According to him, his grandfather, who d*ed young, could do the exact same thing, but his father, who d*ed a fighter pilot during the Great w*r, couldn't.His mother wasn't around for him, either.I owe you one for helping me out.My name's Smokey.What's yours? Joestar.Joseph Joestar.Battle Tendency JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE Episode Joseph the Yank But call me Jojo.Who Who is the man embedded in this pillar?! It's no carving, that much I can tell! He has amino acids, living cells, body temperature, and a pulse! He is very alive! Master Straits, I don't care about what he is, how long he's lived, what his relation to these stone masks is, or what his purpose on God's green Earth is! I asked you here for one single reason.While he sleeps, I want you to k*ll him and all these stone masks with the Ripple! That is all I ask! How is Joseph Joestar? How does he fare? I seem to recall hearing that he used the Ripple to rescue you.Why do you ask? I believe it happened when he was 13.Yes, it was when your plane was h*jacked, and you were held hostage for ransom.Boyo! We need yer rump up front.Get up and go.You h*jacked Great-Uncle Speedwagon's plane to hold him hostage, right? We might be on this flight together, but I'm not worth a thing to you.Leave me to my comic papers and go about your business.I'll have no back-talk from ye, boyo! Jojo! C-Crikey! Being struck by these stooges doesn't bother him, but Jojo's easily infuriated over soiling the clothes Erina bought for him! Jojo, don't be hasty now! Hijacking and holding our flight for ransom would imply that you three were also prepared to have a crash landing as well, right?! Was that the Ripple?! The boyo's bonkers! He's trying to k*ll us all! We can't fly! Grab the controls! Hey, we're jumping so grab a seat! You are the most reckless, thoughtless boy I know! I'm not thoughtless.If anything, my head goes in every direction when it comes to protecting you and Nanna Erina.You both are all I have to call "family." He has Jonathan's face, but he'll never be the gentleman that Jonathan was.That was the day I learned of Jojo's Ripple aptitude.So he inherited his grandfather's innate aptitude and talent for the Ripple.Yes.But why do you stray from the task at hand? What have you done?! I've just dispatched these men, and once I have dispatched you, Jonathan's nephew will be saddened, but he shall also bear a substantial grudge towards me.S-Straits-! Straits H-Have you gone off the deep end? No, I swim in the shallows, Speedwagon.I learned the Art of Mystics to discipline my body against the elements.But no matter the discipline I've attained all these years, my body continues to wither.I've become weak.I have ascended humanity, but not to a satisfactory degree.As the Ripple cannot halt the hands of time, I admit to having secretly yearned for all that Dio possessed, 50 years ago.His strength, his beauty, and his immortality! Long have I yearned for the blessings of the stone mask, no matter the lives of others I've sacrificed to attain them! Y-You really have gone off the deep end, Straits! With your blood, I shall acquire immortality, and the only remaining people who know of the stone mask would be both Erina and Joseph Joestar.Once I've k*lled them both, I shall dedicate my eternity to uncovering the mysteries of the stone mask that Dio could not! S-Stop, Straits We still know nothing about the stone mask's purpose Ms.Erina Jojo! Hey you! Watch where you're walking, you willy-nilly wack! Scram, you stupid schmo-schmuck-schmegeggy! Get outta the way already I beg your pardon? I'm sorry, you'll have to repeat everything you just said again.Slowly, say it again.And this time, keep your spiel in English.Stray from English, and you'll be cruising for a bruising.Jojo, what are you doing? N-Nanna Erina! What are you doing to that taxi driver? Um Well, I'm A taxi! I was catching a cab for you, Nanna Erina! My Jojo, that was very thoughtful of you.Mr.Smokey, do join us.Nanna Erina and Joseph were the last of their family, the last of the Joestar Estate.I learned a little about them in the cab Say Nanna, I know Great-Uncle Speedwagon was adamant about having us here in New York with him, but he's not even in town to greet us.The codger's probably on vacation! His work in the oil industry must be keeping him away.Say Nanna.Was Great-Uncle Speedwagon really just Grandpappy Jonathan's best mate, and nothing more? What are you suggesting? Well, that old codger's always been a bachelor, and you've never married, even after Grandpappy passed.I was simply curious as to whether or not anything ever happened between the two of you.How dare you disrespect your Great-Uncle! I'm sorry! I'll never say it again! Nanna, I'm sorry! I know Great-Uncle Speedwagon was Grandpappy's most faithful friend! Apparently, Joestar Estate heirs had always d*ed young.When Nanna Erina was young, her husband had d*ed on their honeymoon voyage.The boy she would give birth to would later wed the girl Nanna Erina saved during that unfortunate voyage, who would later gave birth to Jojo.Jojo's father lost his life to w*r, and his mother lost hers to sickness.Regardless, Nanna Erina stayed strong through those tough times.She's kindhearted to any and all, even to a rotten hood like myself.I wonder if it was all those lonesome years that made her warmth so comforting Jojo's got that same warmth.But it was that very kindhearted comfort that got us into trouble that night, all because of my color.Hey, waiter! Waiter! Yes, sir? Does your establishment cater to smelly swine? Does it?! The stench of that n*gro has ruined the very dish that I dine on! Kick that co*n out! Sir, our restaurant reserves the right to cater to any guest who decides to dine here, granted that they pay for their meal.Is that a fact?! You'll let this animal eat his own kind, will you?! I think I'd better go Jojo.Nanna, you wouldn't have me stay my hand, would you? I will not.Everybody is entitled to their own opinion.However, when that opinion besmirches the honor of a friend, I won't stand for it.Teach that boy some manners, without disturbing the other diners! Amen, Nanna.You're looking for a fight, buddy? I say, old boy! If you're looking for your knuckledusters, you won't find it in your coat pocket! It's in your rear pocket! It couldn't be Now you'll ask, "how the Hell did you know I had knuckledusters, you hooligan?!" How the Hell did you know I had knuckledusters, you hooligan?! Because the fingers on your right hand feature the bruises of knuckleduster usage, implying that you deploy them regularly for fights! Also, your dress shirt is stained with splattered blood! You worked up an appetite before dining tonight! And the very fact that the blood is on your dress shirt, and not your coat, means that you took off your coat before fighting! Therefore, one could only assume that you hid your knuckledusters in your rear pocket after fighting! You'll shout next, "what good will knowing about my knuckledusters do you, you little sh*t!" What good will knowing about my knuckledusters do you, you little sh*t?! Right in the kisser! That'll shut you up.I'll bet that hurt! It didn't.How could you mistake this for my face? Do you always throw blind punches, or are you just blind? I can read every fat, pompous pig like a book! But perhaps you were blinded to your true nature, Swine! Please, I'd like to apologize for my subordinate's behavior.Madam, you must be Erina Joestar.I was greatly indebted to our mutual friend, Mr.Speedwagon.When I was last in London, he told me a great deal about you.I'm quite relieved to meet you tonight.Hours ago, I came across unfortunate news that won't be public knowledge for a few days.Robert Edward O.Speedwagon has been m*rder*d.M-m*rder*d?! Rumor has it that his m*rder*r was a monk from Tibet.A monk from Tibet Do you mean Mr.Straits?! I don't know, but this news came from a man in Mexico who fished a few bodies out of a river, including Speedwagon's.Where and why he was m*rder*d, as well as the whereabouts of the monk, remain mysteries.I-I may know why he was m*rder*d It had to have dealt with the tale he told me ages ago About Dio and the stone mask His death must've involved one or the other Jojo, this man has mafia ties! You can't trust the Cosa Nostra! He's been paid to feed you lies! And you're entitled to your own opinion.Old boy, your Zippo's in your breast pocket.Smokey, I appreciate a mate's word of warning, but I'll have to trust his news.The Cosa Nostra's only business is making money, and greedy backstabbers like him pride themselves on the authenticity of their news! Nevertheless! Of all the filth that you could have frothed, you just had to pick the worst one to tell my nanna.How could you upset an elderly woman so?! You shameless scoundrel! Those terrible tales from 1888 have come back to haunt me Why! Fear not, Nanna Erina.I'll always be here for you.No Joseph! I fear for you! I fear that you'll share the same fate as your grandfather! There, there.If I am to perish as he had, then so be it.At the time, I was utterly at my wit's end.I had absolutely no idea about what their family had gone through.Hey, Smokey.It's chilly-chills tonight.Look at the Miriam Gates advert! What's it on? If girls wear these, will they make 'em more "bitchy?" Let's see "Boost your busts from double A's to shining C's." Lordy-lord, don't be bamboozled by this bull My You can get a pair for $1.25! Let's see now Somehow, I get the feeling that I've seen you before Well old boy, have we met before? Hey, how come you're not puffing cold clouds like I am? Also, I could've sworn I saw a pointy tooth sticking out of your mouth Say something, Straits.Be it in the streets or not, I shall silence you before your aptitude and talent peaks, Jojo! You'll silence me, will you? I knew he was loony, but "loony" doesn't do him justice! How could he open fire from an open street?! And just where in the world did he get his hands on a Tommy g*n?! I was awaiting your arrival, Straits! I know a few b*ll*ts won't be enough to slay you, but on behalf of Great-Uncle Speedwagon I'm going to w*r! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Vampires are strong, all right!

I can experiment all I want with my powers after I've k*lled you.And I will k*ll you, with the final technique Dio used against your grandfather! Empty, are you? I'll empty your skull with my highly-pressurized blood beams, which I call "Strait's Bloody Streams!" Die, Joseph! Jojo! Arrogance was your undoing.And now, only Erina Joestar remains.k*lling her is And now, you'll say, "like taking candy from a baby." like taking candy from a baby.Next, you'll ask, "how could he still be alive with that hole in his skull?" How could he still be alive with that hole in his skull?! Well Straits, if only you would've left your isolated temple in Tibet and seen the world, you might've actually learned something new.You could've k*lled me if you'd only been more attentive.Take a good gander at the face on this clock! Nanna Erina told me about how those beams were to blame for Grandpappy's demise! It was a mirror?! A bit slow on the uptake, aren't we? Straits! I've heard that the Ripple mimics the effect of sunlight on vampires! Enjoy this! I'll zap you to bits with this jolt! Now, Ripple energy supposedly melts the visage of vampires, so let's have a look-see.Y-You're not melting! You're not even dying, are you?! I suppose Nanna Erina forgot a detail or two! Unlikely.But I was right to assume that you would become a great thr*at to my existence.I'll let you in on my secret.This muffler was hand-knit from the dried microscopic bowels of 30,000 Satypolasia beetles, a species of beetles indigenous to Southeast Asia.This material conducts and disperses Ripple energy quicker than it does the human body, effectively neutralizing the Ripple.You could consider this muffler akin to a lightning conductor.I, Straits, am the successor and Lama to the 4,000-year-old Art of Mystics.You cannot hope to defeat one who knows everything there is to know about the Ripple! That is why Dio d*ed! And what a jolly good advert that was.But what makes you think that I'd limit myself to using the Ripple against you? Unlike you, I'm quick on the uptake! When and how did you attach a grenade to my muffler?! A pathetic parlor trick! You really could learn something new from seeing the world! Take a good gander at that grenade you just pulled! Impossible! H-He's a goner now! H-How could he still Smokey, don't look at 'im! Too late! Lord have mercy! Have mercy on my soul, for I shall do no wrong from this day forward, every day! Lordy-lord, have mercy on us all! H-He's a monster H-Hey Jojo, you got anything else up your sleeves? I do, indeed.You do? Yes, and it's my backup plan.S-So, what are you gonna do then? It's a relatively simple plan.Look at his legs.They've been blown to bits, but he's slowly building 'em up again.His recovery will take time.So, what's your simple plan? We're gonna use our legs! And do what, exactly? We're gonna skedaddle on outta here, Smokey! Clear the road, rubbernecks! That wack's really wacky! Pursue me, Straits! Hold up, Jojo! Though immortal, being blasted to bits takes a toll on the body, and requires a massive amount of energy for regeneration! This'll be great for the tabloids! The more pix I have, the more money I'll make! Lucky me! I'll be a real reporter in no time! His digits can exert pressure of up to 235 kg/cm^2! He can reach a height of up to 4.22 meters! I-Is there something behind me? We should be safe from him now I doubt that, Smokey.Can't you hear it? What's to hear, besides the running of the good ol' Hudson? Not the Hudson, but him! S-Save me! He found us! We gotta run! This woman is my hostage! If you attempt to flee, I'll k*ll her! But if you can rise to the occasion, I'll release her! You're pulling me leg here! Why would I risk my arse for some broad, you bozo?! Jojo, we gotta go! I present a trial to you! If you flee and leave the woman to my mercy, then you are nothing more than a coward! No longer shall I pursue you, for that blast has left me debilitated and fatigued, but I will never acknowledge you as Speedwagon's avenger.However, should you choose to face me, then I shall acknowledge your courage! You will become a great thr*at to my very existence.But before your talent manifests, I shall exhaust every ounce of my energy into k*lling you! You have five seconds before her head flies! Make those five seconds count! If I had a sweetheart for you to take, I'd bust your bozo butt, but instead, you picked a no-name hideous homegirl for a hostage! Then you wouldn't mind if I destroy her jaw and tear out her throat, while pulling out every organ inside her body as she still breathes.I doubt proud the successor and Lama to the Art of Mystics would commit such cruelty against a woman Th-That's her wisdom tooth! Hot damn, he pulled out her wisdom tooth! You son of a bitch! You really pulled out her tooth! I shall show no mercy! Screw you Straits! You asked for it! You're nothing but a vicious vampire now! And you're an atrocious actor, but I knew you were easy to enrage.I'll slash you down to size, Straits! Die! I just figured out a way to b*at those beams! You nicked me the second time, but you won't catch me off guard the third! Rippled! Wha-! Tha-! "That's impossible," is it? That's impossible! I deflected your bloody beams with Rippled sh*t glasses, because I knew you couldn't resist blasting my brain.Your pattern's just too plain! I want you to beg for Great-Uncle Speedwagon's forgiveness in Hell! You can rest easy starting tonight, Nanna.Why did you halt my descent? For all you know, I might have the strength to take that right arm of yours off! Then do it, for chrissake! Just know that if you do, I'll bash your skull in with ol' Lefty here! Answer me this.Why would you toss Great-Uncle's corpse into the river?! It just doesn't add up to me! Joseph You really have inherited Jonathan's every trait.Unlike Jonathan, you are impulsive and easy to enrage, but you possess his penchant for adventuring and meticulous meddling! I shall sate your curiosity and reveal the events that you have now been entangled in! What "events?" They shall unfold in good time.Beginning with the Man in the Pillar! He'll be the one to change your ways! Could you be any more ambiguous, you damn bozo?! I let their bodies be carried by the river because of him.He began sucking the blood of the men I k*lled, alike a tree intaking its nutrients from the soil.This sight unsettled me which is why I discarded their bodies in the river.But I'm certain his awakening is close at hand! His awakening from two long millenia of sleep! Joseph You shall encounter him soon, and he shall be the one to change your views on man's very existence and evolution! Once you know what he is, you'll understand the machinations of our maker.I-Is that the Ripple?! You've channeled the Ripple within your very body?! I regret nothing.Brief as this was, I am content with descending into the depths of Hell in my youth, rather than wither away as an elder.Regaining my youth was the greatest ecstasy I could've ever hoped for.Wait, Straits! I'm not finished yet! Farewell, Jojo! Jojo In 1938, the world would be torn asunder with the advent of World w*r II.The ambitions of the Third Reich ran rampant throughout the w*r.They brought the most technological advancements in Chemistry, Astrology, Sorcery, Alchemy, the Paranormal, and the Occult, all into the w*r! They mastered every existing academic discipline known to man, and waged w*r against the world.Even Straits actions Mexico were no secret from the intelligence they gathered at their base in Mexico.F-Forgive my slip, Mayor Stroheim! I-I just lost control over my hand! Lick it.You cut my cheek, ja? Lick my cheek, and everything will be wunderbar.Okey! Be slow and steady with your tongue.Be gentle, FrÃ¤ulein.Be steady because I can't feel any pain now.Be careful now! It's very sharp, ja! Excuse me, SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim! The injured old man we rescued from the Rio Grande has regained consciousness! We can begin extracting information from him immediately! Hey, give me a sign.What's your name, Toots? I could give you a lift home if you need.What was that for?! You called me a "hideous homegirl," didn't you?! Well consider that punch payback, you big ham! Did I really? Indeedy-do.You were rippin' that fool for taking a no-name hideous homegirl hostage.Really? Golly gee whiz, how could I ever call a such a sexy sweetie hideous? Maybe a little pain will help you remember your words, Jagoff! You busty bitch! Now that she's not numb from fear, she's screaming in agony.And I'm concerned about that "Man in the Pillar" Straits was singing about.Make way for me, Mexico! How do you fare, Herr Speedwagon? Tell me if you've ever heard of this European aphorism before."When an elder takes his own life, his village shall soon be doomed." Perhaps the elder took an unspeakable secret with him, as you had attempted.Does that secret concern him?! We excavated the pillar from the location of those ruins that we extracted from you.O Father in Heaven! Why do I not recall the events that he speaks of?! Why didn't you leave me at Death's Door?! It was not by His hand, Herr Speedwagon.I was the one who saved you from Death's Door, and it was the m*llitary might of the Third Reich that coerced your revelation! Though you are elderly, we know that even under interrogation, you would never break your silence.You crossed the Atlantic a penniless pauper, and as you slowly starved in the deserts of Texas, you chanced upon crude oil.Now, your very foundation may alter the course of any economy in the world.But that pales in comparison to the medical advancements of the Third Reich! Our ambition shall overcome all! You used a truth serum! But what else is there to gain from me?! We need to know everything! Everything that you know! Everything that transpired in your past between Straits and the Joestars! Anything we can use to awaken the Man in the Pillar! D-Don't! You don't know what you're getting yourself into! He's a greater thr*at than that of the Third Reich! Prepare the subject's chamber for massive blood injections! This experiment must succeed! No quiero morir! LÃ­brame! I have a suggestion.Everybody must collectively determine a sacrifice.We require blood for our experiments, and if one must die, then let it be the one that you all choose.Once everyone's decided, you'll all be freed today.I-I will be your sacrifice! If I die, at least the others will be free! Very well, boy.I commend courageous boys with bravery as big as yours, ja? Only the brave may live to serve the Third Reich.Spare the boy and execute the others! Commence the experiment! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Your ignorance will cost you your life! I've brought a yank for your cells.Was it you who dare disturb my slumber? He's going into the ventilation shaft?! Episode The Man in the Pillar

They can't.Perhaps it's plain paranoia You have superior senses.Even bats would fail to find any trace of my trail in the night, but you have done so in the day! Who the Hell're you?! Why're you trailing me tail?! I am stalking you! By order of mein Reich, I am to capture and extract any information you retain regarding Straits, Joseph Joestar! R-Regarding Straits?! Mein Reich?! Shijima no soko kara Once, four folks from the fires of Hell mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.Shinku no chishio ga Their ambition for power assembled tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru the blood of a few bombastic braves.Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger! Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite He would exploit the flaws of the foes he faced!

Atsuku like a bloody storm Blazing bloody into a storm, ketsumyaku ni kizamareta innen ni but would he be free of the cursed fate of his family? Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna Who can say, but the bonds of these braves nigirishimete will never be buried.in the Pillar The Man Episode Say Stalker Your m*llitary mug and Stormtrooper speech reeks of sauerkraut! What relation do you Jerries have with either Straits or Speedwagon?! Cough it up! Elsewise, I'll b*at it outta you! You would dare to duel Donovan, an honorary SS-Sturmmann of the Third Reich, unarmed?! You insult me, you stupid civilian! You can have your ragged carpet back! C-Cactus spines! Hurra! You'll have to become an elite soldier if you ever hope defeat me, kind! Repeat after me! "Herr Donovan speaks the truth!" Herr Donovan speaks the truth You'll have to enunciate more, ja? You're a hard Herr to hit with those fast feet of yours, so I figured it'd be better to strike you when stationary! Exactly, how does immobility alleviate you of your current predicament? Why does this kaktus expand? Have a good gander, Jerry! I wanted you to whack me to that cactus! Y'see, 95% of a cactus is composed of water, meaning that I may manipulate any cactus's composition with the Ripple! Now cough it up, Donovan! I want to know everything you know! He's alive.I was afraid the location of Great-Uncle's body might've remained a mystery I had a feeling But now, I know he's alive.He's alive, and that's the best news I could ask for! If I could tell Nanna Erina the news now, she'd be so sunny! But no matter what the Jerries do to him, I'll be there to bail him out.And we'll be back home to see Nanna Erina's sweet smile again! S-Scheisse! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim! Fissures have begun forming across the pillar! We've already injected five adults-worth of blood! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, we still know nothing of the subject's abilities.Perhaps we should be cautious with the amount of blood we inject! Ja.But how does the Man in the Pillar absorb the blood of our prisoners? Wait, don't bother answering! Why listen when I can imagine, instead? Herr Speeeeedwagooon! What's got you shaking? Why do you seem so distressed? Your ignorance and conceit shall cost us all our lives! Listen to me.That chamber is a shelter of sorts.The iron plates lining the walls are all 50 centimeters thick.That chamber is fitted with flamethrowers, machine g*ns, and even a time-b*mb.You're in the safest zoo in the world, and you still fear the growls of caged Grizzlies! Have no fear! Although he was preserved in a pillar for eons, he is nothing more than a troglodyte in tatters to SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim! We have a leak! It's blood! The blood we've been injecting into the pillar is being purged! The blood's obstructing our observations! Cleanse the chamber with a shower! The subject has shed his stone-skin, and his body now appears smooth and supple, with a lustrous shine to it! The subject is organic! It bears similar traits to h*m* sapiens! He needs a name, ja? The "Man in the Pillar" tires the tongue.I shall do a godfather's duty and christen the child! And it shall mean "the withering winds of Mexico," Santana! Santana of Mexico! He's rising to his feet! Now, stand for me! Display your talents for our eyes to behold, Santana! Intriguing! Santana's scratching his head and it's very intriguing, ja? This is the "Omnipotent Organism?!" What's so "omnipotent" about him?! Speculate, Herr Speedwagon! He's ascertaining his surroundings through smell! He's like a confounded caveman! I'll bet he doesn't have an ounce of intelligence, ja? Oh, the hilarity.Nevertheless, we shall designate "Santana" as the creator of the Stone Mask.Sturmmann, commence the second stage of our experiment.Release the subject's stimulus from confinement.Jawohl! Wh-What in God's name is that?! A prisoner.We forced him to wear the Stone Mask.S-So he's vampire now! Until a few days ago, he was an ill, toothless elder near Death's Door.He hasn't had his fill of blood today, so he's eager to quench his thirst! He's a volatile vampire! We'll have to see how Santana reacts to this stimulus! How could he be defeated so quickly?! He's as brittle as a human being! If we lose the subject now, without any data, the experiment will have been for naught! The prisoner had an expl*sive device transplanted into his head! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim, should we detonate it?! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer! Detonate the device! S-Stopp! Don't detonate the b*mb! L-Look at what's become of his chin, his mandible! A-And look at his arms They're inside Santana! I was foolish to assume Santana's demise, since Santana was actually absorbing the prisoner's body! Santana's absorbing the prisoner's body as if he's devouring it! What sort of "Omnipotent Organism" is he?! Santana used his entire body to devour the vampire's as his breakfast! A-And now that he's eaten, the vampire's energy shall surge throughout his body! Mein Gott! He's devoured the vampire! With his body! A-And his body's grown substantially! Calm your concerns! The subject remains trapped in an impregnable shelter! Only his body mass has increased from devouring the vampire! Wh-What What of his intelligence? Does he display sapience?! S-Strohe-im! S-Strohe-im! S-Strohe-im! Impossible! He spoke?! H-He spoke my name, too! He shouldn't be able to hear a single decibel from within that chamber, either! According to Donovan the Pincushion, there's a high-security facility located 20-meters underneath that villa.Great-Uncle Speedwagon's bound to be there.But how can I get in, first? Only canned goods, eggs, ham, meats, and vegetables are permissible for carriage beyond this point! Achtung! Everybody gets a frisking! What's the matter now? Smile for me while I frisk you, FrÃ¤ulein! Smile for me and flip those skirts! You may pass! NÃ¤chste! I've brought tequila for your throats, so won't you let me pass, por favor? Hands up, now! Move, and we'll sh**t! What have I done to deserve such treatment?! He's moving, Hansel! Feuer! Don't sh**t me! I-I won't move anymore, I promise! Crikey! You Jerries really do have eagle eyes! Nobody could've seen through this disguise! You Dummkopf! Anyone could've seen through that disguise! What kind of woman could ever have as much muscle as you, Trottel?! You're a fool to think that your face could ever be as fair as a FrÃ¤ulein's! Come again?! Rippled! Â¡Caramba! You Jerry jerks My face is fair.Hopefully, things will go smoother with this disguise.Wh-What happened?! I-I don't know! You mean you weren't watching?! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim, I-I looked away for a brief moment You were there, as were the others.But none of us were looking at him Concentrate on me, not the coffee! I-It was very brief I looked away for just a few seconds.I even have a visual acuity of 1.5! But even I couldn't see what took place within! What I still can't believe is how he managed to vanish from this sealed chamber! There is no trace of physical damage to the walls, either! We just need to be collectively calm and search him out! He must've hidden himself somewhere, where we have no eyes! Cut off the oxygen supply to the chamber! He'll reappear once asphyxiation kicks in! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, we've finished developing the surveillance footage.Take it to the movie projector! Jawohl! Start the reel.He's running towards the wall! Th-Then is he?! O-Oh mein Gott! He's gone up the ventilation shaft! H-How could he possibly break his body to fit into that 4-by-20-centimeter slit?! Th-This is terrible! He didn't just break his body! He shattered every bone in his skeleton, just so he could squeeze into that slit! Th-Then that means he's hidden himself somewhere within the ventilation system of this facility! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, do you recall Santana's first words? It was your name! He must've heard it through the chamber's ventilation exhausts! Then this control center is connected to the chamber's ventilation shaft?! Sturmmann, step away from the ventilation shaft's exhaust! Jetzt! S-Santana's struck the Sturmmann! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim What's happened?! It's so dark, and I can't see a thing! Why are the lights out?! Santana snuck himself into that stormtrooper's body! Mein BrÃ¼der, where have you all gone?! Don't leave me behind! I don't know why, but I've never felt so alive until now! What have we done? If Santana escapes, he will become a thr*at to the ambition and existence of das Vaterland! He must die! Santana must be slain! sh**t him! Send off our fallen Sturmmann with a symphony of shells! He's still alive! As I feared! Machine g*ns just aren't enough to k*ll him! How can he stand?! Why's he pointing his finger at us? What's he trying to do?! W-Wait! He's mimicking the barrel of a g*n! Perhaps he's merely mimicking our actions! M-My name was the only one he's uttered so far, because that's the only one he's ever heard! There's no logic to mere mimicry! P-Perhaps he has no mental capacity for sapience! If he can only mimic our actions without any reasoning, he can be controlled! Was it you Teutonic tribesmen who dared to disturb my dreams? H-He formed a sentence! It's no "monkey see, monkey do" with him! H-He's demonstrating an advanced degree of sapience! He's already ascertained our speech of the English language! Now die.What?! H-He's absorbed and accumulated our b*ll*ts in order to fire them from his finger! Herr Oldboy, I suggest you come with me and stay hidden for a while! He'll start f*ring his fingers off in any second! Nay! I desire no assistance from men of the Third Reich! Well gee whiz Even when you're in a pickle, you're still the same stubborn codger.H-He perplexes my mind to no end! S-Stay away! Hello Jerry, I'll be needing your hair.A bundle of it, in fact.Au-aua-autsch! What are you doing to me?! Pulling out a bit of the ol' Barnet! How dare you offend the hair of an Offizier! Who are you? I-Impossible, I recognize that impulsiveness! I call this my Barnet Fair Ripple! It you! It really is you, Joseph Joestar! Barnet Barrier! Jerry, your Aryan hair's looking pretty limp! Spruce it up a bit with a splash of egg white to prevent balding, Stormtrooper.How on Earth did you find me?! Hello, Great-Uncle! Ha ir I'll tell you later, because I've gotten myself into one smelly pickle.I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time So this is what true sapience means! He's got me shaking! SeÃ±or Santana, let's sing! Enough, you pathetic caveman! He's absorbing my leg through its wound! Episode Jojo VS.The Omnipotent Organism

You listen to me, and you listen well.Santana is responsible for creating the Stone Mask, which he uses to transform humans in order to absorb their potent vampiric powers.He is a thr*at to humanity! Santana must be k*lled! Be careful, Jojo! Think fast! I caught you off guard, you chatty chap.Top o' the mornin' to ya.Nice tae meit ye! Nice tae meit ye! SeÃ±or Santana, lets speak some Scottish!

Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna Who can say, but the bonds of these braves nigirishimete will never be buried.Jojo VS.the Omnipotent Organism Episode Nice tae meit ye! Why are you trying to confuse him?! Are you trying to get yourself k*lled?! Honestly, who could really say that he's bad to the bone? I'm trying to get acquainted with him.I think that if you treated him nice from the start, he might've cooperated.Don't be so delusional! He m*rder*d all of my men! So what? You Limburger-smelling bastards deserved it! I would want you dead too, if you treated me like a guinea pig and sh*t at me! As for why I'm here, I came to bring Great-Uncle Speedwagon back to the Big Apple.I have no quarrel with SeÃ±or Santana here.So sing with me! Nice tae meit ye! Where are his manners? He just brushed me off without a single glance.I'm pretty perturbed now.Fine.I'll trip him up and make him kiss the floor in return! H-He walked through me leg?! A-And what was that feeling I just felt?! What is this "thing?" What purpose does this "thing" serve? New sentences! He's made many comprehendible sentences now, which means that he's already mastered the syntactic rules of Modern English! H-Hot damn! He's disassembling that machine g*n like a watchmaker to his watch! It requires hours of undeterred focus and attention to learn g*n disassembly, and yet H-He is demonstrating that he does possess the mental capacity to learn! Luminous Never, have I beheld such luminance Your people didn't take any lessons away from this experiment, but he took plenty from us all! Say SeÃ±or! If you can speak, then return my greetings! Anybody home? Jojo, stop that! Enough of your begging, you caveman of contempt! Holy mackerel! Ribcage Ripper! Also known as versatilis cavea thoracis! Any rib may be retracted to protrude externally outside the thoracic wall! Jojo! Scintillae? Only flint and tinder can create scintillae I could not devour this human and he was lofted away.Nor could I devour his leg, either.Never have I met so unusual a human.Is this human the only one with such talents, or are all the humans of this era the same as him? He is the only one with such talents.Jojo! He's in my head! Great-Uncle Get your stinking mitts outta my Great-Uncle! You are bad to the bone! I'm gonna bust your bad butt into a bust for The Met! Humans have evolved some, since I was last awake.Take a big bite outta my Ripple-sandwich! Th-The Ripple's making blood float off the floor?! It's not hurting him! My Ripple energy's being dispersed over his body and onto the floor, like rain running off a trench coat, causing the blood to float! His flesh works exactly like Straits's muffler because it acts like a lightning conductor! This human's energies are repelling my own M-My hand is whole! W-Well whaddya know? Curling my fist down to my wrist in a split kept my hand whole! But golly gee whiz, the Ripple's useless against him.What do I do now? You're wrong! It's not completely useless! The Ripple is acting as a barrier against him! It's preventing his body from devouring you whole! What good does that do him?! It's like eating Kugelfisch, ja? k*ll it first, and then remove all the parts with tetrodotoxin before eating! The Ripple is the tetrodotoxin to Santana, but he need only k*ll him first! What a pickle of a predicament this is! There has to be a way! At least a way outta here, so that we all survive! No, you Dummkopf!! Santana must not escape! He's a grave thr*at to all humanity! Shuddap! It was you and your Jerries who got us into this mess to begin with! And now, you expect me to save all of humanity because of your idiocy?! I'll bet I can channel the Ripple into you with this Kn*fe! His skin's like rubber, and it's stopping the Kn*fe from tearing though! But how will you manage to avoid me now?! I'll channel the Ripple straight into your sockets! This plan'll work like a charm! B-Bloody Hell! He rendered his whole head rubbery! Jump away while you still can, Jojo! Jojo! His diaphragm's been struck hard, so he'll be gasping for a while! So, the human's energies are born from his blood and breathing.However, he is a mere mortal when unconscious.Jojo! Use Ripple Respiration! Respire, goddammit! For the love of God, use Ripple Respiration! Jojo! Th-That's it! I'm gonna blow us all to kingdom come! May the Third Reich live for ein-TausendjÃ¤hr-! Stop that speech, Stroheim! Keep your pantyhose on! I was waiting for this from the get-go! If I couldn't get past his skin, then I'd get under his skin! I figured I could channel the Ripple from within him! Jojo! I was waiting for you to take the bait! Here comes the clincher! Be Rippled to shreds! I-I get it now! After seeing into his stomach, I understand how his spooky body absorbed everything he devoured! Every cell in his body secretes gastric acid for digestion, which breaks down anything his body devours! That explains why his body can devour others, and grow from absorbing those nutrients! I'm only whole because I channeled the Ripple into him before his cells began secretion! Still, your Ripple powers aren't developed enough! He survived the Ripple you channeled because it lacked potency! Trying to put yourself back together, eh? I saw how Straits did it during our duel, so I was waiting for you to do the same! Stroheim! Stay sharp, Stormtrooper! Can sunlight k*ll him?! I-It can, Herr Joestar! The murals in the ruins depicted the very effect of sunlight! Sunlight can k*ll Santana! That is why he created the Stone Mask, to withstand sunlight! Why are you showing him the way out, Herr Joestar?! We can't let him escape from here! I'm gonna let the sunlight finish the job I started! Joseph's gasping for air! He's fought well without discipline, but without Ripple Respiration training, he can't store Ripple energy for prolonged fights! This is as far as you will go, you contemptible caveman! Jojo! Respire, goddammit! I'd love to, but keeping this k*ller- diller from k*lling me is exhausting! Why did you have to be such a pisser?! Now, I'm gonna drag your arse up these stairs, and personally watch you burn to death! What the-?! I feel heavy M-My body's being weighed down! Wh-What in the bloody Hell's going on?! Brawn Bloodsuckers! Also known as sarcosanguisuga! Santana's flesh is stuck to him! Th-They're sucking my blood! Y-You trifling twit! Sunlight! You are the first human I have met with such mettle since my awakening.SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim shall unleash the sunlight! All that remains is opening this door.It's the least I can do.S-Stroheim You insolent idiots I was only centimeters away, too! Cease your struggle.Good grief! Herr Joestar! Do me a favor! What ever could it be, goddammit?! I'm trying to figure out a way outta this pickle, so shut your trap! Listen to me! Do you see those axes on that wall? Grab one, and use it to sever my leg! C-Come again?! Cut my leg off, Dummkopf! Once you do, I can reach the doorknob! W-Why the Hell would you even ask me to cr*pple you?! Be quick about it! His body will begin accumulating soon! Shuddap! I'm not a g*dd*mn surgeon, so don't even ask me again! I am an honorary SS-SturmbannfÃ¼hrer of the Third Reich! I was disposed to death the moment I accepted this assignment! I would willingly give both my legs and arms for the sake of das Vaterland! He's almost whole, Herr Joestar! I told you to shuddap! Keep nagging me, and I really will cut your g*dd*mn leg off! CUT MY LEG OFF! Blimey! I thought he was all title and no talent, but he's really willing to go all the way! My hat's off to you for your dedication to your duty, Stroheim! Timber! And now, I'm gonna enjoy watching you burn to death! Is he dead? Wh-What's he doing?! He's going up through the wound in my leg! No you don't! I-I don't believe it! He burrowed himself inside Stroheim's body, instead of mine! Santana's inside my body! Th-This monster just won't take a hint! His tenacity towards life is extraordinary! So long as he stays inside Stroheim, he'll remain immune to sunlight! W-Wunderbar Terrifically wunderbar! Would you like to know what's so wunderbar? I can't feel the crippling pain in my leg any longer! In fact, it feels absolutely euphoric! Stroheim! A-A grenade?! Y-You wouldn't! Herr Joestar! Today, you have witnessed the feats of Santana, the Omnipotent Organism! Now that he's within me, I'm as good as dead.At the very least, I know I'll be taking him with me.But before I'm blown, I need to divulge to you our intelligence.My only regret is that I'll be informing an enemy of the Third Reich! We didn't awaken Santana in the middle of a Mexican desert without good reason! Whaddya mean?! Why're you telling me now?! Listen! You have an obligation to hear what I have to say! Our researchers in the Third Reich located others like Santana in the catacombs of a certain city in Europe! I-It can't be! Speak sense and say it ain't so, Stroheim! Santana wasn't the only Man in the Pillar we found The Third Reich has sought to uncover the mysteries of an ancient species of h*m* which existed nearly 2,000 years ago, known as "Pillar Men." They will be awakened soon, and if we cannot discover any other susceptibilities aside from sunlight, humanity as we know it will be doomed! For this reason, we awakened Santana in order to collect data on his abilities and vulnerabilities! In 1888, your grandfather started the w*r against the Stone Mask, but now, it is your obligation, your fate, to end that w*r! Herr Joestar! Your Ripple powers are far too flaccid to be effective against them! Head for Rome! There is a Ripple Master in Rome! Herr Speedwagon is well-acquainted with this master! S-Santana's using my body to try and escape into that well! But the moment I explode, Santana will be exposed to sunlight! Stroheim Why?! "The might of mankind is made ever evident, as it stands stalwart in the face of fear." These were the words of the great Greek bibliographer, Plutarchus.Auf Wiedersehen.I bid you farewell, you accursed island ape! Don't do it! I still have more to ask! Goddammit, you stupid stormtrooper! Why'd you have to be so selfless?! Santana!!! Step aside! Failure to obey shall result in death, Jojo! I need to store Ripple energy through Ripple Respiration! Fly aside! I felt naught but an apathetic intent to k*ll from that clash! A-And now you'll say, "you cannot defeat me, you contemptuous caveman!" You cannot defeat me, you contemptuous caveman! It's about midday now, meaning that the sunlight from above will begin refracting off the water below! You're like an overcooked full breakfast now! The thought of a sundial should've crossed your mind before you leapt into a trap, caveman! I won't let you hit the water until you're dead! Th-The sunny-sun saved my buns and the sunlight's completely turned him into stone! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Your grandfather caused mine to die! At least I can attract these pigeons! We're in control so long as these UV rays still shine! Awaken, my masters! Episode The Onmipotent Organisms of Yore

The subject is being exposed to ultraviolet light.Please put on this mask.Send in the snake! The snake's been absorbed! Santana still lives! Absorbing organisms within his proximity is his defense mechanism! Without exposure to UV rays, he would regain mobility.Inconceivable! How can this creature be k*lled?! What steps can be taken against an immortal organism that devours even vampires?! Do not be too concerned, Mr.Speedwagon.So long as we keep Santana exposed to our artificial UV rays, he won't regain mobility.Indeed, he won't! That's one less thing for us to worry about.With time on our side, we'll be able to complete a thorough analysis for any susceptibilities.This photograph was taken in the cavernous ruins from which Santana was excavated.Look closely.They each have horns of various shapes protruding from their skulls! If the subject at the very bottom is a depiction of Santana, who could these three be?! According to the late Major, the Third Reich has discovered these remaining three subjects in the catacombs of Rome.Those Krauts! From the positioning of the Pillar Men in this mural, it may be depicting an inherent form of social stratification.Jojo and I will follow the last lead of the late Major, and fly to Rome to meet a Ripple user.That Ripple user is the grandson of the Will A.Zeppeli Caesar Zeppeli! Say Signora, from where do you hail? Come to watch the water, have you? Would you like your picture taken with it? The pigeons of Rome are rather receptive to rubbernecks, though I can't say the same for Casanova over there! Come now, boys! I've made the introductions, so at least give each other a proper greeting! Signor Speedwagon, I'd like to make one thing clear.In 1888, upon the death of my grandfather, my father willingly devoted his life to uncovering the mysteries of the Stone Mask! In Italy, the charge of a father becomes his childrens'! I have devoted myself as he, for an honorable charge it be! But what of his charge?! Until three months ago, he hadn't a single clue of his grandfather's past! I have no respect for a man who doesn't care for his clan! Say that again! Say it, and I'll make you regret it! Caesar, you're mistaken.I was the one who kept everything about his grandfather a secret from him.Then that matter is settled.You piqued my interest when you said that he defeated both Straits and a Man in the Pillar, and so I waited in the hotel's ristorante to judge him for myself.After witnessing his Ripple powers, I was disappointed to say the least.His powers lack potency! I'm willing to bet that the Man in the Pillar tripped into the well! You-! I refuse to lend a hand to this flaccid frocio! The only reason he lacks control is because he's not formally-! The time for talk is over, Great-Uncle.I'm gonna cream this queenie here.Unlikely.Your Ripple powers aren't even potent enough to overpower this woman.In that case, I'd wager that yours couldn't curb these birds! You're irking me, Eyetie! I love irking others, but I can't stand being irked! Y-You've manipulated the lady with a Rippled Kiss?! Mi ripeto.Your powers aren't potent enough to overpower that woman.Sh-Should I intervene? No.It's a trying test, but if he cannot overcome this trial, he'll never learn.You proved my point.Because of your grandfather's incompetence, William A.Zeppeli met an unfortunate end! I refuse to keep the company of any Joestar! Caesar, that's enough! Th-That's it You can irk me all you like, but I won't let you besmirch the memory of my grandfather! I have a technique that can k*ll the Pillar Men! A breathtaking technique! The Ripple Bubble Blaster! I have concealed in my gloves and guise devices for dispensing specialized soap bubbles! Fly back to the zoo from whence you came, you filthy animal! I can't-! I'll commend you for keeping conscious, but your feeble Ripple powers won't burst my bubbles.I've noticed that your respiration is in disarray now.Asphyxiate for all I care! Now you'll say, "Signorina, I'll undo my magical Ripple now." Signorina, I'll undo my magical Ripple now.When you had her choke me, I snuck a Rippled dove down her throat.I knew you couldn't resist kissing her to undo your Rippled Kiss, Casanova! I repeat.I knew your Ripple powers couldn't curb those birds! For chrissakes What is this queenie's contention? What kind of obnoxious twat needs to prance their rear into a rocker? This eyetie irks me to no end.The mook's mocking me just because he has that unique technique.I guess I'll have to make up my own.Oh, but the required effort on my behalf doesn't warrant it.I'll show him who's King 'round here, with my card technique! What's the meaning of this, Jojo? Deal the cards straight.They are straight.Looks pretty crooked to me.You won't sneak any cheat by me! W-Well whaddya know? The cat's outta the bag.Not surprising though, since the only way you could ever b*at me is by cheating.Then would you care to explain the shiny polish of your shoe, cheater? Got a problem, wildman?! I do indeed, Eyetie! Caesar! Do tell me what we've been sitting here, waiting eight whole hours for.What are we waiting for? Our escort, of course! Hey, that's one of Third Reich's Jerries! We're clear to go.The Third Reich has the catacombs placed under heavy surveillance.He's our ride inside.He is?! Germany and Italy share an alliance, and the Third Reich's dying to make scientific sense of my Ripple powers.And the only reason they've allowed you two Englishmen entryway into the catacombs was because I practically begged them to let you see the Pillar Men.Herr Speedwagon.We require the intelligence you possess.Before they awaken, we need your help to discover any susceptibilities they may have.Say Mark, how fares your sweetheart back in Germany? F-Funny you should mention her When I return home next week, we're going to get married! You are?! Mamma mia! Congratulazioni! Y'know, I was the one who taught Mark how to find this girl through flirting, sÃ¬? Great, but could you watch where you're driving?! Get your bloody chin off of the steering wheel already! On that note, Jojo, you wouldn't happen to have a sweetheart, would you? I doubt you would.What kind of girl would want a wildman like you? You'd have better luck locating Nessie than finding yourself a sweetheart! Clam it, Casanova! You're really irking on me nerves! I need to come up with my own Ripple technique to prove my prowess! There's something amiss, ja? Wh-What's with that hole?! Keep calm! They're trapped under UV ray exposure and cannot move! Analyze the cavity, but proceed with the utmost caution! Jawohl! The sacrifice of SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim and his squad have taught us to be cautious with Pillar Men.Once we've excavated the subjects from these catacombs, we'll have them sealed in a bunker in das Vaterland.How did this cavity appear? There's not enough light to see inside.Try looking in there.I-I can hear something A horn! Th-The subject couldn't have awakened! Set the radiation output on those lights to maximal! Jawohl! I-It's blocked the UV lights with a mix of blood and bodily fluids! I pondered the state of Man's strength after two millenia of slumber but dependence upon such lackluster luminance imply declination.I-It speaks! The lucent tools of Teutons mayn't withhold the will of Wham! Our hands are joined! Whammo! Awaken, my masters! So, la Bocca della VeritÃ  leads to the catacombs containing the Pillar Men! Overwhelming is this ghastly ambiance Caesar, have you ever tried channeling Ripple energy through those monsters? The Ripple is only effective against living matter, and therefore, has very little effect against their bodies while petrified.In order for the Ripple to have any effect, they'd have to awaken.I thought you said there was heavy surveillance! Looks pretty empty around these parts! It's too quiet, I tell you! Then why don't you keep it quiet? H-He's right.The SS of the Third Reich are nowhere in sight.For certain? Hey, I think I just stepped on something! The sound of it was something quite atrocious! What in the Hell is this?! Th-These are Skins of the SS! Th-They've been exterminated! It can't be! Jerry, get your silly keister back here! Th-There's something over there! Bloody Hell! Good Heavens! Th-They're already awake! Run Mark, run! Mark!!! Mark?! Caesar save me! Mark! They didn't pay us any heed! From their lack of reaction and the way that their man just devoured this poor Jerry they disregard human life in the same manner that we do when stepping on ants! The world beyond is enshrouded in darkness, is it not? It is, Master Khars.What is the will of my masters? We shall seize the eve and seek out the Red Stone of Aja.Once we find it, we will insert it into this impression, and the Stone Mask shall be supreme.Be that as it may, Master Esidisi, human civilization has greatly evolved since we were last awake.It was rumored that the Roman Emperor, Julius Caesar, possessed the Red Stone of Aja, but neither he nor his empire may be remaining in this era.Then we must seek the current whereabouts of the Red Stone of Aja.The prized possession of the Roman Emperor mayn't go unnoticed nor unheard by his subjects, the populace.I shall seek and procure the Red Stone of Aja.All in good time.For the moment, let us ascend these depths and observe the state of human civilization.Wham! How dare you strike at your superior! Enough, Esidisi! A thousand pardons, Master Khars! You always did detest the act of having your shadow tread upon, and I had perished the thought of the conditioned consequences.Two millenia have passed since our slumber.I've wronged my master and his retribution be just! Deliver upon me the justice that is due! I wouldn't dare maim my loyal servant.Rather, I require that your conditioned reflexes remain, for my own sake.It was I who wronged you by treading upon your shadow.Forgive me, Wham.Master Khars Come, Wham.Aiens! Caesar! k*ll me! k*ll me, now! Mark! Th-The pain is returning to me! It hurts! The pain is starting to overwhelm the numbness from shock I beg of you to k*ll me, Caesar! Mark! I-I can't help him! I can't do a damn thing for the guy! I can't help but feel gut-wrenching guilt right now! C-Caesar You Grazie, Caesar Mark! Mark was a normal man A normal man who gave everything for his family, his sweetheart, and his country.He was a normal, hardworking man who was devoted to his duty He was just a normal man! Caesar! Jojo, this quarrel doesn't concern you! I will avenge him! For my own sanity, I have to avenge him! Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching Down on the land Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees The rim of the land The eagle's dancing wings create as weather Spins out of hand Go closer hold the land feel partly no more Than grains of sand We stand to lose all time a thousand answers By in our hand Next to your deeper fears we stand Surrounded by million years I'll be the roundabout The words will make you out 'n' out I'll be the roundabout The words will make you out 'n' out Next Time Be a bit more sporting, why dont'cha?

I really hate to admit it, but Caesar's bubbles do pack a punch! You're surrounded and trapped by my bubbles now! I'll keep the bubble barrier up until you all burst! H-He burst your bubbles Your Bubble Blaster! He didn't burst them by making contact with the braids on his circlet, either.The wind he made from waving those braids burst my bubbles! So his circlet protects him from any Ripple energy! They understand the Art of Mystics doctrines! They must've made contact with Ripple users over two-thousand years ago! Wh-What is this force that surrounds these three?! Caesar, get down now! I-I'm bleeding? Close your eyes! He didn't just create wind! He created waves of miniature whirlwind projectiles! Caesar! The Mystics survived The descendants of those meddling mystics we annihilated two millenia ago waited in these very catacombs for our awakening? One cut or two to my face shall not assuage my anger! I shall have vengeance, even if it costs me both eyes! Wh-Why do you scoff at me so?! The Mystics always spoke similar as you.In fact, every Mystic we encountered during our search for the Red Stone of Aja spoke similar as you."I will k*ll you, even if it costs my arms and eyes." "I shall have vengeance for the death of my companion!" We scoff at your simplicity.V-Vaffanculo! Let us begin our search for the Red Stone of Aja.H-Halt! Halt, you cowards! The susceptibilities of all Mystics reside in both their throat and lungs! Without respiration, your Ripple powers would be rendered useless.I speak the Wise Words of Wham to all challengers."Challenge me when you're stalwart in spirit and sound in strength." The second time you do, I will respect the strength that you've worked to obtain, and honor your dedication with decapitation.The whelp is without other Mystic companions.Then let us be off.Over here, bozos.I'm a Mystic you've overlooked.Only your eyelid's been nicked bad.Your eyeball's all right, Eyetie.That was breathtaking all right.Your technique got b*at, so have yourself a seat.I'll whack these wackos for you.Jojo! It's about time I unveil my very own incredible, indisputable, inscrutable Ripple technique.Your what?! I suppose an introduction's due.The name's Joseph Joestar, the man who busted one of your own boys into a bust.I call these my Ripple Bolas.First, I'll start by channeling Ripple energy into 'em.Oh no! Jojo, are you daft?! Why would you horse around now, of all times?! Get a clue, culo! I'm trying to avenge my friend here! So am I, Eyetie.I'm pretty tiffed about your friend's death, too.I'm fuming, in fact.But it's the arrogance of these arseholes that really takes the cake! I want you blokes to watch real carefully! Be mystified by my Ripple Bolas! I hate to admit it, but my Ripple powers do lack potency! But all I have to do is channel Ripple energy through these big bolas here! This combination makes up for my lack of potency! Ingenious, if I do say so myself! Give it a whirl! Let's leave.Disappointing.Compared to the men of yore, the present race of Man must've undergone devolution.Devolution, Master? Indeed.Jojo, are you even trying?! Tossing a pair of steel balls won't do much! Jojo might actually be making an earnest effort to duel them! But this tactic would only work on the ogres of Ogre Street! Jojo's nothing more than a sideshow attraction to the Pillar Men! He's entertaining them with his antics! Goddammit! Belittle me, will you?! Don't walk away, Wack! I'll bash you from behind! I advise against it.The lifespan of a human is short enough already.Enjoy what time you have left on this Earth.You don't say! I ate some squid ink spaghetti that looked pretty unappetizing, but it turned out to be very flavorful! Your opinion only matters after you've had a taste of my Ripple Bolas! His bolas have disappeared! I've been working on the railroad All the live-long day! Th-Those are So, do you get it yet? I'll bet you haven't.Then I suppose I'll just have to show you! How could he strike so impossible a pose?! He's swerving faster than Santana ever did! And Jojo tossed away his bolas before he could even hit him! I'll commend you for your whimsical use of weaponry.You've caught my intrigue.I shall award you one minute.One whole minute.That's all the time you'll have to duel me.Jojo! I've severed the veins in your wrist! You'll have to repair your blood vessels soon, but you need to decide how best to spend your minute, or else you will die from desanguination.The fight for your life has begun! I shall share the Wise Words of Wham once more."Time is of the essence And your essence is our timer." We shall await above, Wham.Whelp, go and retrieve your steel balls.What's that? Did I hear you right? "Retrieve my balls?" "Retrieve my bloody balls?!" Quite the contrary.My balls require no retrieval, whatsoever.I call it my Bolas Boomerang! The fight for your life will be over in a minute! Allow me to honor the absurdity of your arrogance towards mankind with a good bludgeoning! I'll channel Ripple energy into your body afterwards! Very well.Strike at me more.Know that you have the honor of being the first human to ever foul my face.An honor that I grant unto you, before your inevitable death! No human's ever mucked up your mug before?! Time to change that! Your arrogance brought upon my anger from your ignorance of poor Mark's demise! I think it's time you learned something called "humility!" Something's wrong! I don't think his arm's welling up from the pain! Wh-What'cha got going on there, Wham? You were wise to be hesitant in your advance.I've allowed for your barrage to serve as discipline, as a warning against future negligence.But the duration for discipline has now elapsed.Jojo, channel the Ripple into him already! Savor my Sacred Sandstorm! C-Cor blimey! Wham dislocates his left arm and revolves it clockwise, and also dislocates his right arm, revolving it counterclockwise! Jojo's jocular genius was jarred into jam after witnessing the incredible rotary force of Wham's giant fists! The destructive force of Wham's revolving fists created a violent vortex in between, manifesting what appeared to be a sphere of sandstorms! H-He's contorting this massive marble pillar like a wet rag being wrung! His powers are nothing short of supernatural! Jojo! Thus, is my Sacred Sandstorm.J-Jojo! S-Stay here! You need to split, Signor Speedwagon.I'll do what I can to keep him here! The blood of my brow obstructed my accuracy, but he did not escape to the posterior of the pillar without being severely wounded.He has perished.Although I needn't bother with these infants, the very fact that they witnessed my bludgeoning necessitates their deaths.Make your peace.Hallucinatus.I-Is he trying to! The audacity of him! He's trying to escape! How could he resort to playing dead?! Myself aside, how dare he leave Signor Speedwagon to this thing's mercy?! That scumbag! That wack really packs a whammy of a wallop! My respiration's a mess now, so the Ripple's of no use to me! I've only got my backup plan left I have to get away! Behold the depressing state of our gallant protagonist.He's crawling to safety while playing dead! He's even abandoned his Great-Uncle Speedwagon! Nevertheless, the grit of our gallant protagonist is not at all lost! Watch! So you did survive! You coward! Did you think that you would elude the wisdom of Wham?! I only needed to lead your wisdom astray and into this mine trolley with me.I was home free the moment I got in here! So you feigned cowardice in order to lure me into this contraption, allowing the other two to escape? You fell for another one of my schemes.Get outta here while you still can, Great-Uncle! Caesar, that includes you too! Jojo You ingenious jerk! I got them covered, but what about my own butt?! I gotta scheme up something, and fast! Good grief! His gallantry knows no end! The only way the grit of Jojo's gallantry could ever be lost is if he surrendered in the midst of battle! Jojo!!! Dammit! How could he do that when his body's so m*nled?! Jojo acted the fool, through and through, but I suppose he's dying to end this w*r as much as I am! The w*r that will only end with the death of those damn Pillar Men! You dare to quip provocations with so smug a smile, while your body remains battered so.Mighty Man You move me with your minuscule mettle! How can you maintain such mettle? Have you been taken by insanity? Or perhaps you have another scheme you would dare use against me? Would you like to know? It wouldn't involve allowing that puny stick that you snuck out from the catacombs to explode, would it? How the Hell did he know?! Or, would it involve forcing this contraption to cease, causing us both to be catapulted from it? In this manner! H-He saw through my scheme again! Your one minute of continuous blood loss shall expire soon.You are incapable of repairing your blood vessels now.You are doomed to death by desanguination.But why does your smile remain so smug, without any scheme to save you? Would you like to know why? Would you really like to know why? No, I needn't know the reason.I shall k*ll you now! Shame, because if I had a month, my Ripple powers could've become potent enough to overpower you.Overpower me? Overpower you, and in one month, to boot.Am I not the first human to have fouled your face? If I actually tried a bit, I could overpower you in no time.You know, just forget everything I said.Put me outta my misery already.I consider it a great honor to be k*lled by so seasoned a warrior.Continue our conversation.I'm so sore, I'm slurring me speech now, y'great sod.Whack me and be done with it, Wham.I demand that you continue our conversation! Jojo's still alive! Here's the thing You'll get to live with the fact that you let a filthy human bash your brow in with his balls, forever.To free yourself from that shame, you'll need to duel me again when I'm fully prepared, and k*ll me in combat.Again?! What makes you think that you're worth it, Jojo?! His pride just needs another push! He called me a coward when I made my escape! Cowardice is the bane of all proud warriors who uphold their honor in battle! He has to be a proud warrior! I have the talent, but I'm not a Master Mystic.With a month of formal training and tenacity, I could easily overpower you with my Ripple powers! Also, am I not the first human, an immature Mystic, in all of history, to have burrowed five-centimeters of steel deep into your brow?! But honestly, why take the risk? k*ll me, before my aptitude and talent peaks! You scoundrel! Wham.Master ACDC His one minute has already elapsed.Why do you not end his existence? Crikey! It's his buddy! Master ACDC, this immature Mystic has thoroughly captured my intrigue.Y-Yippee! Jojo, I shall acquiesce to your proposition.If you require one month's time of training, then you shall also have one month left to live! You won't whack me? I will not.You'll duel me again? I will.I don't think you should.If you don't k*ll me now, you're really gonna regret it.I've played on his pride! I'm safe now! I won't regret it, because I'm going to ensure that you don't escape, or renege on your word to a warrior.You always did enjoy binding them to their word, Wham.I call this the "Wedding Band of Wham." I shall bind this around the aortic arch of your heart.Wh-What are you doing to me?! In 33 days, the band will dissolve, releasing a potent poison from within.It cannot be removed through surgical means! If you make any attempt to remove it, the band shall break and release the poison! Your only salvation from certain death is to duel and defeat me within 33 days! Only then may you drink the antidote that resides in this ring! Jojo! With the Wedding Band of Wham, death will do us part.Jojo, on the 33rd night, I shall await your arrival in the Colosseum.You were foolish to believe that we'd allow an unconditional escape.I have no current quarrel with you, but take the "Engagement Ring of ACDC!" I've tacked it around your trachea! My poor heart and throat! This poison is unlike that of Wham's.You'll need the antidote in this ring.Cars, won't you bind him as well? Bind, I will not.Our time is eternal, but the time of our foes flow, leaving us without adversaries.Having an adversary will make this eternity worth living.But I empathize with your desire to torment the human.Do remember that our primary prerogative of attaining the powers of the Red Stone of Aja remains.We fly! Jojo, may your month of training bear fruit potent enough to defeat my Sacred Sandstorm! Wh-What have they done?! I got two wedding bands! It's a sick, twisted joke that they both belong to men! I'm engaged to two men, too! Don't they know that bigamy's a bloody crime, where I'm from?! g*dd*mn them! This doesn't matter, so long as Great-Uncle and Caesar are both safe.I can brood over this double-betrothal later Jojo You jerk He's fainted from massive blood loss but he pulled off the biggest bluff with pizazz and panache in the middle of battle! I'll assist in your Ripple regimen.We'll both have to improve our powers, if we hope to survive.In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky they Stand there Twenty four before my love and I'll be There Next Time I was blowing smoke up their arses when I said I'd be ready in a month! You'll understand after you've taken the tumble down this tower.Maestra, you wouldn't! I ain't going easy on no woman! Welcome to Venice! Episode Lisa Lisa the Ripple Master
01x16 - Lisa Lisa, Hamon CoachQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:51The wedding rings embedded around Jojo's heart and throat cannot be removed through surgical means.They will dissolve and release poison into Jojo's body in 33 days, unless he can obtain the antidotes by defeating both ACDC and Wham.Venice What the Hell have I done?! I was blowing smoke up their arses when I said I'd be ready in a month! And they bought my bluff! I should've said "one year" instead! Hey Jojo How can you even joke about this?! Help me help you and think of something already! I-I am thinking! But there's no use crying over spilt milk.We both need to keep calm in order to carry on, Caesar.For starters, you'll need to be able to perform the exact same act I'm about to show you.The water's not pouring out! Give it a try.Keep the water from pouring out.That shouldn't be too hard! Let's face some facts.In terms of our Ripple powers, we're almost equal in strength, but you always purge all of your powers out of your palms! That lack of control caused the water to explode.But I channeled my powers into my fingertips, those single points of contact.Those single concentrated points! Focus your energy into these single points, and you'll cause the water to oscillate within the glass, effectively trapping the liquid within.But increase your contact area, and your excess Ripple energy causes the water to explode.The smaller the nozzle of a liquid g*n, the further the liquid flies.Understand, Idiota?! In order for you to better control your Ripple powers, you need to undergo the formal Ripple Regimen.I've brought you to Venice for this very reason, because my Ripple Master resides here! Oh no! I hate breaking my back over work, that above all else, warrants effort! 31 Days until Marital Dissolution 31 Days until Marital Dissolution Once, four folks from the fires of Hell Shijima no soko kara awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe Shinku no chishio ga Their ambition for power assembled the blood of a few bombastic braves.tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger! Yaiba surinuke yatsura no suki wo tsuke He would exploit the flaws of the foes he faced! Tsuranuita omoi ga mirai wo hiraku And his memory would live on for all posterity! He's like a bloody stream! Atsuku like a bloody stream He's blazing like a bloody stream But would he be free of the cursed fate of his family? ketsumyaku ni kizamareta innen ni Who can say, but the bonds of these braves Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna nigirishimete will never be buried.Lisa Lisa the Ripple Master Episode Hey Caesar, ain't Venice more of a touristy-type of town? What would a Ripple Master be doing here? Gondolier.We need a ride.Take us to isola di aria serbatoio.Gondolier, did you not hear me?! H-He's standing on his bloody oar over water! Wh-Who the Hell is this guy?! Crikey! Hey, Arsehole! What in the Hell did I do to deserve a decking?! Now you're cruising for a bruising! My, at least you're capable of using Ripple energy to stand on water.A woman?! M-Maestra! This woman is known as Lisa Lisa.Her real name, personal history, family, and the motivation behind her mastery of the Art of Mystics remain a mystery.Nevertheless, Lisa Lisa will devote the next month to training Jojo and myself! You still ain't off the hook for hitting me head! I'm not gonna pull any punches, even if you are a woman! I've seen your spectacular talents for myself with this oar.You even have my compliments for managing your waddle over water.However, if you expect to become a respectable Ripple user within a month, you'll have to dispose yourself to death! Th-The water's hardened into a pair of pillars! What is this?! Joseph Joestar.For the next month, you'll have to wear that Ripple Respirator for your Ripple Regimen all day, every day.I-I can't br-! Find your respiratory rhythm.Once you have your rhythm, you'll have no issue respiring through the Ripple Respirator.But if you lose it, the respirator's valves will close, and you will suffer from suffocation.You need to be capable of running 100 kilometers while wearing that respirator! B-Bollocks! Get this bloody thing off-! I-I can't breathe! The Ripple Regimen has already begun.The only relief you'll receive is during meals and when brushing your teeth.Jojo, find your rhythm.You won't have any problems breathing once you do.Wh-Why I oughta bust you up good, you bitch! There's another important thing that need be noted.I'm not teaching you the Art of Mystics to save you from death, I'm teaching you because I need people capable of k*lling the Pillar Men! Y-You g*dd*mn, selfish You want Maestra to mess you up some more? I don't hit women! Formally, I would like to welcome you both to Venice! She's earned the title of Ripple Master, but I would never wed a mistress like her.But there's a cute quality about her Show some respect.Funny you should say that, Casanova.Why are you so respectful towards that broad? I respect the Maestra as much as I do my own mother! Don't demean her, or I will deck you.Isola di aria serbatoio is a small island located 30 minutes north of Venice.Unlike the vibrant views of Venice, this island remains shrouded thick in mystique.However, that very mystique is equally befitting of its very mysterious owner, Lisa Lisa.This island will serve as our training ground! That entire island is my very own villa.She told me to be disposed to death, but how bad could it actually be? Splendid.Both you and Joseph are safe and sound.I couldn't ask for more.Great-Uncle, don't you dare tell Nanna Erina about those rings! You blab, and I'll turn you black n' blue! I can't tell her Where would I even begin? The preliminary trial to the Ripple Regimen begins with the "Pillar of Hell!" A-Are you serious?! What's she screaming about? M-Maestra, you would damn us to so daunting a trial already?! Even I haven't attempted it before! Not the trial that has claimed the lives of many trainees! You either complete this trial, or you take a boat back to the mainland.Why don't you two fill me in on what's what, eh?! What the bloody Hell is this "Pillar of Hell?!" You'll understand after you've taken a tumble down this tower.Maestra, you wouldn't! Th-This is oil! The whole damn pillar's drenched in oil! The objective of this trial is to climb up 24 meters to the top of this tower, barehanded.The only way out is up.You must complete this trial, or you will die trying.We gotta reach the top of this slippery pillar?! 30 Days until Marital Dissolution Are you outta your mind?! A trial designed to temper and test the tenacity of Ripple users! This trial is so infamously, yet so aptly named the "Pillar of Hell!" This is trying I'm using all of my Ripple energy just to stick to this pillar.Even moving my fingers a centimeter upwards is exhausting! If I fall If I fall from this pillar even once I don't think I'd have enough stamina to try the climb again! We're dead if we stay still! We're have to climb up! Jojo! The longer you keep jumping, the sooner you'll be drained of your stamina! Climb up the pillar-! D-Dammit! I can't spare a breath, either! My Ripple Respiration went awry from just speaking! This whole trial is bollocks! You knew fully that I lacked the power and control needed to climb this prick of a pillar! That g*dd*mn broad threw our arses down here without a second thought! She just lost what respect I had left for her! I've never wanted to pay back a woman before, but I got plenty of ideas to toss around me head before I reach the top! Plenty! So, a bunch of trainees d*ed before they could make it to the top, eh? I'll bet they all d*ed from stupidity! You will honor the sanctity of the trial, and abide by the following rules! You may rely only on your Ripple energy and your bare hands to reach the top! All other methods are prohibited! Gimme a break, Lisa Lisa! I mean, Mistress! Y-You don't mean to leave me here to die, do you? This is my first day of training after all! You're just trying to see if I actually make an honest attempt, right? You'll lower a ladder later, right? There was no pity in her eyes.She really will leave me in this pit to die! Goddammit! I don't care if you're a Ripple Master! That beauty of yours ain't gonna save you from my impending wrath! 28 hours have elapsed! Caesar is at the 15 meter mark, whereas Jojo remains at the very bottom.The rings will dissolve in 28 days! 28 Days until Marital Dissolution It's been a little more than a day already, but Caesar's only made it about halfway! I really should be concerned about me own arse.Even he's desperate to save his own.Caesar's fingers are the only things keeping him stuck to the pillar, b-but it looks like they just might slip! His Ripple energy's nearly spent! Climb Caesar, climb! O-Oh no, he's slipping again! He's barely hanging on by his fingertips! Caesar! W-Wait a moment, I think I just had an epiphany! Caesar's not in any danger of slipping at all! He's not using his fingertips to prevent slippage! The smaller the nozzle of a liquid g*n, the further the liquid flies.I-I think I get it now! I've solved the riddle to controlling the Ripple! Stick! Finally, I've used the Ripple to stick to the pillar! I thought that using both hands would add more friction and support my body better! It's bizarre, but I was actually thinking backwards! If I concentrate my Ripple energy into each of my fingers, adhesion to the points of contact increases! How did I not realize this sooner?! But now that I know, I'm gonna climb this pillar here, and pay back that busty bitch in full! Jojo's finally found his rhythm! Since then, 24 more hours have elapsed! Caesar is situated at the 18 meter mark, with Jojo behind him at the 16 meter mark! 27 Days until Marital Dissolution The rings will dissolve in 27 days! I know why Caesar's been taking his sweet time to climb beyond the 18 meter mark! Past the middle mark, this whacky pillar warps upward! Every movement needs to be carefully calculated beyond here! The warped curvature of this pillar reminds me of its twisted owner! Three more hours have elapsed! Caesar has reached the 19 meter mark, with Jojo only a meter behind him! Well, what do we have here? I-I-It's a fissure! With just a smidge of space for my fingers to fit! Boy oh boy, I can have a breather! Whoopie! F-Finally! I'm chuffed to bits for a breath! Wh-What was that?! Did I press something?! Wh-What's going on?! Could this be You may rely only on your Ripple energy and your bare hands to reach the top! Stay sharp! Something's gonna sh**t out! That smidge of space was a booby trap! We're barely sticking to this pillar as it is b-but how are we supposed to get past this now?! At the 20 meter mark of the 24-meter-tall pillar, an umbrella of oil spews forth! The razor-sharp nature of this ultrahigh-pressure oil barrier makes it impossible to pass! Wh-What's the matter, Caesar? A-Are you angry with me?! S-Sorry about the cock up, Caesar.But who could've resisted reaching out for a chance to rest?! I'll bet the architect was one twisted twat for putting that trap! Played me like a fool! Jojo was compelled to reach for that fissure due to a lack of confidence But am I confident enough in my own powers, that I can overcome this trap?! Only one way to find out! Wh-What the-?! He's standing perpendicular to the pillar! Caesar! Observe my Ripples of Adhesion and Repulsion! I'm channeling adhesive Ripple energy into my feet, while channeling repulsive Ripple energy throughout my body for protection from the barrier! I can coordinate, control, and simultaneously channel opposing Ripple energies! I made it! But controlling opposing Ripple energies will be an impossible feat for Jojo to replicate! He won't break through the barrier! H-Hot damn! I'm glad Caesar made it through! But I'm not even sure if I could rival his refined technique! After nine more grueling hours Caesar Passes Trial in 61 Hours Caesar has finally reached the top of the pillar in 61 hours.M-Maestra! Jojo won't be able to hold on any longer! Please halt the oil barrier's flow! He's impulsive by nature, and when he's at his wit's end, he'll be driven by impulse to penetrate the oil barrier! A-And if he does Sticking to this one spot ain't gonna stop that oil from spewing! If he attempts to penetrate it he'll be bisected from being blasted by ultrahigh-pressurized oil! And even if he manages to repel the barrier's wave, he'll fall to the bottom and die! Maestra! That's it! It's all or nothing now! Time to fly! Don't do it, Jojo! Stay where you are! I got the rhythm of the b*at, and the Ripple in my feet! Jojo!!! Wait a minute He's using Ripple energy to repel the barrier's trough to ride the wave! The further the wave pushes me out, the weaker its pressure becomes! Time to jump! He used the remaining momentum of the barrier's wave to reach that wall! He didn't fall, and he even gained three meters from that jump! None have ever attempted to overcome the trial by riding the wave.He's rather clever for using the trap to compensate for his lack of control and technique.I-I made it! But g*dd*mn! Since this wall is located above the warped pillar's 20 meter mark, I doubt anyone ever made it here! My exhaustion's wearing on me I had less than an arms-length left, too! M-My rhythm's gone and my respiration's a mess! C-Caesar! Don't get the wrong idea! I wasn't angry at you for triggering that trap! Maestra, please forgive me for lending him a hand! Lend away, Caesar but aren't you as equally exhausted as he? I completely forgot! Caesar, I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart! Don't let me go! After ten seconds and 13 consecutive pleas for Caesar's assistance, Jojo reached the top of the pillar.Jojo Passes Trial in 61 Hours and 9 Minutes Hold your horses, Mistress Lisa Lisa.When I was stuck to that damn pillar, I thought up a few decent ways to pay you back.But I've narrowed it down to two! Should I strip your clothes off, or should I pinch your nose until you cry?! I thought he was simpleton, but I suppose even he can bear a significant grudge.Pick your poison! I-I did it! I can control and keep the water from spilling out of this glass! Magnifico! After these three trying days, he's finally got the gist of controlling the Ripple! His talent is impressive, but even more impressive is the Maestra's ability draw out that talent! Mistress! I-I'm chuffed to bits! I-I'd like to start the next trial, please! I'll overcome anything you throw at me! You're hard to figure.Maybe you are just a simpleton.Fret not, for I have plenty of things to throw at you.I guarantee that you'll be chuffed to death.Ma'am! Prepare yourself, because the learning curve increases over the next three weeks.What are you blokes sneaking up behind me for?! Wh-Who are they?! The water's been gelatinized! Loggins and Messina are both my servants, but they'll be your drill instructors.E-Even I can't gelatinize water! Would you like to learn how? Would you like to perform this technique as I? O-Of course! I'm obligated to learn your techniques! Obligated? Then you're also obligated to have a closer look.Why don't you two boys introduce yourselves? It'll be especially helpful to know the names of the boy's we'll be drilling the next three weeks.Respiration! Temper your respiration, and your body, strength, and power will naturally follow.You need to respire at least ten times within the span of a second! I-I'm dying here! I want you to inhale for ten minutes, and exhale for ten minutes, in that order! You get to remove the respirator afterwards! Wh-What have I gotten myself into?! 7 Days until Marital Dissolution The rings will dissolve in seven days! Next Time I have one final trial for you both.Our strength remains insufficient.He's got a heart of gold.This is batty! Bizarre, even! How could you?! Episode Entrapment Ahoy!
01x17 - The Deeper PlanQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:52Entrapment Ahoy Episode 17 The spines of the Stone Mask may pierce through the skulls of men, but it lacks the strength to even penetrate our eternal flesh.It necessitates a greater source of strength.That's toasty This is the Red Stone of Aja, the rarest and most beautiful of all gemstones of the natural world.Light entering this gemstone will be refracted over one-billion times within, which amplifies the intensity of light, allowing a single concentrated beam to exit through its angle of entry.A prodigious power of the natural world.But it lacks potency! The strength of this imperfect cut cannot empower the spines to pierce our skulls! Only the perfect cut, the Ultimate Aja, may be embedded into the Stone Mask, granting the spines sufficient strength! And once we adorn the True Stone Mask, we will overcome the Sun, we shall reach the final stage of our evolution as True Omnipotent Organisms! The creator of the Stone Mask was fabled to be Cars, the most intelligent of all Pillar Men.Long ago, he crossed the Atlantic together with ACDC and Wham, in search of the Ultimate Aja.Suzie Q.Here is your gem, Mistress Lisa Lisa.Good girl.This is the perfect cut, the marvel of the natural world, the Ultimate Aja.So you had that stupid ruby the whole time?! The Mystics of two millenia past were eradicated by the Pillar Men, but successfully concealed this gem from them.I shall continue their cause, and conceal this stone as they had.Caesar, I know what you're going through.The terrors and tragedies our grandfathers and others faced because of the Stone Mask All because of Cars's accursed creation! Smash it! Smash that stone to smithereens! It's about time we torment them by breaking their precious jewel! That, I cannot do.Why not?! It is said that "without the Ultimate Aja, they cannot be defeated." You're yankin' me leg here! I wish I were.Nevertheless, I will defend this gemstone to the death.Jojo, Caesar I have one final trial for you both.A-A final trial?! Caesar will be paired with Messina, and Jojo to Loggins.Duel and defeat them.Entrapment Ahoy! Episode Are you ready, Caesar? Ready and willing! Dawn will be breaking soon and the darkest hour is always before the dawn.But where, oh where, could dear Loggins be? You're a real force to be reckoned with, but I'm ready to pay you back for those three rotten weeks! Is that Loggins? I-I don't believe it! I-I can't believe it! Loggins is d-dead?! A-ACDC?! The only reason you'd ever be on this isle is if you knew It was the next isle over.She who bears of the Ultimate Aja resides on the main isle.His lungs have been pulverized.One of two susceptibilities all Ripple users share.And all it took was a single lunge to his lungs Here lies the body of Drill Instructor Loggins.For the past three weeks, this twat tormented my entirety through the Ripple Regimen.I wanted so badly to pay you back for my suffering but now, you can just watch from above as I avenge you with your teachings! Hold it, ACDC.I had six days remaining, but I've had a change of heart.I'm gonna rob you of your nose ring now! Make way.I have no time to waste on you.Bollocks! You've got plenty of time to waste! Sharp sight.Your gaze could cut through me, even.But the last time I encountered one with oculars as sharp as yours, he met a dull end.I'll spare you one last breath.Make way! Make contact with me, and I'll bite off more than you ever wanted chewed! Make me! My Make me make way! I only ever make way for me morning bowel movement! He's managed to penetrate my flesh with perpetual Ripple energy And it only took him three weeks to learn some control Unfortunate.Your small growth spurt in the Art of Mystics surprised me.However, you were never going to be ready to face me! I grew tired of devouring multitudes of you arrogant Mystics two millenia ago! I will rend your arm asunder! Once I do, you will never channel another Ripple through it! Bend! Didn't see it before, did you? I wrapped a thread of silk around your arm! I had it soaked in canola oil to increase Ripple conductivity! I wish I could've strung you up by your neck, but beggars can't be choosers! Where did this thread come from?! F-From the corpse! I admit, it's a despicable scheme cooked up in poor taste, but I consider it a joint effort between Loggins and I, ACDC! 2,500 years ago, there was a m*llitary treatise in China, known as The Art of w*r.One proverb proceeds "Every battle is won before it is ever fought." Meaning, that victory is assured to the side whose schemes go unnoticed before the battle is ever fought! I was a tried truant when it came to school, but Nanna Erina taught me tons about history, so I consider it my forte.You've lived longer than me, but that doesn't mean you've learned to scheme like me! Twirl! C-Curse you! What, are you angry? Angry that you allowed your amputated arm to evaporate? Well that's just too bad! I'm more ticked than you are! Because of your bloody ring, I haven't had a good night's sleep these past three weeks! How could you?! My precious arm has perished! What's wrong with him?! H-He's bawling! I thought he'd be pissed from the pulsing pain, but this arsehole's just full of surprises! I-It's pretty disturbing to watch him wail about like a baby! My poor arm! H-He's giving me the creeps, more than anything else! I'd better lop his head off now! That was a good weeping.You see, I have an unhinged disposition.Whenever my anger peaks its threshold, only crying will soothe the agitation.So you are familiar with The Art of w*r As am I.Long ago, I crossed over into the realm of Sinae."w*r is the art of deception." "All warfare is based on deception." "If your foe is of a choleric disposition, anger them, and expose his every weakness." Your attempt to exploit my anger is admirable, but I cannot be angered.Nevertheless, Jojo, your growth has left me awe-stricken.Your control over the Ripple has earned my admiration.Long have I been without a worthy foe to fell.H-How could you desecrate his corpse?! It's slightly slim, but with time, it shall reform into my own arm.H-He's hard to figure! His anger, actions, and emotions are all haphazard! Unnerved by my actions? Has my cruelty left you concerned? I-I don't know! I've been able to act upon the emotions and slips of every enemy I've faced, but I just can't put a finger on this twat's thoughts! It's like he's reading my mind, instead! Loggins's corpse is B-Blazing! H-His corpse has spontaneously combusted! But how?! When animals expend energy for any task, their endothermic temperature rises to an extent, but I can raise the endothermic temperature of my own blood to 500ÂÂ°C.And when I severed this arm, I injected my blood into that body, which caused it to combust.Wham is known as "Whirlwind Wham" for his mastery of wind, but I am known as "Infernal ACDC" for my mastery of flame! When you induced his corpse to spontaneously combust on contact, I'll admit you had me concerned, but the fact that you deliberately did that to unnerve me is as plain as day! Clobber him, my Ripple Bolas! My Ripple powers have increased since our last encounter! You are concerned.Concerned for your safety and driven by desperation, you att*cked with so tactless a tool, Jojo.I'll s*ab your skull with my tendrils and turn your face into a fiery mess.Feast upon the Hellfire Tendrils of the Infernal ACDC! Jojo Here I come, Caesar! Bubble Barrier! That's enough, Caesar! We carry this on any longer, and we both will die.I hate to admit it, but I've lost this duel.I've been training here ten years longer than you have, but your Ripple barrier bereaved my forearm of its fuzz.Prolonging our duel would only serve to further my humiliation.Caesar, you've passed the final trial with flying colors.You'd observe the trial of that bumbling Brit, rather than celebrate your victory? My Ripple powers only developed to this extent because I wanted to overcome Jojo's own.From the day we survived our encounter with the Pillar Men, we were bound to each other.He may be prone to make reckless provocations, but he's got a heart of gold.You have little finesse with making any male friends, yet your attraction to him is alike a lass's.Th-That's ACDC! He's avoided my injections through flight I-It's a good thing this respirator blocked his tendrils Cor blimey, that burns! His blood's blazing hot! Arsehole! I haven't even breathed a real breath of air, and you've already seared my sexy lips! Me skin's singed, you shitter! Jojo Your provocation is nothing more than a diversion to allow you some seconds for scheming, no? Your face speaks the truth.My assumption is correct, is it not, Jojo?! With my next plan of att*ck I-I should stick with the Thread Shredder.While avoiding his onslaught, I'll bob and weave around a section of spikes and loop a thread around them.They'll have to stay inconspicuous and when he steps into this section, I'll trap him in the thread and finish him with the Ripple! D-Does he really have to snicker? C-Could he have already seen through my scheme?! No! There's no way he could know! Feast your eyes on my Hellfire Wheel! You will not escape the inferno of my Hellfire Tendrils for long! Finally, you've taken notice.Wouldn't you like to know why my cap's shrunk so? It's because you've entered my Thread Shredder! This cap is 100% made of wool, meaning it's highly conductive to Ripple energy.Wh-What's with the smirk?! Y-You won't be smirking for long! Your next phrase will be, "It's about time I wipe that stupid smirk off your face!" It's about time I wipe that stupid smirk off your face! H-He's got my gibe down! What shredder might you be speaking of, save for my own?! I've already seen through your shabby scheme! Jojo, do you recall your citation? "Every battle is won before it is ever fought." I'll have to agree with your every word! Down to the very last syllable! However, it was my Tendril Tactics that bested your Thread Shredder! I will now proceed to pierce your body with my tendrils, and inject my blazing-hot blood into every bit of your body! Your body will burn beautifully, and your flesh will flow alike the wax of a lit candle! Jojo's in trouble! H-He won't make it! Caesar! From what we can see, I could only surmise that Loggins has been k*lled.If Jojo is defeated, we will have to intercept ACDC afterwards.Reaching that isle will take too much time, and even then, it'll be too late.As heartless as this sounds, we must prioritize the defense of the Mistress and the Ultimate Aja! Now, we will make preparations for his interception! Jojo Jojo! As I sear your skin, sing for me a sorrowful symphony of your screams! As you stand entrapped by my tendrils, you still dare to snicker?! Has the fear of your impending death driven you insane?! Listen.I snicker at your stupidity because you haven't realized your defeat yet.Your defeat, which stems from that awfully long slumber of yours.Defeat?! What defeat?! Wait, you didn't know? I thought you could see through all my schemes.If you did, you'd understand the cause of your downfall.You only thought you had me with your Tendril Tactics, but you were deluding yourself! Give mankind two millenia, and we'll make progress in small steps.This'll sound trivial to you, but between the 18th and 19th Century, the heyday of illusionists and magicians came when stage magic became a form of entertainment.And I just happen to love the magic of illusions! I-I severed that thread H-How could it still be whole?! Behold the magic of the Restored Rope! I snuck another thread in secret, in case the original was severed, keeping the Thread Shredder solid! Even if the red thread is severed at will keep it whole.these points, the hidden white thread The oldest trick in the book! And now you'll say, "Before you channel any wretched Ripple energy, my tendrils will drill you full of holes!" Before you channel any wretched Ripple energy, my tendrils will drill you full of holes! Be ripped by the Ripple, and shred by my thread! How could I be humiliated so, by a mere man?! I am one of the Omnipotent Organisms! I can't be k*lled by this cur! I will have your head for exposing my own! Face my flames! I-I can see some sort of energy being released from his body! It must be the lifeforce he's accumulated over so many millenia! Begone! And may the lifeforce you've stolen from the multitudes of men be purged from your combusting body! Loggins I owe you a word of gratitude for your teachings.Grazie, Loggins! Santana survived our duel and remains paralyzed in stone but ACDC's body combusted and left not a trace.They should've made it one way, or the other.Maybe it's because my Ripple powers have amplified since then.To the victor goes the well-earned spoils of a small antidote.Why does this antidote look so much like snot? It had been on his bloody nose for God-knows-how-long Oh well, bottoms up.The antidote has done its duty.I just can't feel that ring around my trachea anymore.I should catch up with Lisa Lisa and Caesar on the main isle.I used a lot more brain than I did brawn against ACDC Maybe that's why my shoulder's so stiff.Six Days until Marital Dissolution of The Heart Six Days until Marital Dissolution of The Heart I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time I think white will do just fine.Hold it until after we've passed the border.But I think this pattern has its own merits.I'll k*ll them!

01x18 - Commander Stroheim's RevengeQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:53I used a lot more brain than I did brawn against ACDC Maybe that's why my shoulder's so stiff.It's wearing on me Episode The Stroheim Squad Strikes Back Dawn has broken Both Caesar and Jojo should be returning anytime now Mistress Lisa Lisa.Which blusa would you care to wear this morning? Suzie Q, you're such a dear.I think white's quite clean, but maybe you're feeling a little flashy today.Be a dear and choose one for me.Well, let's see I think white will do just fine, but I think this pattern has its own merits as well.I wonder if any issues arose during their trials I've been unusually on edge all night because of this broken wine glass.I think the pristine white will do the trick.Suzie Q.Yes? When Caesar and Jojo return, tell them to come to my chambers.It'll be my pleasure.But I really do love the pizazz of this pattern.Which should I pick? I'm at a loss! White! Wait a minute! It has to have pizazz! This is a real toughie! Let's have a go at the pizazz, Suzie Q.Pizazz it is! The blusa and towel are both on the table.I'll deal with the broken wine glass, so please leave it as is.Very well.Say, Suzie Q What'cha screaming for?! Shush up and stop shrieking already! Wh-Who are you?! I don't know you! Y-You're an intruder, aren't you?! What intruder? It's me, you silly lass.Joseph Joestar.Jojo?! Shut up! I didn't recognize you without your respirator! Seriously! I can't blame you.I've only been wearing it for the past three weeks! So what's the verdict? Molto bello, si? Your lips look weird.Sure it looks weird now, but if you make me your man, these lips will be doing you a lot of loving.Love you? No way! What's wrong? Oh, it was nothing.Just my imagination.And also, the Mistress would like to see you in her chambers, but she's bathing at the moment, so do wait for at least a half hour.I was on my way up anyway, but sure.I needed tell her that the Ultimate Aja's been bubbled.There are bubbles in the Mistress's gemstone? A-Actually, forget it.It's not anything that a non-Ripple user needs to know.O-Okay Oh, and Jojo? Toots? I find your face to be quite chiseled.That's odd.My shoulders aren't so strained and stiff anymore.6:00 AM - ACDC's Ring is Neutralized Six Days Remain until Marital Dissolution from Wham I wanted to tell Lisa Lisa about ACDC ASAP, but Suzie Q told me to hold off for 30 minutes, because she's bathing.Oh, I'll hold off my findings all right In fact, I'll hold them for next 30 minutes while waiting in front of her door, but would peeping through this keyhole here perhaps be too criminal? Bitchy! Suzie Q? She's inside already? When did she get in? Kinda quick I thought I saw her at the dock moments ago What's this? The doorknob's dripping with this mysterious mucosal matter.Say, Suzie Q have both Caesar and Jojo returned yet? Suzie Q? S-Suzie Q! My gemstone was on the table, but where is it now?! Who are you?! Where is the Ultimate Aja?! Wh-What's going on S-Something's possessing Suzie Q's body! You've rendered me into but a brain, but nevertheless, I will challenge you curs to one last duel! I sent a package containing the Ultimate Aja on a mailboat moments ago, but I will not allow you to pursue it! I will hold you here and keep you from pursuing it! This woman that I've possessed still has plenty of life in her, but you cannot free her from my control without k*lling us both! But can you fools find the courage to k*ll her? ACDC! Jojo! The tenacity of these things never cease to astound Jojo! You sure took your sweet time getting here, Caesar.Y-You're okay So you survived your encounter with ACDC? You're one lucky son of a g*n Jojo! What did you do to the Maestra?! Nothing, you nincompoop! It's not her I'm concerned about, but Suzie Q! Suzie Q? What's wrong with her? She's being possessed ACDC possessed her, a harmless non-Ripple user, with his bloody brain and tendrils! Salvami, Caesar Save me They're both bullying me right now, but you won't, will you? Remember, that's not really Suzie Q speaking, but ACDC who's using her voice.Caesar, the Ultimate Aja has been shipped via mailboat already! Leave ACDC to us, and go recover the Ultimate Aja from that boat.If that package ever leaves these Venetian shores via train, it could go international, making it almost impossible to track! You're not going anywhere! If you want to leave, you cazzi will have to go through this woman! A masculine tone He must be using his tendrils to control every part of her body! Come to me! Do it! k*ll me with the Ripple! Your combined Ripple powers can easily split me in two! However, I'm certain that this poor girl's heart won't be able to withstand that power! Can you really bring yourselves to k*ll her? If you coglioni can, then do the deed and be done with it already! Enough! You'd better think again, ACDC! I could k*ll her without any qualms if it meant saving the lives of millions.I'd just consider her casualty to be collateral damage.D-Don't joke around, Jojo! Ashes to ashes, ACDC! You wouldn't! Jojo! I'm really gonna bash your brain into hers! Goddammit, I can't do it! You arsehole! I thought you'd have enough sense to skedaddle on outta her body, but you didn't even budge! Enough of your pathetic provocations.You don't have the balls to k*ll her.By now, the mailboat has already reached the mainland of Venice.You're too late now! But fret not! Wh-What is he doing to her body? E-Enough, ACDC! I'm going to cause this woman's body to spontaneously combust, creating an acidic rain of my boiling blood to come showering down! I-It's his boiling blood! H-He's destroying Suzie Q's body from within! If he continues this rain, Suzie Q will die and we'll all sustain severe scalds! I-It pains me, but Jojo, you must channel the Ripple into her body! Goddammit Don't make me do it! I'm already living with the guilt of lopping off Major Stroheim's leg! Something There's gotta be something we can do to save her! Th-Then I'll do it.No Maestra! I-I'll do it! H-Hold it Caesar! I have an idea! Remember what you did to bypass that oil barrier?! L-Let's give that a whirl! It's better than k*lling Suzie Q outright! We gotta oppose each other to overpower him, understand? Oppose? I-I do understand.Y-You might be on to something.Catch my drift? Boys, do it now! Understood, Maestra.Jojo, I need you to match my respiration.Andiamo! Jojo is channeling the Ripple of Positive Repulsion throughout Suzie Q's body, whereas Caesar is channeling the Ripple of Negative Adhesion only into her heart! Positive A Equili- brium The negative force of adhesion stabilizes the heart, while the positive force repulses ACDC! Negative Ripple Energy Positive Positive Ripple Energy Positive Negative Ripple Energy Positive Ripple Energy Positive Positive Negative Ripple Energy Positive Ripple Energy Positive Positive Negative Ripple Energy Positive Positive Ripple Energy Positive Couldn't withstand the repulsion, could he? Jojo! Just let him be, Caesar.The sunlight will negate his existence.He made me sick to my stomach! Only the most cowardly of creatures would use a woman as their cover! I'd call that courageous, Caesar.I'm almost certain of it now, after dueling him.He would've done anything he could to attain the Ultimate Aja, for the sake of his brethren.I don't know how many thousands of years he had lived, but I do know that he spent his whole life devoted to finding that single stone.He stooped to doing some despicable deeds, but I respect his devotion, if nothing else.Jojo Suzie Q.While you were possessed by ACDC, a part of your consciousness was not entirely subdued, so answer me.Where did he send the Ultimate Aja? St.Moritz Switzerland A small parcel It was stamped with the Mistress's personal seal The address on the paper was Switzerland?! So Cars and Wham are in Switzerland?! Yes, and I confirmed that the freight train bound for Switzerland departed the station ten minutes ago.So the Ultimate Aja is aboard that train, France Italy Venice Germany St.Moritz Switzerland meaning that we have to b*at that train to St.Moritz first! We'll have to resort to some despicable deeds of our own, in order to keep the Ultimate Aja from their grasps.Our conduct may be considered criminal, and another one of us may be sacrificed in the process.And it ain't gonna be me.After undergoing the Ripple Regimen, I have the utmost confidence in my own skills.I'll m*rder those mooks.Caesar! Arrivederci it is! Say Suzie Q, swerve around for a second! So long, Suzie Q! Someday, I'm gonna come back to Venice, y'hear? You will? Sure! But until then, you'd better get some good R&R! See ya! Jojo, you'd better come back to visit me! Alrl ight already! But who knows, I might just come back when you're an old nan! You're a jerk, Joestar! I'll be back soon, Toots.St.Moritz, Switzerland Drive better, Dummkopf! What's wrong with your arms? Mein Gott! The steering wheel's slashed! ACDC hasn't called in yet He went to ascertain the whereabouts of the Ultimate Aja in Venice but something must have happened to him.Jojo.Jojo! Wake up, Jojo! 5:00 PM - Six Days Remain until Marital Dissolution from Wham Wh-What is it? We've finally caught up to the train! They're busy declaring their cargo at the station.Beyond this border, the drive to St.Moritz takes less than an hour.We're lucky that we caught them here.We need you awake, Jojo.Listen, I'm trying to conserve my stamina here.Stamina's vital, okay? If you want action, then we'd better jump that train and take the parcel now.Then, I can start concentrating on my inevitable duel with Wham.We jump the train after it crosses the border.What in the blazes Pipe down, you prick! If you need to pass us, then pass us already! They're Jerries! What are they doing here on the Swiss-Italian border?! You sound quite spirited, and your growth matches that very spirit, Herr Joestar.Wh-What was that?! What did you say?! H-Hold it! Who the Hell're you?! I don't know any of you Third Reich Jerries! Look around the train! It's surrounded by the SS! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, we have the parcel! That parcel has my seal stamped on it! Then inside that package is The Ultimate Aja! Why would the SS know about the Ultimate Aja?! The Third Reich will require this Red Stone of Aja for experimental purposes.You see, you've been under our surveillance ever since your arrival in Venice.No, ever since the extermination of the SS stationed in Rome.We know about the Ripple Regimen, your encounter with ACDC, and your pursuit of this very stone.We are stationed at a lodge nearby.Accompany us there.We have much to learn from you about the Ultimate Aja, and the two who remain.Help us help you, as we are well-acquainted, are we not, Jojo? Hey, Arsehole! I ain't acquainted with no Jerry! Don't you dare be using my nickname now! I didn't expect the Third Reich to show up.M-Maestra! We have to follow them.As long as it's out of Cars's hands, it's in good hands.Italy Austria The Third Reich began Hungary Germany France England Vienne Romania Switzerland Paris Berlin Prague Czechoslovakia Warsaw Poland its occupation of several European territories circa 1938, 1938.3.13 Annexation of Austria 1939.3.15 Occupation of Bohemia and Moravia driven by the niggling fear of losing their influence 1939.9.28 Joint German-Soviet Partition of Poland Determined and political standing in the world.But after learning of the purported power of the True Stone Mask, that fear was put to rest.The Third Reich's ambition for global domination would surely be assured through the eternal powers granted by the True Stone Mask.Same Day Five Hours Later 10:00 PM I've discerned each and every intrinsic temperature within this room.A fire is lit in the hearth.There are four light sources on the walls, two on the ceiling, and two, no, three on a desk.There are four humans standing proximate to this wall.From the right, their statures read: 178 cm, 174 cm, 181 cm, and 178 cm, with one human near the hearth, measuring 183 cm.Five males en masse! One, two four, and five.You must be Cars.Swift was your journey to Venice, only to learn of your fellow's demise.And swift was your return to St.Moritz, upon learning of our procurement of the Ultimate Aja.So swift to steal it, are you? So swift, that you necessitated an ingenious method of silencing my men, without so much as a single moan from them.I sensed only five men within this room but why couldn't I sense your temperature as well?! Say, Jerries! Where's our polenta?! We're starving up here! Cars?! His hand is metallic?! You're Stroheim?!

"Bizarre" can't even begin to describe the strangeness of this scene! Cars and Stroheim, who was blasted to smithereens back in Mexico, are standing before my very eyes! Shijima no soko kara Once, four folks arose from the fires of Hell and awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe Their ambition for power assembled Shinku no chishio ga tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru the blood of a few bombastic braves.Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger! Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite Yaiba surinuke yatsura no suki wo tsuke He would exploit the flaws of the foes he faced! Tsuranuita omoi ga mirai wo hiraku And his memory would live on for all posterity! He's like a bloody storm! Atsuku like a bloody stone Red-hot like a bloody stone, ketsumyaku ni kizamareta innen ni but would he be ever free of the cursed fate of his family? Who can say, but the bonds of these braves Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna will never be buried.nigirishimete Episode 19 Climbing the Cliff of Calamity Cars and Stroheim! He's got a metallic hand and a strange steel sash wrapped over his socket.I knew the Jerries made some mad machinery from their advancements in Medicine and Science with the sole intention to be used in w*r! It's that very machinery that saved you, isn't it, Stroheim?! Jojo, I've returned from the very depths of Hell.I-I suppose I'm scot-free from guilt As a fellow human, I don't despise the guy or nothing, but he can be an arsehole because of his SS affiliations.His oh-so-high pride especially makes him a real pompous prick, but I'm sorta I'm glad to see him back.Sit on that sofa there and observe my battle, ja? H-He's giving me a nasty glare! He knows that I was the one who axed ACDC! I can feel his fury from here! Too bad! S-Stare me down all you want! I'll stare straight back at you, Cars! After I secure the Ultimate Aja from this soldier, I shall dismember you.Wham may be dying to duel you from his Greco-post, but I cannot allow the Ripple user who shredded ACDC to live any longer! Do you speak with the will of a warrior, or does the burning cry for vengeance speak for you, Cars?! Cars, pay attention! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim will be the last man you ever face! A metal man is no menace to me! Think again.He disjointed his arm to go completely around his head! His left arm must be prosthetic as well! Observe! Blimey! His digits can exert pressure of exactly 1950kg/cmÂ².Almost twice the pressure Santana could ever output! A BlÃdel you be! None can squander the scientific advancements of the Third Reich! We analyzed the data we acquired from Santana and infused these prosthetic arms with strength that overpowers his own! Therefore, Cars! If I use these arms to pluck away your flesh to a certain extent, it's been hypothesized that your bodily functions would cease to function! Alike the feathers being plucked from a bird, I shall tear your body into pieces that are each a centimeter in diameter! Herr Jojo! Yow! Do not pity me for what I have become For I am now the greatest magnum opus of the Third Reich, sculpted and crafted into a masterpiece! I have transcended all of humanity! Catch this, Cars! This Maschinengewehr has an average rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute, and is capable of penetrating through 30-mm-thick metal plating! This HMG will be the ticket to tearing your body to pieces! What part of him isn't machinery now?! Wh-What's all this ruckus? Downstairs! I will take the Ultimate Aja from you! Locating it cost ACDC his life, and I will not let his death be in vain! Shining The sword protruding from his arm is shining! I am called "Crystal Cars" for my mastery of the Shining Sword! Th-This cannot be The sword protruding from his arm is formed from the crystallization of his ulna or skin and he's not using it to deflect the b*ll*ts! He's defying the Laws of Physics by severing high-speed, spinning b*ll*ts in mid-flight! Why does that sword shine?! What's creating the light?! Mein Gott, he's coming straight at me! Wh-What's this sound?! As Cars made his advance, Stroheim observed and understood the secret of the Shining Sword! It wasn't just a sharp sword he was dealing with, but a high-speed, revolving chain of serrated teeth! An infinitesimal chain of sharp shark-teeth revolving in rapid succession around the sword! The crystal-structure of these teeth refract light, giving the illusion of a shining sword! I-I am still powerless! Even with these weapons and our advancements in Science, we are powerless to stop the Pillar Men! This "Santana" you refer to was naught but a whelp! A Neanderthal without thought! He was a peon in comparison to us! I think it's time I relieve you of the Ultimate Aja C-Cars! The shine of his sword is frigid enough to freeze It's sharp enough to slash straight through steel My bare hands can't defend against anything that sharp! If I even try to use the Ripple Fingers on him, I'd lose more than my fingers! If I could, I would run the Hell away right now! I don't stand a chance against Cars! I can't even think up a decent scheme against his sword! But I can't let him leave with the Ultimate Aja! If he uses it now to reach his ultimate evolutionary stage, then we're all buggered! Goddammit! I've got enough to deal with because of Wham's bloody ring, but now I've got to bear the brunt of Cars's choler! It's double-betrothal all over again! Is the Ultimate Aja in this pocket? It is, indeed! I've waited 4000, no, 5000 years to behold the luster of the Ultimate Aja! This was to have been mine from eons ago! Cars! Patiens! I will dismember you now! H-He's enraged, alright.This is a real pickle.He's got the Ultimate Aja now! Cars SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim has yet to be subdued! The technological advancements of the Third Reich have no equal! Shut your stupid mouth up, Stroheim! Why are you still trying to provoke him with your pomp?! Bathe in the light of my Ultraviolet Deathray! The gemstone's free! U-Uh it's sliding down the slope S-Scheisse! It's sliding down towards the cliff! If it falls into the chasm! Wh-What on Earth h-happened here? Cars! Get after the stone, Jojo! You've got a good lead over Cars! O-Oh crap Cars is making a bolt for the Ultimate Aja! And when he retrieves it, his momentum will send him straight into the chasm! He has no intention of stopping at the ledge! G-Goddammit! It's practically a 200-300 meter drop to the bottom! Cars could probably survive the fall without any issue, but I won't survive a fall that's around the height of the Empire State Building! C-Cars has caught up! Jojo's running with the intention of halting at the ledge, whereas Cars is dashing for a dive into the damned chasm! I can't let this twat have the Ultimate Aja! b*at him to it, Jojo! Jojo! When I catch up to and retrieve the Ultimate Aja, I'll be left vulnerable.You're going to make a lunge at me then, aren't you? Your main goal is to strike me with Ripple Energy, even if the Ultimate Aja falls into the chasm! Let's see how well your plan plays out! Jojo Is he! Spot on, Cars! I'll make a lunge at your back! H-He caught the chain of the Ultimate Aja around his foot! It's dangling like a damn pendant! What's with the belittling sneer? I'm the one who should be sneering, Cars! I figured you'd try to sneak off with it but you should've saved that idiotic idea for someone stupid! I lunged not at you, but at the snow beneath you, so I could actually stop myself before the free-fall! I retrieved the Ultimate Aja, not you! Have a nice trip, Cars! N-No way! That sword came outta his stinkin' foot! Jojo!!! Jojo! He's falling! H-His bloody blade's starting to assimilate into my body! Bugger off already! The distance to the bottom is exactly 170 meters! They'll crash into the chasm in about five seconds! I-I don't wanna plummet to my death if he's gonna survive the fall! Sticky Fingers! I-I'm too heavy! Ripple conductivity is at its highest with liquid matter, but crystalline solids are innately resistant, cutting Ripple conductivity! However, the heat generated by Joseph's hand is melting the icicle's surface, increasing Ripple conductivity and adhesion! I will have the Ultimate Aja, no matter the cost! H-Here we go again This tenacity of theirs is just terrifying! I can expose the vulnerabilities of my foes, but this Pillar Men Tenacity is just troublesome! It's like a bloody wild card to my ace in the hole! I will k*ll to have that stone! That glacial ledge has icicles too! I just need to free myself from this blade before landing! Wait! I could just channel the Ripple through this sword and straight into Cars! Time to croak, Cars! Typical! I knew that you'd attempt to channel the Ripple through my sole's sword! Therefore I need only kick you into the cliff! And now C-Cor blimey! H-He's unsheathed his Shining Sword! Cars threw Jojo into the cliff-face in order to have his body rebound, which will send Jojo back to him, straight into his sword! After I've given you a proper dismemberment, I'll retrieve the Ultimate Aja from the bottom of this chasm! No! Cut it, if you dare! You wouldn't risk destroying the Ultimate Aja to k*ll me, would you? My supporting scheme involves toying with your tenacity in attaining this stone! Here comes my Ripple Punt! You've used the Ripple to create a rope from the falling icicles by increasing adhesion! Unfortunately for you, there aren't enough falling icicles for you to use! Have no fear, I've got the length he requires right here! Caesar! I caught you just in time, Jojo! I demand an explanation! How could you two be so synchronized?! There's only one idiot who'd ever consider using icicles as a climbing rope.I knew that Jojo was the only guy idiotic enough to stir up this sort of scheme.That sums it up.Fortunately for me, you stooped to my strain of stupidity in order to realize my scheme.C-Come again?! You did good, mate! I'm chuffed to bits, Caesar m'boy! Also, if Lisa Lisa's up there with you, tell her that the Ultimate Aja's a-okay! I kept it from falling into Cars's grimy mitts! You were awful close though.Caesar, do pull him up immediately.I must admit, Crucco, your body's just chock-full of surprises, moreso than the Pillar Men.If you can refrain from your pompous banter, then perhaps we could cooperate.Jojo, I'll commend your fortitude.I'll grant you custody of the Ultimate Aja for only another day.Five Days Remain Until Marital Dissolution This is the face of the famous resort town of St.Moritz.The Mecca of Winter Sports, known also as the Sun Valley, it's an ideal destination for "refined adults" to seek some R&R.Or rather, it's a winter wonderland for the bloated buggers who can afford it! Even this cat has a pretentious prowl, as if they were the very reflection of their owner's snobbery.Oh, the snobbery! She didn't even reach for the shrimp tail! I'll bet this pretentious princess was protected from the problems of the people.Then let's see if a slice of smoked salmon will catch your fancy.A bite! Smoked salmon sits well with you, eh? All you gotta do is grab it.Just reach for it now Stretch those lanky legs of yours enough and checkmate! Caught you off guard, didn't I? The pretentious princess couldn't even nail a graceful landing.Boy, oh boy.I must admit, that was rather cruel of me.I'm losing my nerve as the days go by, and I've only got five left until that ring dissolves.Plus, I've got Crazy Cars to deal with now.The constant, yet impending thr*at of death is causing me to panic.Keep calm I've gotta keep calm in order to carry on, like I always do.Jojo, pay attention! Stand here and survey that structure with us.Sure! Be there in a jiffy.The address that ACDC had forwarded the parcel to matches that building.It's an abandoned, dilapidated hotel from the looks of things.It's an ideal defense from the day's share of sunlight.Every opening and window's been nailed shut with planks.No sunlight'll penetrate that hotel.Then Cars must be waiting for the sun to set from within, while also awaiting Wham's arrival.How should we proceed from here? We should seize this opportunity to att*ck! Agreed.While the sun still shines, Cars won't show his big-behind.Now is the time to strike! And you, Jojo? I am against this plan! We shouldn't strike while the sun's still out, not against him at least! We're facing a menace who's survived many millenia, solely on his wits.I'm certain that he's well-prepared for an afternoon as*ault! "Certain?!" He wants us to think that the path to him isn't laden with nasty surprises! Well I'm not falling for it! We'll be walking straight into his trap! Come on Jojo, you sound so reluctant.Where's that gusto of yours gone? "A crafty w*rlord wins his battles by making no mistakes." The Art of w*r emphasizes caution in a crowd of confidence, especially when there's little certainty of victory.Got cold feet, have you?! Cold feet?! If anything, my feet are calm, cool, and collected.I'd prefer that he come for us in the eve! But victory is certain! Cars is isolated and alone, while the four of us stand idle! We've got the numerical advantage so we should seize this opportunity, before Wham's arrival! Caesar, what's your bloody rush? You need to keep calm in order for us all to carry on.We'd be isolating ourselves by hurrying into his hideout! I am calm, and eager to exact vengeance! We both need to end the crusade our grandfathers started against the accursed Stone Mask! I will pulverize those Pillar Men! Vengeance?! For a codger you never knew?! Bollocks I say! If you were calm, you'd realize that k*lling yourself over a corpse is just crazy! Say that again, Jojo Why carry on the crusade of a codger you never met?! You'd be crazy to get yourself k*lled because of a corpse, you idiotic Italian! Caesar! You just crossed the line, Jojo! What line would that be, you-! Now you've done it! You deserved it! Stop smacking me already, Caesar! You started it, Jojo! Did not! Caesar, cease this nonsense! Jojo, stop your jabs! Caesar! Y-You bloody bozo Use your g*dd*mn head! What I say makes sense, doesn't it?! I thought you would've shared the same passion to end our grandfathers crusade as I, but I was wrong! I'm heading to the hotel.Caesar, Jojo's caution is not unfounded.We know nothing of the interior or layout of that hotel.We should wait until the eve to strike at Cars.My word is final, Caesar.Remember, your vengeance comes second to defending the Ultimate Aja.Forgive me, Maestra, but my vengeance comes first to me.Maestra, you know that my very blood burns for vengeance, because it was my own family that brought upon this calamity.The creator of the Stone Mask is near, and I will end the crusade of my grandfather! I can't stand by for the eve, while my family foe rests with ease! Mistress? Follow him, and if he even attempts an entry, bring him back bound.C-Caesar, why are you doing this? What's got you so fired up? Why can't you wait until we have an edge over him? Jojo.You struck a nerve regarding his very private past, unintentional, as it stands.A traumatic past that easily sends Caesar over the edge.His private past? Wh-What could've happened to him? I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time You've got my blood boiling, like my runt days in the Roman rookery! I was cold and cruel, and I will k*ll you! Very well! You have the honor of being hurled by wind of Whirlwind Wham! Episode 20 Caesar's Chilly Childhood
01x20 - Caesar's Lonely YouthQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:54Episode 20 Caesar's Chilly Childhood Caesar Zeppeli was born to the most famous furniture maker in Naples, Mario Zeppeli.Mario was a proud Neapolitan and a loving, reliable father of five, a man Caesar saw as his role model.But when Caesar was ten-years-old, that very same father walked out on his family without a word.Caesar's mother was already deceased, and the money left to Caesar and his siblings were swindled away by a distant relative.Caesar's disposition as a problem-child grew rampant, and his hatred for his father festered like a disease.I'll bet that prick shacked up with some whore and had another family! I'm gonna find and k*ll that culo, if it's the last thing I do! Caesar's youth was incinerated by his burning vengeance.He partook in several crimes including arson, battery, larceny, and petty theft.The only crime that hasn't sullied his hands is m*rder.His infamy made him a man to be feared, even by mafiosi.Be you the bambino who goes by Caesar? Whose son are you? I'm my own man! I'm sorry, you must not be Italian then.Y'see, we Italians like knowing who our fathers are.Caesar's regular routine of battery begins with an unrelenting wrench to the jaw, followed by an uppercut to his immobilized opponent.Caesar had yet to know that his fists were empowered with Ripple energy.And when Caesar was 16-years-old It's him That son of a bitch! he was ready to soil his hands after spotting his father in the streets of Rome.Alas! Wh-What are these things?! A diamond An embedded diamond.Giovane, don't touch that damn diamond! Vaffan-! What's with this wall? D-Don't touch these jewels They're booby traps Caesar was completely clueless to the crusade of his grandfather, Will A.Zeppeli, which led to his brutal death, and the dedication of his son, Mario Zeppeli, who traveled the world to learn the Art of Mystics for the sole purpose of defeating the very Pillar Men embedded within this wall.Caesar had no idea of the scope of their crusade.G-Giovane, hear my plea In Venice, there's a lady by the name of Lisa Lisa Only she knows how to deal with these damn things Whether it was by the pull of the wall or Caesar's matured visage, Mario was unable to recognize his own son in his final moments.Pa-! Caesar realized then Hurry! that his father left him and his siblings in order to keep them safe from the horrors of his crusade.Please, hurry Padre! Once, four folks arose from the fires of Hell Shijima no soko kara mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe and awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.Their ambition for power assembled Shinku no chishio ga the blood of a few bombastic braves.tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger! Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite He would exploit the flaws of the foes he faced! Yaiba surinuke yatsura no suki wo tsuke And his memory would live on for all posterity! Tsuranuita omoi ga mirai wo hiraku He's like a bloody storm! Atsuku like a bloody stone Red-hot like a bloody stone, ketsumyaku ni kizamareta innen ni but would he be ever free of the cursed fate of his family? Who can say, but the bonds of these braves Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna nigirishimete will never be buried.Caesar's Chilly Childhood Episode I get it now From that moment, his years of hatred for his father converted to profound pride for his family name.Caesar took up the cause of his father and began training in the Art of Mystics.Caesar owes Cars some payback for his pappy Sorry about that, Caesar.I had a cock-up about your granpappy with all the corpse-talk But if you're game to be walking straight into Cars's trap, then I'll bet you've got a scheme or two up your sleeve.I've changed my mind! If you're gonna as*ault Cars in the afternoon, then I'll be there to as*ault him with you, Caesar Zeppeli! Snowfall from last night left a fresh layer of snow and a pair of footprints.Wh-Who's that?! I could've sworn I saw something just now! Do my eyes deceive me?! They do not! They're honest! Who the Hell is that?! Caesar They've disappeared again! They can keep up this Harry Houdini act, but I know they've gotta be within five meters of me! Could this be one of Cars's tricks?! With the sun shining this bright, there's no way he could set foot outside! The Feline Feet! A fundamental stance in Wushu! Caesar is by no-means a practitioner of Wushu, but he instinctively adapted a flexible stance which would allow him to effectively anticipate and counter att*cks from any direction! Caesar! What's wrong with you?! The Mistress specifically told you not to attempt any entry! Stay where you are, Instructor Messina! I can't move a muscle now, let alone attempt an entry! Something's guarding the door leading within! "Something?" I see nothing, aside from snow-! Th-There's a footprint! It leapt! They're attacking from the air! You're Wham! Instructor Messina! This is bad! That was Wham, meaning that he and Cars are both holed up inside! But why?! How could Wham manage to bask in the sunlight?! Could it be related to his transparency?! Where is that provocative prattler at? I've heard of Jojo's remarkable growth from Master Cars.Where is the man responsible for Master ACDC's annihilation? Wind Wham possesses the mastery of wind, making his transparency the work of wind.And the pipes that are protruding from his abdomen are producing air.I can only barely make him out due to the steam from those pipes That's it! Those pipes are blowing out the steam in his abdomen, and he's coating his body with it! His body's undergoing the photorefractive effect! The steam surrounding him is causing sunlight to bend and refract, giving him a windbreaker from UV rays! That's why he seems transparent! Jojo's not with you.You are Caesar, the Bubble Blower, aye? Your reaction to my action was instinctive, leading me to believe that you too have grown as much as he.Very well! You will have the honor of being whacked by Whirlwind Wham first! "Whack" my ass, Wham! You've got my blood boiling back to when I was a rogue in the rookeries of Rome! Back, to when my proud father was ensnared by your booby trap! I was a cold and cruel criminal, and I will k*ll you! You think your wind'll burst my bubbles again, do you?! Well not this time! I've got the suds to slice through your wind! It's a technique inspired by Nonno Zeppeli's Ripple Ripper! Suds Saucers! They're high-speed, high-rotary spinning saucers of suds! The Ripple energy within each saucer makes them unburstable! Your windbreaker of steam is like a vacuum for my saucers to be sucked straight into your skin! H-His Ripple powers have improved vastly beyond my own expectations! You Mystic menace! You're not going back into the hotel without a few souvenirs! Skimming Suds Saucers! As you fall from being struck by my suds I'll finish you through my Ripple Kick! Wham's next reaction would shock Caesar! Caesar expected Wham to stabilize himself to stop from stumbling over in order to shorten the distance between himself and the hotel door.But instead of stopping Wham utilized the momentum of the fall to escape! Wh-Wham's no ordinary immortal ogre The intellect he displays in battle is nothing short of ingenious! But no matter his intelligence, he surely sustained severe wounds from my saucers Now I have the advantage! And I know just what scheme to use within to ensure my victory! At this moment, my senses are at the pinnacle of their peaks.I'm sensitive to even the slightest shift in the air.I'm on a high, like how I was back in the day.I'm without a bead of sweat, and my respiration's stable.I'll finish this fight with my reinforced Ripple powers! Instructor Messina! Are you ready to fight me without that windbreaker of yours now, Wham? They're gone! Both Caesar and Messina! Did they go inside the hotel already?! I-Is that an arm?! Be blown to bits, Wham! Bubble Blaster! I've burst these bubbles before! Suds Saucers! Fight me, you coward! I am no coward! Suds Saucers! You're washed up, Wham! Skimming Suds Saucers! Wham! Enough child's play! Savor my Sacred-! Hold your horses and survey your surroundings! The saucers I've unleashed have been orbiting the interior as Suds Lenses! Lenses? And that hole in the wall you escaped through is like the shutter of a camera, frozen in its photographic flash! The lenses will refract the UV rays of sunlight outside, and enlighten this interior! Sunlight?! You are paralyzed! Paralyzed into a strip of photographic film! Bathe and burn in the warmth, Wham! Deploying your windbreaker once more? Not while I'm around! This time, I'll finish you off directly with my Ripple energy! The single lunge in that single moment would cost Caesar dearly! The single moment when Caesar's body eclipsed the UV rays was the moment when Wham turned the tables on him! Once more, Caesar learned a painful lesson from the intellect of the weathered warrior! Surge forth Sacred Sandstorm! Th-This destructive force I-It couldn't be! could only come from Wham's Sacred Sandstorm! Then Caesar's been struck by it?! I am astounded by the strength of your growth I am sate Sate from a duel long overdue Master Mystic! My victory was but a close victory! Were it not for my Sacred Sandstorm which blasted back your Suds Lenses I would've succumbed to the sunlight of your saucers.Were Master Cars to have met and dueled you with his Shining Sword instead of my Sacred Sandstorm Master Cars would've emerged victorious, while sustaining injuries more grievous than my own.Enough.Your body now stands broken and battered from our battle.My Sacred Sandstorm has left your muscles and veins in shreds.Enough! Our duel is done.No longer will you feel even the slightest spark of Ripple energy, for you suffer from severe desanguination.The severity of this desanguination has doomed you to Death.Enough.Farewell.Go now, and begin your ascension.What?! The antidote to my wedding band?! What good would it do you? I fear not Death I am the proud successor to the Zeppeli family but I've failed in my crusade.An ogre would never understand the human value of family My father gave his life to save mine, unknowing that the life he saved was that of his own son's.Even Nonno relinquished his life and powers to save that of Jojo's grandfather, Jonathan.With the curtain of my life coming to a close, my final act must be as theirs! One final performance of panache before departing! My soul shines with the same zest of the Zeppeli men that preceded me! The zest of the human soul! Jojo!!! This is my Ripple of Rest! Take it away!!! Take it away!!! That was Caesar! That was Caesar's g*dd*mn shout! I heard it! Did something happen to him?! Caesar!!! He blew one last bubble with his blood.One last bubble infused with his remaining Ripple energy.He used his remaining energy to make a memento for Jojo, instead of channeling it into his fists Then he shall have it.I do not consider this an act of sympathy, but I do respect the strength and will of a warrior.An honorable warrior whose will and sacrifice is worthy of my respect.Your memory shall remain within my own for all eternity, Caesar A Mystic whose brief life burst as beautifully as the bubbles he bore.Th-The only tornado that could've torn through here is Wham's Sacred Sandstorm! If Caesar took his att*ck head-on! A bloody bubble Th-This couldn't possibly be Caesar's bandana is inside! And so is a ring! It's Wham's lip ring! This Ripple energy I feel is definitely C-Caesar's! Ever since we set foot in here, I tried so hard not to shout out for Caesar.I was too scared to shout out for him, because if I did and there wasn't any response from him, save for a serene silence, then I would know Know, what I tried so bloody hard to deny! But I can't deny it anymore I now know everything that happened in here from the sensation of that bubble, alone.Caesar d*ed shortly before we broke through! g*dd*mn him! g*dd*mn the snobbery of that irritable Eyetie! That prick left us stupid prezzies to boot! Caesar, where the Hell are you at?! Wakey-wakey! I'll dig you out, so just give me a sign, Caesar! Jojo! Do cease your sobbing and searching for Caesar already.Come again?! The odds are now even between them and ourselves.Two-on-two.That stairway of blood above is a real sigh of relief since Wham had surely sustained severe injuries from Caesar as well.We may be in their stronghold, but we'll still push on and persevere.Get to it, Jojo.Take that antidote and we'll begin our pursuit.Y-You heartless homegirl! Won't you shed a g*dd*mn tear or two for Caesar already?! Mistress Lisa Lisa your butt's backwards.Lisa Lisa is my Master, and as a master, she has to act cold to keep my focus fixed.But she's the one who really wants to wail n' weep for the man who looked to her as a mother and mentor.She's telling me to keep my eyes on the prize Caesar, I know I was a real selfish jerk in your eyes, but even I've learned to clue into the tune of another.Maybe I've matured some But when I m*rder them, they'll wish I was even more mature! I won't let your sacrifice be in vain! I-It's blood So Caesar's underneath Caesar Caesar! CAESAR!!! Within this hotel, Cars and Wham await the arrival of Jojo and Lisa Lisa, but their arrival will be postponed due to an outburst of emotion.Jojo screamed for Caesar ceaselessly, while Lisa Lisa shed tears for her tragic disciple.Jojo continued screaming with the expectation of hearing Caesar's shout, but it was not to be.Caesar was now deceased, and the serene silence that followed their anguished cries only affirmed this fact.His body may be gone, but his soul still lives on Under this slab, Caesar Zeppeli rests eternal.Next Time You've caught me in a foul mood.An embrace to end all embraces! When the full moon is at it's apex, we shall race! Both of you shall be broken before the break of dawn! Shine with me, Caesar! Episode Lisa Lisa's Long Sh
01x21 - The 100 vs 2 StrategyQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:54This hotel was originally constructed as a castle during the 14th Century.It was only remodeled into a hotel during the 20th Century, but when the landlord passed away in 1928, the hotels operations ceased.Cars was taken by the secluded hotel and used it as his stronghold against sunlight.Jojo and Lisa Lisa realized prior to their entry that they knew nothing of the hotel's interior, and may be entrapped in enemy territory.Shijima no soko kara Once, four folks arose from the fires of Hell mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe and awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.Their ambition for power assembled Shinku no chishio ga the blood of a few bombastic braves.tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger!

Tidy up the blasted place, will ya?! We're in foul enough moods already without these webs to worsen it! But this bloody trail is making me a bit cheery, since it tells me that Wham has indeed sustained severe injuries.Caesar slashed him up good before succumbing, I'll bet.We should finish him off before he recovers from his rest! Let's be on our way, Mistress Lisa Lisa! What's the matter? W-Well I find this creepy handle to be rather chilling.It's akin to holding the cold hand of another man.I am no door, ja?! Who was that?! Over here, Herr.And I am no door, ja?! He's a vampire! Back away from him! Jojo! If you weren't blocking me with those balls, I could've slashed the skin off your face, ja? I am Beck the Wire, ja? I was once imprisoned for strangling my sweetheart to death, but I made my escape and came across Master Cars, who offered me immortality, ja? He's my master, ja? And I won't allow you home-wrecking rats to disturb my masters' rest, ja? So, they've begun turning the populace into vampires for their own nourishment! Escaped, have you? Then personally, I think I'd better handle your execution, Escapee.Why don't you bend your head over and get ready for the guillotine? Mistress? You're a real sight for sore eyes, ja? Your skin's so silky-smooth too, ja? Let me embrace you, and I'll suck your blood to the last drop, ja? You've caught me in a foul mood.I'd rather be blind and deaf than see your filthy face and hear your shrill speech.However, you're welcome to try and attempt an embrace.An embrace leaving you anguished in your journey to the Afterlife.Spikes! Th-That's what cut 'em! His extra hand wasn't the one that split my bolas, but his spikes! He changed his body hair into wires and condensed them into sharp spikes! I despise it when women snub my sweet-talk, ja? It makes me want to strangle 'em more, ja? I'll embrace ja! I'll skewer and strangle ja in my loving embrace! Crikey! I didn't think he was that fast on his feet! Her muffler?! I get it! She's gonna channel Ripple energy into that muffler and use it on him! What's with the muffler? Are ja trying to strangle me with it? Hilarious, ja? It tears so easily, ja? Where are ja going? Let's continue on inside, Jojo.G-Got it.Her stroke was swift and as smooth as silk and the most effortless execution I've ever seen! Don't walk away from me, ja?! Herr Rat, that bitch deserves a good strangling, ja? Nein, ja yokel.You're finished, ja? She's done you in with her hold, ja? You been wrapped in the Ripple, ja? Who are you kidding, ja-! OHHHHH! NOOOOO! She's got a real handle on things! I thought her feminine side would make her frail n' feeble in a fight, but her technique is so much more refined than my own! Golly gee whiz! She's proved that her title of "Master" was well-earned! Jojo, you haven't taken the antidote Caesar left for you yet, have you? No, not yet Why? Well, I've decided to take the antidote after I whack Wham.When Caesar d*ed, he broke my "warrior's word of honor" with Wham, so I've sworn to Caesar that I wouldn't take this until after I've defeated Wham.Lisa Lisa, would you mind holding onto it until then? I would.It's not my burden to bear because I may already have another burden to bear.The further they pursued Wham into the hotel, the more they noticed that his trail of blood slowly turned into trickles.Jojo and Lisa Lisa were well aware of the symbolic meaning of these trickles for it represented the regeneration of Wham's wounds.They've arrived.I've been waiting for you Your growth is indeed remarkable, Jojo.I've got a bloody bone to pick with you, after what you did to Caesar-! Calm yourself, Jojo.Do divert your attention to the floor.Don't worry, Mistress.I am calm.I've seen the set of footprints on the floor, all right.The extra set, too.And they belong to Cars! Come out, come out, wherever you are! Stop hiding and show yourself! Yes, their footprints are the only ones which left a visible impression even though the respiration occurring within this room is several times their own! So it was her I see now.A wise woman with a warrior's intellect and perception.The force behind the miraculous growth of both Caesar and Jojo is now known to me! You've even sensed the abnormal respirations as well.You must be a master of the Art of Mystics! C-Cor blimey! Goddammit, they're all vampires! Are they mute, too?! That's rather unnerving! Cars! We are the Warriors of Night, hand-picked personally by Master Cars! We are one-hundred-strong, and on the command of our Master, we shall dissect and tear you two apart, Jojo! W-We're buggered! Mistress Lisa Lisa, what hope do we have against a hundred of 'em?! Master Cars, a moment! Jojo and I made an agreement to have our duel in the Colosseum, and avenging Master ACDC remains a prerogative.Master Cars, please acquiesce to our arranged duel! I shall not.Acquiring the Ultimate Aja always remains our main prerogative Make no mistake, Wham.Aiens.He makes a fine point, Wham! I ain't up for any duel, not anymore.I'm confident that I can defeat you, but even if I do, I've got a hundred vampires to face afterwards.Damned if I duel, damned if I don't.I just don't see the point anymore, especially if I'm doomed to die either way.I'm calling it quits Goddammit! They spotted my thread I thought I'd save myself the trouble of facing them with the Thread Shredder, too Minions, dismember them both! Dismember us, and the Ultimate Aja will be lost for all eternity.Cessatis! Speak sense, Woman! I am not so foolish as to deliver the very prize you seek so, straight into your hands.A device's been attached to the Ultimate Aja, and if neither Jojo nor I return by a certain time, the device will detonate, shattering the stone into shards.I won't buy into your provocation, Woman.But I'd wager that neither you nor your horde will find the stone in time.The expl*sive range itself is small, but it has enough force to leave the Ultimate Aja fractured.Did she seriously strap a time-b*mb onto the stone? It's news to me, but I'd better play along with her.She's not joking, Cars! We die, and bada-bing bada-boom, the stone's doomed.Be that as it may, I cannot allow either of you to leave alive! I agree, with a slight suggestion.I would allow Jojo and Wham to keep their arranged duel, and that would leave me to duel you, Cars.And the winner will receive the Ultimate Aja! Erk! Edepol! The winner will receive the Ultimate Aja, and the right to survive.Why prolong the inevitable? The battle for the Ultimate Aja and the future will end with one side left standing.Will the Pillar Men prevail, or will Humanity triumph? Curse you, Woman! Wham! Forgive my snicker, Master Cars.J-Jolly good! Lisa Lisa's long sh*t's even better than my own damn bluffs! You have bold words, Woman.I shall acquiesce and duel you for the Ultimate Aja! But make no mistake! Neither of you shall live to see the dawn! She's managed to bring us outta the fire and back into the frying pan! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's duel! Our duels will take place at another hour, in a more appropriate arena.When and where would you desire the duel, Wham? We duel tonight, when the full moon is at its apex.Our arena is located 15 kilometers south of here, at the base of Piz Berlina.We shall duel in the ancient hippodrome known as the "Skeleton Stone Heel." It is a sacred arena, where warriors came to claim glory from the heads of their fellows! A hippodrome?! Who said that you'd get to pick?! I ain't letting you two have the upper-hand! A peculiar, yet perfect arena for our duels, Wham.And in regards to the Ultimate Aja, Jojo You are to bring the stone to the hippodrome at the stroke of midnight, tonight.Without the expl*sive device, of course.Your master shall remain with us as our hostage! Lisa Lisa! They're ensuring that neither of us can renege on our word.I would do the same.Jojo, be a good boy and fetch the Ultimate Aja.You know where to look.I will, and I'll bring it straight to the arena.Believe me, Mistress.I already do.Caesar It was only yesterday when I stopped being such a self-absorbed bell-end.And this enigmatic emotion that has me on fire Could it be "compassion" for my fellow man? Goddammit! If only I could bash both their heads in now! Out of compassion, I swear to Messina, Lisa Lisa, and to Caesar's spirit, that I'll end this crusade! She didn't attach any time-b*mb to it, after all.Even I might've caved if they called me on that big of a bluff, you crazy cheat! Should I bring her a change of undergarments, or not? Who's this old crone? It's Nanna Erina! Why's Lisa Lisa carrying a picture of her around? What's with this one? "May 22, 1889." It's 49-years-old! Could this dashing gent be Great-Uncle?! Nanna Erina?! And Straits, holding a baby in his arms?! Lisa Lisa Come to think of it, I don't know a damn thing about her past, her present, nada.But why would she have these photographs? It's the genuine article.We shall keep our word as well and duel you both, one-on-one.Since you spotted these two photographs already, then I suppose I have some explaining to do.I was going to open up before your duel, regardless.Who are you? In 1889, Miss Erina lost her husband, Jonathan Joestar, on their honeymoon voyage over the Atlantic.Your grandfather, I'm sure you know.Before the ship sunk, Miss Erina saved the life of a little lass.That little lass was me.The little lass in that photo was me.H-Hold it If that was you 49 years ago If you were a baby 49 years ago h-how old would that make you, exactly?! F-Fifty, perhaps?! I-I-I-I-If you're in your fifties, then aren't you a-an old bag?! The math makes sense B-But you look like you're still in your late twenties.The Art of Mystics utilizes lifeforce, so I suppose your appearance could be maintained with the Ripple But that also explains why you're such an uncute, cold, old crone What if I said that I could see crows feet under your eyes? Minions, ready the arena for our duels! Light the cauldron! We're short on time for the full explanation but I'll cover what I can.You and I are related in many ways.Related? My parents d*ed due to the Stone Mask, and after Miss Erina saved my little life, her pregnancy made caring for me difficult, so she entrusted me into Straits's care.Sh-She gave you to Straits?! He disciplined me into the Art of Mystics, and entrusted me with the Ultimate Aja, as well.S-So basically, Straits was your foster father?! He was, and it brought me to sorrow to hear that old age drove him to madness.To be honest, I have conflicting feelings because of your hand in his death, but all life eventually ends in Death.Well I'll be damned C-Could this get any more awkward? I k*lled my Master's only father-figure Lisa Lisa's led a sorrowful life, just like Nanna Erina and I We're out of time for talk, Jojo.Wh-What's with these quakes?! They're ready.At last, the true duel can be underway with them Wh-What are they?! Make way! Those who don't will be trampled to death! Wh-What are those, dinosaurs?! N-No wait, they're horses, aren't they!? My Masters, make way for the chariot! The strength of these beasts bests my own! Master Wham, make way! These are excellent w*r horses.These horses had their brains pierced by the Stone Mask's spines, evolving them into Vampequines."V-Vampequines?!" Wham and Jojo's duel in this arena shall commence in the ceremony of chariot combat! "Chariot combat?!" Aye, akin to the gladiator-driven chariot races of the Roman Republic.You are to race these horses around the arena while dueling your opponent! Either driver may fall from the chariot, leading to an inevitable trampling, or be fatally struck by the opposing driver during the race! The victor is the last man standing! You're in for a ride, Jojo! Vampequines draw these chariots with the strength of 150 horses! Even Master Wham will struggle to hold tight to the reins! Wait a bloody second here! I'm game for chariot combat, chariot racing, whatever floats your boat, but not with these "vampequines!" They're your loyal lackeys, no?! Fret not.The reins are designed to conduct Ripple energy.Wham will control the horses with his sheer strength, but you will be able to steer the Vampequines with your Ripple energy.A-Are you sure about that? They look rather rabid Watch your hand there! You may steer them with minimal Ripple energy.Wham! Wham has adorned the garments of gladiators for this duel.He is determined.Determined to exterminate his foe, which is made ever-evident with his visage.Defeat him, Jojo.Humanity must triumph this morning! Show no mercy! Wham! I don't plan on taking your damn antidote until after I've kept my promise to Caesar, and pounded you into pudding.And this promise will imbue me with strength greater than I've ever known! Shine with me, Caesar! Let's ride, Vampequines! Next Time Wham! Cedo! Episode Gallant Gladiator
01x22 - A True WarriorQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:55To the victor, the Ultimate Aja! Jojo and Wham's ceremony of chariot combat shall be the first of two duels to commence! You may begin your duel when the moonlight is no longer obscured by the passing cloud above! Wham! Shut yer filthy flaps up already! Where are my cheerleaders, eh? One lap around the track is 960 meters, and these vampequines can easily make that one lap in one minute.Also, look to the pillar yonder.There will be a w*apon or two for us to take from that pillar after every lap.w*apon? The first to reach the w*apon will be the sole wielder for the entirety of the race.And the w*apon for this first lap is the Herculean Hammer! One stroke of that hammer would blow this chariot off to kingdom come! If Wham reaches it before I do, not only would I be buggered, but I'd be indubitably buggered! But if I were to take it before him, and coat it in oil to increase Ripple conductivity, he'd be indubitably buggered! I expect a battle of epic proportions from you, Jojo.The moon has neared the edge of the cloud The moonlight shall soon shine once more! Jojo, why are you off your chariot?! The moonlight will shine soon! You don't have to tell me twice, but a brisk start is the key to victory.I need to clear the rubble that's underneath my wheels.Hey Wham, there's a bit of rubble underneath your wheels, too.I'd clear them if I were you.Jojo, get back on your chariot! Jojo! Cedo! Episode Gallant Gladiators Cedo! What the-! M-Master Wham's spurt has been stalled! There's rubble under the wheel! He threw them underneath! That was quite crafty of him.Curses! While we were watching the moon unveil, he stooped to such trickery! Yer a dirty deceiver! Chiseler! Coming from decrepit corpses, I'll take that as a compliment! In a duel to the death, there's no shame in being a little dirty! No limits, no restrictions, all manner of foul play is fair game, you stinkers! He's approaching the first pillar! k*ll the human! Jojo will take the Herculean Hammer Why, good evening to you there! I'll hold you soon, my dear hammer! You're mine now! Th-The breakneck speed of these steeds is loosening my grip! Oh, Hell! Jojo! Whoa! I caught it on the ring on my bloody pinkie! A-At least I have the upper-hand on Wham now! And he's defenseless! You may have that hammer.It was never my desired w*apon to begin with.Wham has a plan for this man.A painful plan, concocted from the wisdom of a warrior! I have one greased Herculean Hammer that's ready to wreck! It's just waiting to smash your skull in, Wham! Wham's decreased the speed of his steeds Speed is not of the essence in chariot combat, but the rider's equestrianism and use of weaponry are both key to victory.As well as their instinctive tact.I think it's high-time I hold these horses up, so I can whack Wham once and for all! Jojo, you don't want to slow your steeds' speed there! You may have a hammer, but I Well Wham, are you ready to give a big, warm welcome for this here hammer of mine? Look! That happy-face he had from holding his hammer has all but vanished! H-His creative craft for warfare has exceeded my own! Damn! Jojo, lash your steeds and increase your speed! Too late! My stroke has forced you to abandon both your chariot and horses! The duel was done from the moment the pillar fell.How will he avoid my horses now? Jojo! The odds of the Vampequines trampling him to death is incredibly high, while the odds of him dodging either horse is incredibly low.Well Jojo, how will your cunning save you from this circumstance? M-My hammer Where's my hammer?! He wants his hammer?! He's got bigger things to worry about! He might as well hammer his own head with it now! He has to avoid those horses, but when he does, Wham will most likely halt his horses and slay Jojo with his Sacred Sandstorm! But above all odds, Jojo dashed straight for the oncoming horses! Good thinking, Jojo! Way to use your hammer! He slammed his hammer down onto the pole between the horses! The horses saddled forth from the strike! Jojo had used the Herculean Hammer to heave himself into the air! I-Inconceivable! He propelled himself above forelegs of the horses and escaped unscathed! Hot damn! And now, I think it's high-time that I play "Whack-a-Wham!" He's gone?! B-But where to?! The wisdom of Wham will always overwhelm that of your whelp's! I-I forgot! They can conceal themselves within the bodies of other organisms! Nice try! H-He left his boot! If it wasn't for that blasted boot Master Wham could've held his foot firm to the Vampequine! The jig is up! It was over the moment your ring caught this hammer for me! Lady Luck's smiling sweet fer me! Look at what you've done to yourself, Wham! You've trapped yourself inside the Vampequine and left yourself without a way to escape! Heave-ho! Be Rippled to bits, along with this horse of yours! The fool has yet to realize his own folly! Back off, Jojo! Get as far away from Wham as you can! Even after assimilating with the horse, Wham was never limited to just one arm! Neither was the Vampequines pace an issue for him! Meaning he'll be struck by the full extent of Wham's fatal flurry, as Caesar was! Savor my Sacred Sandstorm! The duration of this duel lasted about half a lap, but I admit that I found it to be fairly intriguing on two to three levels.Ultimately, not even that provocateur could best Wham's perfected prowess and psyche.I am to duel you next, but in all honesty, I derive little delectation from dueling a woman, as would Wham.Nevertheless, all meddlesome Mystics must ultimately meet their extinction.Neca te ipsum.The poison leads to a painless path.Jumped to conclusions, have you? Their duel has not yet ended, you dimwit.M-Master Cars, behold Master Wham! Impossible! Both of Master Wham's arms have been nearly severed! H-How could this be H-How and when were Wham's arms injured so?! Master, Jojo has awoken from the blow! He's moving, too! F-Fooled you once, fooled you twice! H-He was even struck by the full force of the Sacred Sandstorm Y-Yet, he lives! "Full force?" It was the full force of Jojo's craftiness that convinced you of his defeat.He's a chiseler by nature, and the best bluffer I know.Neither traits are commendable by convention.Behold Wham's waist, and the pieces will fall in place.C-Could he have tied Wham's arms together with reins which carried Ripple energy?! That would explain the sapped strength of the Sacred Sandstorm! When Wham reached to grab a hold of my leg, I figured that he could also use his other arm to strike me with the Sacred Sandstorm.I had to be a step ahead of him! Behold the visage of Master Wham! His face is pale and drenched in sweat! Master Wham's focus is also lost to the sky! Wh-What will we do?! They're entering the second lap! B-But how could furnish the pillar when Master Wham appears so bewildered?! Does Master Wham have any will left to duel?! He has been left aghast.Never before, has his most prided technique been desecrated so by Ripple energy.He's been left bereft of the pluck and pride he's procured over several thousands of years.The weathered warrior has never been left flabbergasted so by the bitter taste of plausible defeat.But "plausible" it remains! Hurry, and take the weapons for the second lap into the arena! That's Master Cars's signal! Then the riders shall have their weapons! The weapons for the second lap are the Cannonball Crossbows! Both crossbows come equipped with two cannonballs, and either rider may choose the larger or smaller of crossbows! W-Wait, there are two sizes to choose from now?! Lisa Lisa, perhaps the following thought is passing through your mind."Wham no longer maintains the focus needed to continue this duel, and yet, Cars still gave them weapons, aware of this handicap.It just doesn't make sense." Then let me enlighten you.I gave my handicapped rider weapons because he is alike a gallant gladiator of yore.In professional sports, there is an recovery ritual known as the "Handicap Hurdle." When athletes find themselves suffering the emotional setbacks from a handicap, they find a way to hurdle themselves over that handicap with a stimulus.The greater the emotional setback, the greater the necessitated stimulus.And Wham's necessitated stimulus was B-Bloody Hell! What's he done to himself?! M-Master Wham has gouged out his own eyes with his thumbs! I relied excessively upon my sense of sight and thus, was my sight exploited.But now, my sole sense of sight shall come from the wind against my horn! He stimulated himself so, that his focus shall remain forever fixed.Wham will no longer be hindered by any handicap.He's overcome his loss of eyesight with his "anemometer" of a horn, and will use the wind to perceive the projection of his foe.W-Well, whoop-de-doo! Gouging out your eyes changes nothing! What we gained from the stimulus of losing Caesar was the kick-in-our-arses your eye-gouging could never give! Which crossbow will you choose, Chiseler? Which will I choose? Obviously I'll choose the colossal crossbow! It packs a bigger punch than the other one! The punch is bigger, all right Indeed, it is.Wh-What the-! I can't pull the string back into the latch! I-It's a stiff string! Is it even physically possible for me to pull it back?! Serves you right! You'd need a conventional pulley to pull back the stiff string on that crossbow! Misfortune befalls the overambitious, doesn't it?! My first cannonball shall guide me to his gust.I've gauged the distance between our chariots.My final cannonball shall strike him down! Crikey! How can I pull this bloody string back?! Master Wham, trample that prattler into pÃ¢tÃ© for us! We shall dine upon the "pÃ¢tÃ©" of his remains! I-I figured as much! His horn can't discern my wind when there's a bloody bonfire blazing between us! Time to pull this string! Does he think a little heat will halt Wham's will? M-Master Wham is aiming his w*apon at us! He's turned his focus from the flame! Jojo will always be riding by the flame and exactly opposite of Wham.Therefore, Wham already knows where he is! So he's trying to deflect his sh*t off the walls, like the deflectors on a roulette table?! Bloody-! His ball struck me from behind?! I surveyed the entirety of the arena during our duel, and found a wall which would deflect my ball.B-Breathe! The ricocheted cannonball stopped short of hollowing his body out, but his expulsion of blood would imply intestinal injury.k*ll him, Wham! But be wary of his craft and cunning.Approach with caution! Will he attempt a counterattack? Wh-When the crossbow fell to the ground, the string reached the latch! I-I have to take him by surprise! I need him to be closer Close enough to make the sh*t count! N-Now! A counterattack! A commendable effort, but an absolute stray sh*t, nontheless.You have my respect for attempting to mount one final offensive.It's time, Jojo! B-Back off! G-Get the Hell away from me! Stay away! Just stay away! I'm begging you! H-Have mercy on me, Wham! Jojo! The chiseler's tossing pebbles at Master Wham! He's a coward, and a contemptible chiseler! Why dont'cha die with some pride, Poltroon?! Wh-Wham, you're gonna wail on me with the following "Don't you dare desecrate the sanctity of our duel, Jojo!" Don't you dare desecrate the sanctity of our duel with your cowardice, Jojo! Have some more! Even blinded bats could fly about and dodge these pebbles when it's sunny outside! But can you dodge what you can't hear, Wham?! Th-That cannonball he fired struck Master Wham from behind! D-Damn you Tricked you twice, tricked you thrice! I followed your cannonball's path of trajectory to strike you, like you did me! Silence befell the arena.Not a sound was stirred.Not a murmur was muttered.All eyes were focused on the hole hollowed out from Wham's chest, like the lid atop a pumpkin.The cannonball was small, but was imbued with Ripple energy.Wham's wounds begin to sizzle.The Ripple has now ruined Wham's arms, effectively sealing his Sacred Sandstorm forever.I-I need to use Ripple Respiration to recover You thought you could fool me with your falling feint, eh?! Well, you should've thought twice before lashing out! Ripple of Repulsion! He's won! Wham may no longer rise! H-How could I be reduced so How could I be humiliated so How could I allow my body of 12,000 years to be battered and broken so! W-Wait, both of his arms are gone! To seize victory, my foes must be forced to struggle and suffer! Though I am wrought with wicked wounds, and my strength has suffered such strain, I will use that which remains to grasp my victory! What-?! He's torn them He's torn both his arms off and fired them from the cavity in his chest! The bloody Hell! G-Goddammit! I can't use Ripple Respiration while he's strangling me! W-Wind? Why is there wind swirling around him?! I shall unleash my ultimate technique! His ultimate technique?! H-He wouldn't! Wait, Wham! Cease compression, now! Th-The wind's being sucked into his pipes! Witness my Wind of Destruction! I will remember you Your silhouette will charge the view Of distance atmosphere Call it morning driving thru the sound and Even in the valley In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they Stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching Down on the land Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees The rim of the land The eagle's dancing wings create as weather Spins out of hand Next Time Scatter, you scum! I will do what I must The posture he strikes You just crossed the g*dd*mn line to lunacy! Only one may stand tall above all other organisms! Episode Waning into the Wind

Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna Who can say, but the bonds of these braves nigirishimete will never be buried.Episode Waning into the Wind W-Wind? Why is there wind swirling around him?! Witness my Wind of Destruction! Wh-What kind of wind is this?! Your seat by the flame obscures my sight Jojo, I cannot clearly define your projection, but as you now suffocate from strangulation, you are powerless to avoid my Wind of Destruction as it inches towards you! Towards total decapitation! Wham's Wind of Destruction is his ultimate technique.The very pipes he used with steam to shield himself from sunlight may also be used to intake a great deal of air which will undergo ultra-compression within his lungs.He then forces the air to exit through a small slit in his horn using ultrahigh-pressure, which manifests as a small cyclone.However, in order to accommodate the ultrahigh-pressure, his body undergoes extreme strain.Strain so extreme, that his body begins deteriorating as a consequence of usage.But I find that frailty to be quite captivating.Do decapitate him for me! Do so, and I shall acquire the human blood required for your rejuvenation! Jojo! I-It's close! I need to cook up a scheme, quick! I'll use my canteen of kerosene! H-His pipes are sucking all the wind into his gut like suction tubes, but if I can splash his pipes with this kerosene and flame, they'll suck up all the flaming vapor and cause an implosion! This is literally my last ace in the hole! It's do-or-die now! I have you now! Goddammit! Suck on this, Wham! An expl*sive lamp? Pathetic.I may pierce any projectile flying within one-meter of my being.Your schemes are all but spent, and your burning bark has betrayed your bearings.Witness my Wind of Destruction! Caesar!!! Save my skin! Another attempt to light the lamp? Try as you may, but my wind will blow away anything within a meter of me! And now, our duel will finally end after I've decapitated you! Jojo! A-At long last Wham Your defeat was determined from the moment I tossed Caesar's bandana at you.I wanted you to slice my canteen in half, you half-wit! Your pipes' ceaseless suction of the canteen's contents was essential to your defeat! You've been sucking aerosolized kerosene vapor into your gut, as well as Caesar's shredded bandana! The The flames are still lit, and my pipes are sucking the flames within! Wham, you were the most adept adversary I've ever had, but the combined effort of my fallen friend and I defeated you in the end.H-He lost Master Wham's been whacked! Remember Jojo, all Pillar Men can recover from any injuries sustained, even from explosions! The only certain way to defeat them is by channeling Ripple energy on contact! O-Our duel has finally ended Jojo It did.Have you avenged Caesar? I have.Then go, and deal unto me Death.I will! What are you doing?! The fumes curling up from your head's not smoke from the implosion, but vapor from being ruined by the Ripple.Ruin which originated from the energy that I had channeled into your chest and legs.I've seen how much suffering the Ripple brings your people, and although your body's blasted to bits, the least I could do is alleviate your anguish with my blood.How dare you! Do not force me to suffer in such shame! I need not your sympathy! "Sympathy?" You wanna talk to me about "sympathy?" Then tell me why you left the blood bubble containing Caesar's bandana and your ring intact.Was it out of sympathy? I left his bubble because he was a proud and honorable warrior! I only paid my respects to an honorable warrior! You'll now spout, "Are you doing the same?!" Are you doing the same?! You bet I am.Respect is to be paid to my adversary, and my solemn respect is due to my fallen fellow, Caesar.Even after everything you put me through, I cannot help but pay my respects to you.And paid it was, in my blood.You've left me in utter defeat, Jojo.It seems that your warrior ways are more wondrous than my own.k*ll him! Halt! Stay your hands! Scatter, you scum! Wham! Wh-Why did you do that?! I am dedicated to Master Cars until the end, but I will not tolerate such treachery from our servants.I left Caesar's bubble whole out of respect, not sympathy.I acknowledge only the strength and will of a warrior.And only the victor may respect the final will of his fallen foe.It is this very will in which I've disciplined myself.Jojo Not once, have I ever yearned to prolong the eternal life that I've been endowed So long as I could wither away in this will of my own.Now keep your word and take the antidote.Before I am reduced to ashes.How will you know? I need not rely on my view, wind, or words.Your actions will speak the truth to my ears.My life is fulfilled.I am truly overjoyed to have witnessed your miraculous growth.Perhaps I spent these 12,000 years of my life in search of you.Aeternum vale, Jojo Wham waned into the wind.As Jojo watched, he unconsciously shifted his stance into a salute to the fallen warrior.He shed not a single tear, but his silence served as a eulogy for his enemy.He felt an unusual fellowship between himself and Wham.Wham, I order you to k*ll him.I-If I may have a word, Master Cars The object of your aggression is but a boy! A boy he be, but he must die.The child of Mystics must never mature into adulthood, lest he becomes a great thr*at to our survival.It takes only a decade for a boy to become a man! k*ll him now, Wham! If your warrior's will withholds your hand, then allow me to illustrate how our survival is ensured! A swift stroke is all it takes! Wham Your wholehearted warrior's will was what wasted you away! It wasted away your will to win! Wham whacked the bucket.I had me rations riding on the rotter, too.And what a wuss he was! The filth of these fools doesn't fail to foul the mood.M-Master Cars! Y-You're sucking me dry! I am all that's left of the Pillar Men However, there need only be one to stand omnipotent over all others! Master Cars has finally tossed his turban! He's ready to duel! But there's no need for Master Cars to sully his own hands on these humans! To Hell with the duel! We'll k*ll 'em both for ye! I'll be the first to bathe in their blood! They were gonna ambush us, after all! Do recall our arrangement.Th-The Ultimate Aja! I, and I alone, am to duel Cars.And if any were to interfere and renege upon our arrangement, then I will smash the Ultimate Aja into shards! I gave you my word, and I will duel you alone, as I had always intended.The very unveiling of my horns signifies my intention to duel you.These filthy few who've dared to thr*aten our arrangement have already fallen.Master Cars?! I will attain the Ultimate Aja, for the sake of my fallen fellows of several millenia.I will duel you with the exact dignity they both displayed in battle.You meddlesome Mystics will be massacred by me, for I must now avenge both of my fallen fellows.And Lisa Lisa, the aggression you've shown my minions was nothing short of masculine.It is a man I face, and a man I shall mutilate! Follow me! This shall be our arena! It is the Shrine of Skeleton Heel Stone! Long ago, the victors of chariot combat would ascend this shrine and drink a mixture made from their fallen foe's blood with wine.They would thank their gods who've graced them with longer lives.An arena it is not, but it is ideal for an invigorating duel.M-Mistress Lisa Lisa! You may be the Master, but you're still just a woman! He seems a lot weaker than Wham was, so let me duel him instead! Too bad.I don't need the burden of having a boy worry about an old mare like me! F-Fearsome-Fifties are fierce! As I maintain mastery over the Shining Sword, it would be unworthy of the will of Wham to not offer you a w*apon as well.You may use any of those arms.My muffler is my arm.So be it.Let us begin.Th-This aura that he emanates is bereft of bloodlust.How will he duel me without the will to k*ll? Won't you come at me already? Then I will act first! Cars has concealed himself with that small shine of light! Where's he gone?! C-Cars's aura has vanished It's almost as if he could ambush me from anywhere! Shining Sword! He hid himself within the fissure of that pillar! Mamba Muffler! This muffler was made from the intestines of many Satypolasia beetles, and is incredibly conductive to Ripple energy! It works both as a w*apon and a lifeforce locater! It's what gives me eyes around the back of my head! H-He's dead! The Master massacred that mook! Cars was a wimp compared to Wham, but cocksure jerks are always k*lled-off quick! I always knew she had more moxie than me- M-Master Cars! C-Cars is behind her?! Th-Then who the Hell did she hit?! N-No way! That can't be true! Cars's wasn't dueling her at all! It was his look-alike! Damn the duel.Damn the arrangement.Damn everything, save for my acquisition of the Ultimate Aja, so that I may become the True Omnipotent Organism.I have no will of a warrior alike the likes of Wham! I will use any and all means at my disposal to s*ab Defeat through the heart! Th-That's why his aura felt so bereft of bloodlust He never intended to duel me at all On the ground! Jojo The Ultimate Aja is mine! Now my minions, go and mutilate Jojo with all your might! C-Cars! Now you've done it! Get outta my way, you jagoffs! I'm gonna bust your bloody brains in! Zoom Punch! Yer Ripple powers are worn.He's exhausted his Ripple energy-! Ripple of Repulsion! You have yet to fully recover from your duel with Wham.Your respiration is in disarray, reducing the potency of your Ripple powers.No matter how well your master maximized your strength and stamina, you won't last long against my whole horde! Jojo Just how long will you last? Y-You goddamned son of a! Tear him apart, boys! C-Cor blimey! U-Ultraviolet light?! I know that mug! Hear me, you vile vampires! SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim and the SS of the Third Reich shall silence you! The Speedwagon Foundation's Special Task Force shall join them as well! Jojo! Yo, Jojo! G-Great-Uncle Speedwagon! And my buddy from the Big Apple, Smokey Brown! My right leg is rearing up for vampire violation! The repairs to my body have finally finished as well! And now, allow me to introduce our newest venom against vampires! The Uber Ultraviolet Ray Cannons! It was actually my foundation that succeeded in mass-producing the mobile models, but he was quite adamant on adding a dash of Deutsch.So the trivial tools of the Teutons have returned Jojo is gone! Where has he jolted off to? The swiftness of your sprint never ceases to surprise.My eyes need only wander for a moment, and you'll spring me with your next scheme.You've crossed the bloody line over into lunacy.You gave your word that you would duel Lisa Lisa, but you used some slimy tactics to s*ab her in the back! Overall, your dishonorable conduct has besmirched the warrior's will of Wham! Agitated, are we? Well do try to calm yourself.Do understand that I would do anything to achieve my main prerogative, no matter the indecency of my implemented tactics.I did that which carried the least amount of risk and worry, and played the game at my own pace.Victory to the most patient of players! And now, you shall suffer from this new game that we shall engage in.Never before have I loathed anyone with the same malice that I do you! You loathe me? Then let's alleviate your loathing! If it's a duel with me that you desire, then a duel with me you shall have! Lisa Lisa is lapsing within the limbo between Life and Death, exactly as I wanted her.I left her with as little life as possible.Would you like to know why? She still has a part to play in our game.In fact, her part is quite literally tied yours.Twang Twaaang You sick, twisted I've threaded rope through the holes in her feet, Jojo.Would you like to know why?! It's because Li-Lisa Lisa! catching her is your part in our game! If you don't grab ahold of her rope, she'll be skewered by the crystals below! J-Jojo! Lisa Lisa! Li-Lisa Lisa?! Isn't that the baby Nanna Erina saved from that sinking ship during her honeymoon? I-If that's her, then she's actually Jojo's You are to remain paralyzed in that position.My tactics have left you trapped, Jojo! I will slowly, but surely, advance towards you and dismember you at my own leisurely pace! g*dd*mn you, Cars! g*dd*mn you to Hell and back! Jojo doesn't know that Lisa Lisa is actually his mother! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Mop up the rest of those vampires already!

Damn you, Cars! Damn you to Hell and back! Jojo doesn't know that Lisa Lisa is actually his mother!

It takes more than a minute or two to slaughter all diese Scheisser, ja?! Verdammt! Die, Damonen! Dammit! Stroheim and his SS have their hands full! Jojo! Hold hard to that rope, or she'll slip from your grip.The range of your reactive lunges have been severely limited by the length of this little rope, aye?! Cars didn't receive any Ripple energy from slashing Jojo's leg?! Th-That ain't no good! Your respiration's in disarray, and your Ripple energy's exhausted.Ergo, I may assume that you possess just enough energy for one final att*ck.I will pluck the pulp of Life from you, alike petals being plucked from a flower.Cars! To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure if I can force any energy outta me.I'm really not.But nevertheless I've cooked up a new scheme! A scheme that'll sweep you off your feet! Are you dying to know what my ingenious scheme is? Well I ain't tellin'! Jojo! It better not involve tying Lisa Lisa's rope to your own! It's the flame from a match!

The Ultimate Aja is finally mine, and the Mystics are no more! The rope?! But how?! It's tied around Jojo's ankle! But when did he tie it around his ankle?! I never gave him an opportunity to When he made his first lunge, he swung the rope around his leg so that I'd sever a spare rope for him! Then, he secretly tied the spare rope around his ankle and Lisa Lisa's rope, and made a loop from it.And this all went unnoticed due to his diversion with the flaming muffler.He even managed to lure me into his damned loop! That provocateur purposely provoked me into severing Lisa Lisa's rope to do it, too! Curse your accursed deceit! Now, your role is to support both of our weights combined! You're a deceptive deceiver, Jojo! It doesn't feel good to be on the receiving end, does it?! You're a decent deceiver, but I suppose you don't handle being deceived too well! You've been around for tens of thousands of years, but the only way you'll ever match my smarts is by spending ten years in the modern day, Cars! Get ready for the Ripple! Ripple of Repulsion! D-Did I get him?! Th-That was the last of my energy! My Ripple energy's all spent! I can't channel another bloody Ripple I-I channeled it into him! He did it! He sure did! He cracked Cars with the Ripple! Not you! C-Curse you! Look! Cars has been impaled by the crystal spikes from his fall! He's finally fallen! Behold! Ripple energy is starting to spread straight up his arm! He is now weakened! He is now finished! Even our Uber weapons could k*ll him now! That was shocking, ja? But now, he's ours for the taking! Ready the Ultra-Uber Ultraviolet Ray Cannon! Jawohl! Mistress Lisa Lisa Cars said that he'd left a smidgen of life in you Supposedly, he stopped short of striking your vitals.If we patch you up now, I think you'll live to see the sun rise again.It's over At long last Say, Mister Speedwagon? Mind if I pry a bit? What is it? Why did Nanna Erina tell Jojo a straight fib? That his mother passed away ill during his childhood? Why was Miss Lisa Lisa hiding the truth from her own son? Smokey, I can't I know you asked me not to ask Nanna herself, but I wanna know.They're family, right? Why do they need to hide that from each other? Smokey I consider Nanna Erina and Jojo to be good homies of mine.They both stood up for me against a r*cist and two corrupt coppers back in NYC All for a rotten hood like myself! I flew here for my homie, and I always wanna have his back! All right, Smokey.I'll tell you the story.You did do a gentleman's duty by looking after Miss Erina during my absence.But you are never to tell Jojo a word! This is an affair between members of the Joestar Estate, and we outsiders may not interfere with their wishes."Lisa Lisa" is an alias An alias for "Elisabeth." She was raised by Ripple Master Straits, and eventually met, romanced, and married Miss Erina's son, George Joestar II.George and Elisabeth eventually had their one and only son, Joseph.George was a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and even with the unexpected advent of aerial warfare during World w*r I, nothing stopped George from taking to the skies with his wings.His spectacular performance in the RAF earned him the popular nickname of "The Blue Baron!" However a foul stench surfaced from the sewers of the past to sicken us once more! 49 years ago, Dio Brando created his very own horde of vampires.Both Straits and I were certain of their extermination by our own hands, but alas! One escaped us and went into hiding, where they lived incognito for decades! And that vampire was one smart stinker, all right He never made a horde of his own, and he even devoured every bone and hair strand on his prey in order to avoid drawing attention to his true nature.I was dumbstruck to discover that he was a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force! Th-The RAF?! The same RAF Jojo's pop's was in?! The very same.George was the first to uncover his true identity after hearing about Dio's stories from both Straits and I.But George was just a simple John Smith! He had the talent and aptitude for learning the Art of Mystics, but he never had any formal training! Before he could attain any evidence of the Wing Commander's identity, that damned vampire had already spotted him! And before he could call and inform Straits Officially, George d*ed after his plane crashed during a routine night-flight.Both Straits and I conducted our own investigation for the true cause of death, and we learned of his Wing Commander.The night I told Elisabeth the truth was the last night she'd ever cradle her beloved baby-boy.Rather than weep over my report, she immediately left the Estate! Elisabeth was a Ripple Master! However, she was vengeful and without restraint! The Wing Commander's subordinate witnessed her m*rder him! The RAF knew nothing about the Art of Mystics or vampires.All they knew was that one of their exceptional Wing Commanders was k*lled by a "wicked woman" who had set fire to his body after the m*rder! An enemy of the state, Elisabeth would be wanted worldwide for the infamy of murdering a RAF Wing Commander! My Foundation did everything in its power to erase any trace she'd left, and Elisabeth entered exile without a word.Without even a word to her beloved baby-boy.Miss Erina spoke a somber request to me after Elisabeth's exile.If Joseph ever asks about his parents whereabouts, tell him that they both passed away.Let him be spared from it all.And thus, Elisabeth became "Lisa Lisa." Why Why not tell him?! What bad could come from knowing that his mom's still around?! I felt her pain! The very pain Miss Erina felt after losing both her husband and son to the Mystic's crusade against the accursed Stone Mask! That is why she wanted her one and only grandson, Joseph Joestar, to never learn the Art which cost her both her husband and son! That is exactly what Lisa Lisa wanted as well! I feel for this family This unfortunate family! But Jojo Jojo just saved his own mother with that very same Art! Mister Speedwagon There ain't no reason left to hide the truth no more, right? He needs to know that he saved his own mother with the Art of Mystics! True But it's not our decision to make! We'll have to run it by both Miss Erina and Lisa Lisa, first! C'mon SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, the cannon is ready! Good! Put him between the crosshairs! The Third Reich shall be responsible for k*lling Cars! Jawohl! Here comes the countdown, Cars! The countdown to your very doom! Stop, Stroheim! He's wearing the Stone Mask! And the Ultimate Aja's embedded within! Don't shine it on him! M-Mein Gott! Shut it down! Shut the Ultra-Uber down, now!

I'm trying to cook up another scheme during my sprint, so keep your screams silent! Jojo! He's lured Cars away from the rest of us! But we're all doomed! No matter how sweet a scheme you cook up, Cars shall never succumb to any succulence now! Cars is coming! Run for it! Say, Smokey! I'm grateful for your company and all, but just in case you didn't catch Cars's chatter, he's only after my head, and mine alone! You don't have to run alongside me, okay?!

Believe it or not, she's really your! Dammit! He's caught up to us! Herr Speedwagon Is that truly the True Omnipotent Organism? Yes! By adorning the True Stone Mask, he's attained the Attributes of Omnipotence! The "Attributes of Omnipotence" consist of: Invincibility, eternal life, invulnerability to Death, and possessing the powers of all living organisms, which have far-surpassed that of the original species! He who attains the Attributes of Omnipotence is granted a body on par with the most gorgeous of Grecian sculptures! H-He can't be k*lled by anything anymore!

I'll hear you out another time! Jojo!!! Swimming away, eh? My plane versus your plumes, Cars! That's a wing of the Luftwaffe! Jojo! The plumes Cars pitched became as dense as the carapace of armadillos, which effectively deflected all fire due to the coat of oil on each plume! However, the denseness and deflective properties came second to the offensive efficacy of which these plumes were purposed! That prick's plumes are piercing projectiles! I've lost altitude! But I was never gonna stay, so I'll still skedaddle away! Jojo! Alls Jojo can do now is fly from him! That's it! Fly and flee, Jojo! That's the only lesson humanity can take away from this catastrophe!

Respond, Jojo! I'm still here, over.Say, Great-Uncle No wizardry or weaponry known to man can k*ll Cars now, right? He's indubitably indestructible, right? Indeed! That's why your backup plan of escape really is the best plan available to you! Great-Uncle I've got a new scheme up my sleeve.Scheme?! No, Jojo! No more schemes! Skedaddling is the only damn scheme you have left! Now is the only chance I'll ever have to k*ll Cars! No! Stop trying to take matters into your own hands, goddammit! Just listen up, Great-Uncle!

01x26 - The Man Who Became GodQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/08/23 07:58Eons ago, an omnipotent organism yearned to learn the meaning of "true omnipotence." He could soar amongst the birds, and reside within the watery depths of the sea.His energies stemmed from the very Earth that bore him, and he moved with the swiftness of water.But this organism could not run under the Sun, which is why he created the Stone Mask.With it, he dreamt of the day when he could embrace those radiant rays, and rule absolute over the Earth.Episode A God Amongst Men But has Cars Has Cars been cast into the magma chamber?! C-Curse you! He has! M-My armor Needs to be as concrete as a crustacean's! I-I shall adorn my armor! I-It melts! It's melting straight through his armor! That magma's over 1000Â°C! And I hope your corpse undergoes a thorough cooking, Cars! Autsch! H-He's dead! Finally We've finally k*lled Cars! Jojo, that expl*si*n's set off a chain reaction for an eruption! You can celebrate all you want after we're off this rock! Grab ahold of me, my good Jerry.A sweet scream A very sweet scream, indeed.In fact, it's the very scream I've been waiting eons to hear, Jojo! Cars? How is he still?! Cars's armor? Incredible It's composed from At first, Cars attempted to adapt a crustacean's carapace, but no organic armor can withstand magma! As a result, the molten-hot magma melted his armor away.However, his secret, secondary defense compensated for his melted armor! His secondary defense consisted of a bubble barrier! By expelling bubbles, Body Air Magma Cars cooled the magma surrounding his body, which created a barrier of air! While that air barrier only momentarily neutralizes the magma, Cars can continuously counteract and cool the magma with his bubbles in order to continue any activity within the magma chamber! All life was borne from the crust of the Earth, but at long last, Cars the Creator has conquered the very lifeblood of the Earth! Eons ago, before the emergence of the h*m* sapiens species, an evolved hominid species had dominated the Earth.This hominid species was strictly nocturnal, as they would perish under the shine of sunlight.For this reason, they we're forced to live underground.Even without the aid of daylight, their longevity could be prolonged by hunting other organisms.When the Neanderthal species emerged, they worshipped their nocturnal counterparts either as gods or devils.The nocturnal hominids were often impervious to Death, which made reproduction a rather rare event.As a result, their population was quite limited.But their practices allowed for the establishment of a peaceful community.However a cunning outcast was created from this very community.There are prodigious powers still concealed within this shell of mine.I shall unseal these concealed powers! The cunning outcast created the Stone Mask.His creation coaxed forth his imperishable powers, but necessitated nourishment far greater than the norm.Nourishment which would leave the presence of other organisms scant.His creation would surely diminish the wildlife required for the community's survival.As a result, the community became fearful of the Stone Mask.They were fearful of the cunning outcast.His continuance shall bring about calamity! His existence must be eradicated from the Earth! k*ll the Cunning Outcast! Hear me, imbeciles! Do you not dream to walk under the daylight?! Have you no ambition to stand omnipotent over all others?! Who would dare to not triumph over Terror, itself?! Death to the Doomed.The Cunning Outcast exterminated his entire community, including the very parents who bore him.He adopted a child he had personally orphaned, and together with his compatible contemporary, left on an ambitious adventure.An adventure, which would have him hunting for a way to attain "true omnipotence." 10,000 years later, the Cunning Outcast would finally attain "true omnipotence." He is a god He is a true god! He is a god amongst men, and men cannot k*ll a god! We can only submit to his omnipotence! Come again? Sorry Jojo, but you'll have to speak up.Ripple of Repulsion! "Rip-ple?" Ripple this! Jojo! It can't be! M-Melting?! But how?! How's me leg melting?! Melting?! That could only mean that I may utilize the Ripple! You simpleton! Now that I've vanquished my vulnerabilities, I too may utilize the Art of Mystics, you incompetent "arsehole!" Th-That's impossible! From your wound, it would appear that my potency overpowers yours by a several hundred times! His powers are a several hundred times more potent?! Then it's like being struck by the Sun itself! And the Sun would easily melt away and vaporize anything, even flesh! Hurts, doesn't it? How do you like being on the receiving end? Ecstatic, from the sound of your screams.And your screams beckon me to silence you.Jojo! I'm done for Cars is coming in for the k*ll.Jojo didn't try to break from that belief.He was without fear, without pain, and without any regret, because he thought that he did all that he could do.Cars the Creator met the cold eyes of a man who lay before him, who was calmly awaiting his impending death.Stroheim shared Jojo's beliefs.Paralyzed and static from shock, he understood how a frog felt before falling prey to a python.This is the Art of Mystics My Mystic Meddler, this ceremony shall end with my ascension into Omnipotence after I've channeled Ripple energy into you! Rip-ple Potency that is far-beyond my own Melt away into the oblivion of that magma chamber! Channel it, will you?! What's this?! The Ultimate Aja?! What's this?! The Ultimate Aja?! The Ultimate Aja! At that moment, not even Jojo realized why he attempted to block Cars with the Ultimate Aja.Unconsciously, he felt an attraction between the hand holding the Ultimate Aja and Cars's Ripple.But subconsciously, Jojo's body knew the truth! Subconsciously, his body was fighting for survival! Jojo's subconsciousness empowered his survival instincts with a great shove! Th-The Ultimate Aja's actually a Ripple amplification apparatus! With that amplification of Cars's Ripple energy, the volcano's eruption occurred within an instant, and breached the bedrock! Th-That eruption blasted them both and the bedrock sky-high! Th-This is a pressure I've never experienced! But did you honestly believe that I'd let the eruption blast me away, Jojo?! I shall take to my wings to avoid entering the atmosphere! Aeternum vale, Jojo! Thank God for Gaia's Grace! The eruption blasted my bloody arm all the way up here! And now you'll ask, "Was this all a part of your plan, Jojo?!" Was this all a part-! It was at this very moment, when Cars was caught off guard by Jojo's severed arm, which would determine his doom! The volcanic ash that Cars could've avoided had struck their target, propelling him beyond the troposphere! Was this all a part of your plan, Jojo?! You bet your arse it was! I've got a plan, a scheme, a trick for every smelly pickle in the pocket! Boy, can I bluff But at least I can finally have the last laugh! Volcanic ash from the eruption blasted far-beyond the troposphere and well into the stratosphere, but even Cars couldn't be k*lled by an eruption from the Earth! However, that eruption expelled Cars beyond Earth's atmosphere and straight into outer space! Stars?! I-It cannot be! It's finally finished Nanna Erina Stroheim Great-Uncle Speedwagon Smokey and Lisa Lisa I'm out, everybody Jo JOJO!!! Eight hours later, after Stroheim was rescued from Vulcano Isle, he had only this to say to Speedwagon.February 28, 1939 An eruption off of Vulcano Isle ended Joseph Joestar's life.I've entered outer space?! If I can expel the all the steam from my abdomen in order to reverse my trajectory, I can re-enter Earth's atmosphere! I-I've failed! I-I'm freezing! O-Oxygen is being sapped from my body! The deeper into space I drift, the quicker the oxygen deprivation! I-I can't fly back! I CANNOT RETURN! Cars would never return to Planet Earth.He became an amalgamation of inorganic and organic matter, and drifted aimlessly throughout the galaxy.To the undying Creator, Death was all that he dreamt of, until one day, when every transient node in Cars's cranium ceased to function.New York City Outskirts April 1939 Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.Your kingdom come, your will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven.Goodbye, Jojo Come to think of it, we've only know each other for 'bout half-a-year.But I'll never forget you 'Til the day I die Never.Miss Erina, I think it's time we went on our way.Let us be off.Let me be Guess who?

The craft was largely undamagedand showed no signs of struggle.   In the galley, three cups of coffeesat half-full.   And...   on deck, an iron chest,its lock melted away,   lay open and empty.   But the chest's unusual,shelter-like chambers   baffled discoverers,   who believed it to haveonce contained a vast treasure.   But interest waned and,   before long, the chest was forgotten.   Jotaro Kujo,    years old,    centimeters tall.   His father, a Japanese nationaland jazz musician,    on tour abroad.    His mother,an American of British descent.   There's no mistake, Jotaro is my son.   His friends at school call him "Jojo."   Seems they combined "Jo"from Jotaro and "jo" from Kujo.   What a stupid name!   So...   How many people has my Jotaro k*lled?   No! Don't say it!    -I don't want to know!-Uh, who said he k*lled anybody?   He was in a fight.    Yep, four punks with nunchucksand knives,   one of whom was a former boxer.   Your son left them withfifteen broken bones.   He really busted their nuts...   I mean, pardon me...he put them in the hospital.   Ma'am, it's your responsibilitythat he learns his lesson!   Yes sir!    But the problem is what happened after.    Here, make some copies and pass it around.   Right away, sir.   He's a strange one, isn't he?   Please, come this way.   Thank you.   Here, it's time to take him home.   Oh, he's already free to go?   Well, we can't keep him forever.    By the way, ma'am,your Japanese is very good.    How long have you lived here?   Twenty years.   No wonder.   Good work, gentlemen.   We've had our hands full lately.   There's even a waiting list for cells.   Your son is just up ahead.   Jotaro!   Jotaro, throw the ball to Mommy!   That's it!   You'll do great at tomorrow's track meet.   Yeah!   Jotaro...   Let's celebrate.What do you want to eat today?   Anything, as long as you're cooking, Mom.   Jotaro...   Jotaro...   Jotaro!   Shut up!   You're freakin annoying, bitch!   Okay!    He's actually a very sweet boy.    He could never do something so terrible.   Hey, Kujo! Rise and shine!   You're free to go. Now get out!   Hey, I said you're free to go!What the hell's wrong with you?   Mom, go home.   I'm gonna be here a while.   I'm being haunted by an evil spirit.   Who knows what he'll make me do next.   It took all I had   to keep this thing in checkduring that fight.   That's why you can'tlet me out of this cell.    For crying out loud...See what I'm talking about, ma'am?    We tell him he can leave, but he refuses.    Forgive my asking,but is your son all right up there?    This isn't a hotel!    Please! Move us to another cell!    He's telling the truth!    -He's got something evil in him!-It's horrible!    I won't commit another crime ever again!    All right, that's enough!    What the hell's that?    But you're behind bars!How'd you get that in here?    I told you.    It's the evil spirit.    The evil spirit brings things to me.    He's still in! He's in! He's in!    He's listening to a boombox    and reading Shonen Jump!    How? This is bad!    -What are we gonna do?-Hold it!    If you still think you can release me,    let me show you how bad things could get,    so you'll have no doubt thatletting me free is a very bad idea.    My g*n!    -How?-We've got trouble!    You didn't see it, did you?My evil spirit...    In that case...    Jotaro!    There's someone behind me.    Not that long ago, it stuck itself to me.    His grandpa, Joseph,has mysterious powers too...    What's happening to my son?    JOTARO KUJO    Dad!    Over here, Dad! Over here!    Holly! Hey, outta my way!    Dad!    Dad!    I'm so glad you're here!    My one and only daughter in trouble?    Give me twenty-four hoursand I'll cross the globe!    Where's Mom?    She made a fuss, not surprisingly...    So I told her I had a littleJoestar Realty to attend to.    Dad...    Holly...    All right, Holly! You can let go now!    No!    It's been forever since you've held me!    Come on...    You're a forty-five-year-old woman!    Oh, now you've done it!I'm going to tickle you!    -Tickle, tickle, tickle...-Hey! Stop that!    Take that and that!    What the hell are you looking at?    -Mama...-Don't look!    I'll take your bag.    By the way, Holly, about Jotaro...    You said it was an evil spirit?    Oh... My poor Jotaro!    I saw it! The policemen couldn't,but I could.    Another arm...    And it grabbed the g*n!    So no one else could see it but you?    Yes...    Jotaro says this spiritcame upon him not long ago.    Has anything strange happened to you?    No, not in the slightest.    Jotaro says he won't leave the celluntil he knows what's going on.    Oh Dad, what are we gonna do?    There, there, sweetheart.    Everything will be just fine.Joseph Joestar is here.    Right.    First, I need to see him...    my grandson, Jotaro!    Too creepy!    He keeps getting more stuff...    And he's violent.    Something heinous is haunting him...    If word of this ever gets out,I'll get canned!    Don't worry.    I'll be taking my grandson home.    "Grandson"?    Hey, what are you doing?    I told you, this is as far as you can go!    -Talk to him from here!-I'll take care of it.    -It's dangerous!-Step aside!    -I can't be held responsible if you...-Leave him to me.    -You...-Come now, you're in the way.    Jotaro! It's grandpa!    He can help!    Just come out with Grandpa.    Come out. We're going home.    Get lost.    I didn't ask for you.    You'll "help"? What can you do for me?    Sorry you came all the way from New York,    but you can't help me, Grandpa.    My prosthetic hand's left pinky!    When did he do that?    Did you catch that? Didn't notice?    That's the evil spirit.    Stay back.    Or you'll lose what little lifeyou have left.    Incredible! I don't believe it...    He was able to pull somethinglike that on me right off the bat...    Of course... I know all aboutJotaro's evil spirit.    But I think experiencerather than explanation    will truly drive the point homefor young Jotaro.    No, he has to learn now    so he'll be ready for whateverdanger he encounters later.    Avdol, your turn.    Say hello to my friend.We met in Egypt three years ago.    His name is Avdol.    Please assist my grandsonout of this cell.    Back off.    Sure, you look tough, but do youreally think I'm the kind of guy    who would take kindlyto a thr*at like that?    Nope, all that does is    make me even more determinedto stay exactly where I belong.    I regret that thingsmay get a bit unpleasant,    enough to where he will want toleave out of his own volition.    That's fine.    Dad, what are you doing?    Hey, we can't have you...    Quiet.    -Yes, sir!-Yes, sir!    That's...    That's right.    Avdol also haswhat you call an "evil spirit."    An evil spirit that Avdolcan control freely!    And its name is...    Magician's Red!    It's hot! Fire! My arm! My arm's burning!    What is this evil spirit?    Kujo's stuck to the wall and can't move.    But how...    But isn't it getting sort of...    How is it that hot?    That's insane! It's way too hot!    So, it's finally shown itself!    And he's so clearly visible. What power.    Why you...    To think he'd be able to manifestits form so clearly!    So you too have an evil spirit.    And Grandpa, you know what it is...    I do.    Mr. Joestar, you asked meto bring out your grandson.    It was my intention to hold back,but with his startling power,    one wrong move and he may end my life.    Shall I stop?    If you prefer that I continue,    I may have to resort toconsiderable force.    And I may end up sendingyour grandson to the hospital.    Fine by me. Give it a whirl.    Yes, sir!    Red Bind!    This is...    It's so hot!    What the hell is happening?    Dad! What are you doing to Jotaro?    Holly, be a good girl and stay quiet.    'Kay?    I can't breathe...    The spirit's going back inside him.    As the heat consumes your breath,it weakens.    Allow me to tell you what it is!    It is an evil spirit, and yet is not.    Jotaro! What you call an evil spirit    is a powerful apparition,created from your own life energy.    What stands next to you, is...    A Stand!    A Stand?    As the famous Aesop fable goes,    the traveler who pulls his cloaktightly in the chill of the wind,    releases it under the heat of the sun.    Care to come out, Jojo?    Whatever.    I'll stay put until I knowI'm not a danger to others.    It's nice to meeta fellow evil-spirit wielder,    but, you know, if you keep this up,    you die.    He destroyed the toilet!    That's destruction of property!    I warned you.    Bastard!    Don't say I didn't warn you!    Hey!    Don't turn your back on me?    Look at me!    Mr. Joestar.    As you can see, he has left his cell.    So...    you got me, eh?    Not exactly.    I had planned to send you to the hospital.    You were more powerfulthan I had expected.    What if I hadn't stoppedmy evil spirit from throwing    this iron bar straight through you?    My Stand is Magician's Red.    It can melt such steel in mid air.    Avdol is just like you.    Proof enough that youneed not study your evil spirit    here in prison any longer.     MAGICIAN'S REDMOHAMMED AVDOL    Oh, thank goodness.    Jotaro finally came out of his cell.    God you're annoying, you bitch.    Okay!    Hey!    How dare you addressyour own mother that way?    And Holly, stop grinning at the boy!    Okay!    Grandpa! Tell me one thing...    Just one thing...    How do you know all this?    Why do you know aboutmy evil spirit, I mean, Stand?    I don't get it.    Of course.    That's why I made the tripfrom New York, after all.    I need to start from the beginning.    This has to do with the Joestar family.    First, take a look at these pictures.    What is this?    That's a hundred-year-old coffinpulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,    off the African coast four years ago.    Coffin?    I did my research, and foundit was on the passenger ship    where my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar,    your great-great grandfather, was k*lled.    Apparently it was emptywhen they discovered it.    But I know what lay inside!    Avdol and I are trying tolocate him as we speak.    Him? Hold on...    You make it sound like it's a person.    Why would you call something    that's been at the bottom ofthe sea for a hundred years "him"?    He's evil incarnate!    And his name is Dio!    Awakened after a century of sleep.    And it's our destiny to fight this man!    Hey, Jotaro?    That face you're makingmakes me think I'm boring you!    This face means that stupid storymakes me speechless, Gramps.    Gramps?    You're Avdol, right?    I don't know who you think you are,    but I can tell you are a pompous prick.    And Old Man, you expect meto listen to that crazy story    and just accept it?    Is it any less believable    than the evil spirits you and I have?    Fair enough.    You'll have to believe us soon enough.    Once you understand how I know Dio,    and why I must pursue him...    Allow me to demonstrate.    It turns out that I too    gained my own "evil spirit"or Stand about a year ago.    What?    What, Old Man?    Let me show you!    This is...    my Stand!    Did you see it?    The thorns from my hand? That is my Stand!    It can reveal far-away visionsand print them on film!    Unfortunately,I've gotta bust a   ,    yen camera    every time I use it!    Sir, is something wrong?    We're fine. Go away.    Right...    The image that's about toappear on this photo,    Jotaro...    will define your very destiny!    What?    Jotaro, Holly, have you twoever taken a close look    at the back of your necks?    What are you talking about?    You've probably never noticed.    On the back of my neckis a mark like a star.    What the hell does all this mean?    According to my mother,my father had it too.    He d*ed when I was young.    Seems all those withJoestar blood have this mark.    So, Old Man,what's gonna show up on that photo.    The star that escaped your noticeis our destiny!    -Dad...-Don't mess with me!    Show me the damn photo!    Dio!    My spirit photography bareshis image every time!    Take a look at the back of his neck!    Below this bastard scum's neck,    is the body of my grandfather,Jonathan Joestar!    One hundred years ago, a mysteriousincident unfolded on the Atlantic.    From what Granny Erina told meabout my grandfather's death,    Dio must have survived by taking his body!     But one thing's for certain:     He's hiding somewhere, plotting something!    It's been four years since he was revived.    My spirit photography, your evil spirit,     have all appeared within this past year...     It has to be Dio!     "Normal" people would deemour abilities as supernatural.    I've had this Stand since birth.     But yours and your grandfather's abilities     share an invisible link with Dio,Jonathan's body.    Undoubtedly, Dio has awakenedyour dormant abilities.     Avdol, where is he?Can you tell from the photo?     I cannot.The background is barely visible.    As I thought.    I will examine this.    Please.    Oh, Holly.    Forgive Daddy for all the scary talk.    Now, let's go home.    Yes...    We'll be staying in Japan for a while.    Thank you for putting us up.     Of course, Dad.     Let's go, Jotaro.    Again...    Just now, it felt as thoughsomeone was watching me.    It has to be Jonathan's descendants...    This body is sending some kind ofsignal to his offspring.    Very well. It must be fate...    A fate that must be annihilated,a destiny that must be erased.    My intervention begins now.    Jotaro!    Here, a goodbye kiss.    -You bitch...-I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.    I just transferred here yesterday.    Does this look like a pen to you?    The loser is the evil one.    The one who'll be the judge is...
02x02 - Who Will Be the Judge!?QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:24Previously on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Come out. We're going home.  Get lost.  I didn't ask for you.  You'll "help"?  Say hello to my friend.We met in Egypt three years ago.  His name is Avdol.  Red Bind!  This is...   Allow me to tell you what it is!   It is an evil spirit, yet it is not.   Jotaro! What you call an evil spirit   is a powerful apparition,created from your own life energy.   What stands next to you, is...   a Stand!   That's a hundred-year-old coffinpulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,   off the African coast four years ago.   Coffin?

You forgot something!   Goodness...   Here, a goodbye kiss.   Smooch.   Annoying bitch...   Quit being so freakin clingy, will ya?   Okay! Have a good day!   Good grief...   Hey, it's Jojo.   What? Jojo?   You're right! It's Jojo!   -Jojo!-Jojo!   Good morning, Jojo.   -Jojo!-Good morning, Jojo.   Jojo, what were you doingtaking four days off from school?   Hey!   Just what do you think you're doing?   He doesn't like you like that! Back off!   What's your problem, ugly?   Shut up, no-boobs.   -Ugly.-No-boobs.   Shut up! You're pissing me off!   He actually spoke to me!   No, he spoke to me!   Jojo, wait!   Wait for us!   -Jojo!-Jojo!   What?   -Jojo!-Jojo!   The branches...   Jojo!   Oh, no!   Jojo fell down the steps!   Oh, but he's still moving!   Thank God the branches broke his fall!   Did a branch just slice open my knee?   No...   It was there before the fall!   That's why I missed the step. I know it.   But...   Jojo!   Are you all right?   Oh?   I see his Stand has great power.   No wonder...   the Master wants him dead.   No matter...   He is no match for my Stand.    EPISODE TWO:WHO WILL BE THE JUDGE?    You really scared me.    -Are you okay, Jojo?-Are you okay, Jojo?   That was lucky.   Fifteen centimeters more,and you'd have hit the pavement.   People slip on these steps all the time.   From now on, we'd betterhold hands going down, Jojo.   You...   Your left leg appears to be bleeding.   Here, you can use this handkerchiefto clean yourself up.   Are you all right?   I'll be just fine.   Hold it.   Thanks.   I don't recognize you.Do you go to this school?   Noriaki Kakyoin.   I just transferred here yesterday.   Nice to meet you.    -Huh...-Huh…    So he's Kakyoin, huh? He's kinda cute.    Really?    I like Jojo more.    -Me, too.-Me, too.    -What?-What are you talking about?    -Give it up.-I'm the best for Jojo.    Back then, I was weak...    I had no body.    If I hadn't stolen Jonathan Joestar's...    If it hadn't been for his energy,negligiable as it was,    I couldn't have survived that century    at the bottom of the sea.    But this body is an expression ofthe bond between parent and child.    It seems to tie me toJonathan's descendants.    They know of my presence.    Jonathan's body has given mea new power...    The Stand!    It reaches out tothe flesh of his progeny.    Alas, with it come advantagesand disadvantages.    They are two sides ofthe same coin. Such is life.    I must eliminate them...    The Joestar clan must be exterminated.    Damnit, this room is so cramped!    This is why I hate Japan.    Avdol, how can you stand this?    I find it quite fascinating...    the "Way of Tea."    "Way of Tea", my ass.    Instant coffee will do just fine!    Speaking of Dio...    Mr. Joestar, as long aswe can sense his existence,    we must assume he can sense ours.    Indeed.    But if we don't know his next move,or even what his powers may be...    Japanese coffee is awful!    It's from America.    Jojo, how did you get that cut?    Don't tell me. You got intoanother fight, didn't you?    And take off that hat!    It's rude!    For pity's sake...    Come on Doc, has Jojoever gotten hurt in a fight?    Yeah, think about it.    Yeah!    I suppose you're right.    Okay, I'll believe you fell down,your grace.    Hey, hold on.    What are you going to do?    I'm going to cut off your pants.    Quit joking around.    Well, I can't treat you otherwise.    I'll take them off.    You'll ruin a perfectly goodpair of paints.    Who knew you were such a cheapskate.    And while Jojo does that,    I'll take your temperaturesso I can prove you're faking.    No, we've got colds.    Let us go home early.    Nope!    Whoops.    What is this?     JOTARO KUJO, TODAY, YOU DIE AT THE HANDOF MY STAND! NORIAKI KAKYOIN    Kakyoin?    Hey... Doctor!    What are you doing?    Can't you see?    I'm shaking out thermometer for you.    Thermometer? Doc...    Doc, that's a pen!    A pen? A pen you say?    Does this look like a pen to you?    What imbeciles you boys are!    You actually thinkthis thermometer is a pen?    Why don't you take...    a closer...    look!    She's...    NORIAKI KAKYOIN    My eye! My eye!    Jojo...    You aren't going to tell me    this looks like a pen, too, are you?    This upper body strength...    She's no ordinary nurse.    I saw something weirdcrawl up from the floor.    Was it a Stand?    Noriaki Kakyoin...    Did he cut my leg on the stairs, too?    Bingo.    You're...    So we meet again.    I've attached my Stand to the doctor.    She is under my control now.    att*ck my Stand,and you'll injure her, Jojo.    You bastard... Who the hell are you?    I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.    My Stand's name is Hierophant Green.    And while I am human,I pledged my loyalty to him...    Which is why...    I have to k*ll you!    I'm not letting you harm her.    Now that I've dragged it out... I see…    it's nothing more thana pathetic parasite.    Kakyoin, this your Stand?    Kinda reminds me ofa fat, shiny, green melon.    You're going to regretdragging that out of her, Jojo.    Cut the bravado.    From the looks of your forehead,    I'm about to smash    two melons at once.    For now, I'm gonna keepa grip on you for a bit.    I'll take you to the Old Man.    I'm sure he'll be pleased to meet you...    Besides, I'd like to know moreabout Dio myself.    What?    What's this green stuff drippingfrom his Stand's hands?    I already told you, Jojo...    You will regret this.    Get ready for my Stand,Hierophant Green's...    Enough foul play!    Emerald Splash!    What do you think?    Emerald Splash...    What you thought was green ooze,    is the destructive energyHierophant Green controls!    It pierced your Stand's chest.    So you must be bleeding internally.    You and that nurse...    What?    But how? I pulled the Stand out of her...    I told you...    Attacking Hierophant hurts her.    My Stand can travel farther than yours,    though it prefers closed-in spaces.    It particularly enjoys hiding from sight.    Pull it out, however,and you'll witness its wrath.    That's why it tore her throat to shreds.    It's your fault, Jojo!    You're responsible!    It's all because of you, Jojo!    This is your doing!    If you would have just let me k*ll you,    she would be perfectly fine now.    You're trying to stand up?    How sad...    You look like a sorry punching bag,    awaiting your next thrashing.    It's true: I, Jotaro Kujo,have been called a delinquent.    And it's true that I tend to b*atthe crap out my opponents.    Some are still in the hospital.    I've also put cocky teachersin their places,    so much so that some never come back.    And I make it a policyto stiff restaurants    that serve crappy, over-priced food.    But...    even a guy like me...    can spot evil when he see's it.    Evil is when you usethe weak for your own gain,    and then stomp on them when it's over.    And that's what you've done.    To a young lady, even!    Your Stand hides from its victimsand the law. But...    I will be your judge!    Evil?    You have it all wrong.    The loser is evil.    The victor is righteous.    Whoever survives to tell the tale!    The end justifies the means!    The loser is the evil one.    And now, the final blow!    What? The loser is the evil one?    Emerald Splash!    Well, in that case...    What?    Impossible!He deflected my Emerald Splash!    ...let's see just how evil you are!    The judge will be...    my Stand!    What power...    You caught me off guard back there.    I'm glad my Stand's strong,    but I get the sense it's growingmore and more savage by the day.    That was close.    A little tender loving care,and the Doc should be as good as new.    What was that? A gas expl*si*n?    It came from the nurse's office!    Everyone stay put!    They can take over from here.    I'm taking the day off.    This guy has some explaining to do.About Dio...     HIEROPHANT GREENNORIAKI KAKYOIN    At this very moment, my Jotaro mustbe thinking about me at school!    It must be that psychic connectionbetween mother and son.    It's not.    Jotaro!    What about school? And who is that?    He's covered in blood!    Did you...    Stay out of this.    Where's the Old Man?    And why does this househave to be so freakin big?    I think your grandfather'sin the tea room, with Avdol.    Oh, Jotaro...    You never want to talk to me anymore.    I...    worry about you so much.    But I can see right through you!    Deep down, you're a sweet boy.    -Hey.-Yes?    You're looking a little pale today.    You okay?    Yay! Fine, thank you!    I knew it.    It doesn't look good. It's too late.    We can't save him.    I give him a few days.    Jotaro, it's not your fault.    Look.    Do you know why he choseto obey Dio, even to k*ll?    The culprit...    is here!    The hell?    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    This isn't good at all... At this rate…    Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.    I don't really understand, either.    This is the one thing I feared most!    Tell me how we should deal with this!
02x03 - The Curse of DIOQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:24EPISODE THREE:THE CURSE OF DIO   It's too late.  We can't save him.  He has only a few days left.  Jotaro, this isn't your fault.  Behold.  The real reason this manswore loyalty to Dio,  and came here to k*ll you  lies before our eyes,   here!   What the... That wriggling pieceof flesh looks like a spider.   So that's why he became Dio's minion?   It is a "flesh bud,"made of Dio's own cells.   And it extends all the way tothe young man's brain.   This modest-sized flesh bud   exerts power over his entire psyche.   In other words, the flesh budfunctions to elicit emotion,   like an antenna that channels...   Dio's charisma!   The kind of charisma that drivesa man to follow a dictator,   to put his faith intoa nefarious cult leader.   This boy idolized Dio and sworehis loyalty to him in the process!   Dio uses his charisma,   his intoxicating charm,to overwhelm and control.   It's how he ordered Kakyoin to k*ll us.   So slice him open and pull it out.   The brain is too delicate.   If he so much as flinches,we'll cause irreparable damage.   Jojo.   You must listen to me now.About four months ago, in Cairo,   I too met Dio!   I am a fortune teller by trade,   and I had just returned to my shopin Khan Khalili when,   under a full moon,   I saw him...   standing quietly atop the stairsto my shop's second floor,   with eyes so cold it felt as ifhe was piercing my heart.   His hair looked like spun gold,   his skin, alabaster, almost transparent.   Most of all, he emanated a strange,almost inhuman sensuality.   I had heard about him fromMr. Joestar, so I knew at once.   It was was Dio, back fromthe depths of the Atlantic!   I've heard you have a unique ability,   something ordinary humans do not.   It would please me greatly   if you could grant mea small demonstration.   That's when the terror sunk in.   His words had managed to calm my soul.   They were imbued witha dangerous sweetness.   It was horrifying!   Come, Avdol...   I ran for my life.   I didn't dare fight him.   I was lucky.   Had Mr. Joestar not warned me,   had I not been able tojump out that window   and fall into a maze of familiar streets,   escaping with my life,   I would have ended up like this young man,   a pawn of Dio,dominated by another flesh bud.   And, like the boy,you'd have d*ed in a few years,   your brain devoured.   d*ed?   Not so fast.   Kakyoin's...   still alive!   I'll pull that thing out with my Stand!   Wait, Jotaro!   Back off, old man!   I'll pull it out fast,with no damage to his brain.   My Stand has the speed and accuracyto grab a b*llet mid-flight.   Don't! That flesh bud is alive!   There's a reason why part of itis outside the skin.   The same reason why evena skilled surgeon can't remove it!   -sh*t!-The flesh sh*t out a tentacle!   Curses! Let go of it, Jojo!   It'll infiltrate the brain ofanyone who tries to remove it!   You...   Stay still, Kakyoin.One mistake, and you're a dead man.   Let go now, Jojo! It's reached your face!   Wait, Avdol!   This is my grandsonwe're talking about here.   His body may be under siege,   but he'll remain cool as a cucumber.   He and his stand are solid as a rock!   He's more powerfuland precise than a machine!   He did it!   Overdrive!   Why?   Why did you risk your own life to save me?   Well...   Can't say I really know why myself.   Your mother seesright through you, Jotaro.   FIRST AID KIT   There ya go.   Thank you...very much.   Kakyoin, wasn't it?   I think you're overdue for some rest.   Why don't you stay with us tonight?    Papa, go get his futon ready.    Huh? Why me?    I've never even liked the ideaof sleeping on the floor!    Holly, get that futon out ofmy room and give me a real bed!    Papa, you're in Japan,    you should get accustomed tothe Japanese way of life.    Oh, and call me "Seiko."    What?    My friends here think my name is "Holy,"    so they call me "Seiko" for "holy child."    What in the hell?    "Holly" is the beautiful nameI gave my beautiful da...    From now on, I won't answerunless you call me "Seiko."    Holly!    Does it hurt, Kakyoin?    I'm fine.    Holly!    -Good grief...-All right...    Kakyoin, take off your uniform.    -Huh?-Come on, now.    Holly!    Hmph.    Holly! Hey, Holly.    Hey, where are you?    Look at these! These are Jotaro's pants!    Where are mine?    They fit fine, but look at them!I can't wear these!    Hey, Holly!    Oh, I'm supposed to call her "Seiko"    or she won't respond?    No, my daughter is Holly.Holly! Answer me!    This time I'm really gonna do it.I'm going to school.    Weird...    Here, a goodbye kiss.    Smooch.    That's usually how it plays out...    Ms...    Ms. Holly!    Ms. Holly!    She's burning up with a fever...    An illness?    No... It can't be!    Forgive me...    How can this be?    It's transparent...    It's a Stand!    Ms. Holly has gained a Stand as well!     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    Ms. Holly has a Stand, too.    But this high fever...The Stand is hurting her.    We were so relieved Dio's body    had only affected Jojo and Mr. Joestar!    We thought Ms. Hollyhad escaped unscathed,    but we were just deluding ourselves.    This was inevitable.    With Joestar blood in her veins,    Dio's influence is unescapable.    But...    a Stand is guided byits user's fighting spirit.    A Stand is called to actionby one's battle instinct.    The kind and gentle Ms. Hollyis helpless against Dio's curse.    She doesn't have the strengthto control her Stand.    Instead, her Stand is actingagainst her, crippling her!    This is an emergency. At this rate...    She'll die!    She'll be overcome!    A Stand...    Holly...    My worst fear has come true!    My girl, she has a Stand...    I knew she didn't havethe power to resist.    I knew she didn't havethe strength to deny Dio's soul.    Tell me! What can we do?    There's one thing.    We must find Dio!    We must k*ll Dio and break the curse!    That's our only option!    But...    no matter how many times I try,he's always hiding in the darkness.    The background is always dark!    My pictures never reveal his whereabouts!    We've used every means to no avail.    The darkness is impenetrable.    Well, why didn't you say so?    I have a feelingit might just be able to...    find the bastard!    Seems it found something behind Dio.    Don't forget, my Stand can    move accurately enough to removea flesh bud from the brain,    and catch b*ll*ts in mid-air.    Let's have it sketch what it sees.    A fly! A fly was in the photo!    But a fly can't help us!    Wait a moment!    -I know this species!-What?    Jojo, do you have an encyclopedia?    -The library's out back.-Give me the sketch.    I'll be back.    Holly!    Papa, I...    Just rest. Jotaro, water,get me some water.    You seem to have recovered.    My apologies, but I'm inthe middle of an investigation.    Is it really possible fora Stand to k*ll its own user?    It is.    I've witnessed the phenomenonseveral times.    At present,the Stand is confined to her back.    But in time,    that thorny-plant Stand will likelyovertake Ms. Holly's entire body.    She will develop a high feverand various illnesses,    before slipping into a coma,never to awaken again.    Then death.    No ordinary doctor can see what we can,    much less cure her...    No one, not you nor I, can heal her.    But there is still hope.    It will take fifty days forthe Stand to take its toll.    We must locate and destroy Diobefore time runs out!    If we can sever the linkbetween her Stand and Dio,    we can save her!    Thank you, Jotaro.    I don't know what happened.    I don't know how I suddenlydeveloped a fever and passed out.    But...    -I feel better now.-It's on her back,    so she has no idea.    You had us all worried, Holly.    Here. You've got to brushyour teeth when you get up.    -Say, "ahh."-Ahh...    Now wipe your face...    Your hair is a mess.    Now for your nails...    -Ahh...-Ahhh...    Come help me change my undies, Papa.    Just kidding! I was joking!    Now, then, what would you like    -for dinner, Jotaro?-Hey...    Freeze! Stay in bed!    I mean, you should take it easy    until that fever of yours dies down.    Just keep quiet and restuntil you're better.    Holly, come on...    You're right.    You're all so nice when I'm sick.    I guess a little coldonce in a while isn't so bad.    Holly!    She's passed out cold again.    She was acting fine, but she's burning up.    That confirms it.    She didn't say a word, but shenoticed the Stand on her back.    Just like her to try and hide it from us.    Holly never wants us to worry!    That's who she is.    Mr. Joestar, I've found it!    That fly is...    this.    The Nile Tsetse Fly.    Found only near the banks of the Nile,    the striped leg varietyis known as the Aswan Tsetse fly.    Egypt!    He must be in the Aswan region.    That's where we'll find Dio!    So he's in Egypt after all...    Kakyoin.    What do you mean?    It was three months ago    that he embedded the flesh budinto my brain.    I met Dio while traveling withmy family on the Nile in Egypt.    You were in Egypt, too?    It would seem Diowishes to remain in Egypt.    When do we leave?    I'll go with you.    With us? Why?    Who can say...    I can't say I knowthe answer to that myself.    Let's just say you've opened my eyes.    That's all.    Holly... We'll save you.    Just rest.    There's nothing for you to worry about...    We will make you better again.    Just you rest.    Jojo's mother, Ms. Holly...she's a calming soul.    She can put you at easejust by being near her.    This may sound strange,but if I ever fall in love,    I hope it will be with a woman like her.    I feel like I want to protect her.    I want to see her feeling better,to see her smile again.    Indeed.    Time's running out! It's time to go!    They're doctors fromthe Speedwagon Foundation.    We can trust them.    They will take care of Hollyaround the clock.    Jojo, before we leave...    I am a fortune teller.    Allow me to give your Stand its name.    Name?    With the Tarot, the cards of fate.    Draw a card, but do not look at it.    It will reveal your destiny,along with the power of your Stand.    Your card! It's the Star!    Your Stand shall be named...    Star Platinum!    Jotaro Kujo.    Stand name: Star Platinum!    Ability: Precision andextraordinary strength!    Joseph Joestar.    Stand name: Hermit Purple!    Ability: Spirit photography!    Mohammed Avdol.    Stand name: Magician's Red!    Ability: Flames and heat!    Noriaki Kakyoin.    Stand name: Hierophant Green!    Ability: Remote Stand manipulationand Emerald Splash!    All right, we're off.    Let's hit the road!    NARITABANGKOK    ABOU DHABIKUWAIT    CAIRO    As I thought...    They have detected my location.    Will you make it?    To Egypt?    Joseph and Jotaro...    He saw us.    I just felt Dio looking at us.    -Yeah.-Stay on your guard.    A new Stand usermay already be on this plane.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    We've already found the next Stand user!    Impossible!It's faster than Star Platinum!    What?    It writhes in pain when torn apart.    Wow... He's so handsome!    Pardon me.    Do you have a moment?
02x04 - Tower of GrayQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:25There is, of course, the feeling of fear.  It's a natural emotionfound in all animals.  What do you think causes fear?  There is the kind of fear bornof animal instinct,  and the kind of fearborn of a rational mind.  That is, one may perceive fear whenfacing a foe stronger than oneself  and realizing there isno way of fighting back,  or when encountering the unknown.  The sheer uncertainty can be terrifying.   If faced with such fear,   a person has a number of optionsfrom which to choose.   One might struggle,resist, flee, or accept.   But upon meeting Lord Dio,a new, unexpected reaction arises...   One feels joy!   How do people act   once they feel joy in fear?   Our friend is currently on the plane   Joestar and the others have boarded.   They will find it utterly impossible   to reach their final destinationin one piece.   A rhino beetle?   No...   It's a stag beetle!   Is it a Stand, Avdol?   Did Dio already send one of his men?   It's possible...   A Stand that takes the form of an insect.   It hid in the shadow of the seats...   Where did it go?   Jojo! It's right by your head!     It's huge! It has to be a Stand.   That insect is a Stand!   Disgusting...   But I'll take care of it.   Be careful.   I've been told there is an insectile Stand   that likes to rip outthe tongues of its victims.   Star Platinum!   It dodged!   I don't believe it!   It's faster than Star Platinum,   a Stand who has the speed andprecision to grab a flying b*llet.   So it has to be a Stand.That bug's a Stand!   Where is he? Where is he hiding?   But where can the user be hiding?   Here it comes!   sh*t!   Jotaro!   Just in the nick of time,   it stopped the bug's needlewith its teeth, but...   It's after Jotaro's Stand's tongue...   It's him!   The Tower card of the Tarot...   It symbolizes destruction and calamity,   and the interruption of journeys.This stand is called,   Tower of Gray.   Tower of Gray is responsiblefor mass murders,   which he makes look like accidents!   They say the plane crashin England last year   that claimed     lives is his handiwork.   I've heard rumors of this Stand user,   but not that he's joined Dio!   It dodged it.   And not just a single jab,but a two-fisted barrage of blows.   Its speed is incredible...   Even if you fired ten g*ns at mefrom one centimeter away,   not a single b*llet would touch my Stand!   Not that a g*n could harm a Stand...   He has to be nearby!   Who is it?   Who could be controlling it?   Which passengers is it?   If we just knew who it is...   It's gone again!   Over there now!   What's it trying to do?   No, it wouldn't!   Bingo!   Got their tongues!   And now for the best part...   m*ssacre!   Its definition: complete slaughter!   He actually did it...   I'll incinerate that bug alive!   Magician's Red!   Wait! Avdol, wait it's...   What's with all the ruckus...   Something happen...   Look out!   Might as well take a walk to the bathroom.   What's this slimy stuff?   M... A...   It's b-blood! Blood!   Atemi.   We have to defeat itbefore it causes panic   among the passengers.   But, Avdol,   a Stand like your Magician's Red    could cause the airplane to explode.    And Jojo,    we can't have Star Platinumtearing any holes in the fuselage.    It'd be a catastrophe.    This calls for    a quiet, more discreet Standlike Hierophant Green.    Noriaki Kakyoin, eh?    Dio has told me all about you.    Don't bother.    You think you havesilence on your side, but...    your Stand can't keep up with my speed.    Is that so?    Emerald Splash!    Emerald Splash!    Thought if you fire enough sh*tsyou'd get me, huh?    You haven't hit me at all!    Blast it! He's too fast!    Kakyoin!    You're just not quick enough!    No bingo for you!    And now, Kakyoin...    With this next att*ck,your Stand's tongue is mine!    My Tower Needle will punctureyour tongue and rip it out!    Emerald Splash!    Don't you get it?    No! It's still managing to dodgehis Emerald Splash!    Once my Stand rips outHierophant's tongue, you'll go mad...    from the pain!    S'that right?    Once Hierophant's tongue's ripped out,    I'll go mad from the pain?    My Hierophant Green...    What?    ...will go mad all right...    Once it rips you apart, it'll go mad...    from pure joy!    I had already extendedHierophant's extremities    into and under the seats.    My use of Emerald Splashto move you into position    must've slipped your notice.    So it was you all along.    Seems repulsive Standshave repulsive users.    It appears he wasn't implantedwith one of Dio's flesh buds...    Tower of Gray would k*ll travelers,and make it look like an accident...    all for pay.    He was bought, blinded by greed.    He was Dio's pawn.    Something's wrong.    Is it me, or is this plane flying crooked?    No, I'm right.    It can't be!    Sir, may I ask where you are going?    I'm afraid the cockpit isoff limits to passengers.    I know that.    Sir!    Oh! He's so handsome.    Move, bitch.    The shock!    Whoa, there.    Ignore that.    His disrespectful behavioris clearly incorrigible...    But this is an emergency.    Please forgive him.    Okay...    Dammit!    He got us!    Their tongues have been ripped out.    That beetle bastard...    The pilots never had a chance!    We're falling.    The autopilot's knocked out.    We're gonna crash!    What?    My Stand is The Tower card,    symbol of accidents andthe end of a journey.    You will never make it to Lord Dio!    Even if you survive this crash,    you'll still be   ,    kilometersfrom Egypt!    Those loyal to Lord Dio willfollow you every hour of every day!    The world is rank with Stands    more horrific than you could ever imagine.    Lord Dio is the master of Stands!    He has the power to reign over all.    There's no way you'll reach him!    You will never make it to Egypt!    You stewardesses are real pros.    You didn't let out a single shriek.    And I never had to lose my temper.    Now, listen up.    This old man's gonnaland this heap on the water.    Make sure our passengershave their life jackets    and seat belts ready.    Got it!    Old man.    Well...    I have driven a prop plane before, but...    Prop plane?    You know, Jotaro...this ismy third time in a plane crash.    Have you ever heard of someonebeing in a plane crash three times?    No way in hell...    No way in hell I'm everriding with you again.     TOWER OF GRAYGRAY FLY    The plane landed    kilometersoff the Hong Kong coast.    Jotaro and the others had no choice.They diverted to Hong Kong.    ...Thirty-five kilometers southof Hong Kong, near Lamma Island.    Efforts are underwayto rescue all passengers.    Hong Kong!    Hong Kong Island! Kowloon!The New Territories!    With more than     islands in the area,    Hong Kong and its breathtaking night scape    is known the world overas the "Million Dollar View."    Right. That's fine.    Please make sure the only onesaboard are us and the crew.    Right. We don't want any more victims.    Also...    Hey, big guy!    You guys aren't from around here are ya?    Want some rice porridge?    Can't come to Hong Kong and not tryour dim sum or rice porridge.    We have some hot cola, too.    Rice porridge, eh? Not bad.    Did you know, Jojo?    Unlike in Japan, rice porridgeis a staple in Hong Kong.    One bowl, the popular way,with pork and century egg.    Coming right up!    In that case I'll have—    Hey!    You boys think we have time to eat?    We're going to my old favorite.    Hey, dandy guy.    Want to try some Hong Kong hot cola?    Hot?    Everybody knows it's supposed to be cold.    Old man, who were you just calln?    Hm? Oh, I'll explain whenwe get to the restaurant.    We need to work out a planthat'll get us to Egypt    as safely and quickly as possible.    A plan?    Mr. Joestar,    we cannot allow any moreinnocent civilians to be hurt.    The quickest way would be by plane, but...    Indeed.    Traveling by plane to Egypt is nowcompletely out of the question.    If we encounter another Stand user    like the last one on a commercial flight,    we'll cause a disasterthat will harm many people.    We'll have to get to Egyptby either land or sea.    But if we fail to find Diowithin fifty days...    If we could've stayed on that plane,    we'd probably be in Cairo by now.    I'm well aware of that.    But it's to soon to panic.    A hundred years ago, Jules Vernewrote the novel,    Around the World in    Days.    That's a journey of   ,    kilometers.    And that was the era ofsteam engines and steamboats.    Even without a plane, in fifty days,    we can easily coverthe   ,    kilometers to Egypt.    As for the route...    I say we go by sea.    We can charter a decent-sized boat,    and circumvent the Malay Peninsula,to the Indian Ocean.    A Silk Road of the sea, as it were.    I too agree that is best.    Crossing boarders could bring trouble.    And we'd have to crossthe Himalayas and the desert.    We could lose a great deal of time.    The dangers are too many.    I haven't traveled tothose places using either route,    so I can't offer any advice.    I'll leave it up to you two.    Same.    Then it's decided.    The greatest danger that lies aheadis the Stand users sent by Dio.    The question is, how do we sneakinto Egypt undetected?    This is how you signal you want more tea.    In Hong Kong,place the teapot lid like this,    and they'll bring you some more.    When you've been poured your tea...    This means "thank you."    Pardon me. Sorry to bother.    I'm visiting from France,    and I'm having some difficultymaking sense of the menu.    Would you, perchance, be able totell me what these characters mean?    You're annoying. Get out of here.    Come now, Jotaro. Give him a break.    I've been to Hong Kong enoughto read a menu, at least.    Why don't you join us?    So, what sounds good?    How about some shrimp, duck, shark fin,    and something with mushrooms?    We'll have this, this, this...    And this, too.    Oh, and this.    This looks like beef, fish,clams, and frog, to me...    Indeed, this is quite differentfrom our order.    I knew this would happen.    Well, it doesn't matter.    It's all on me, boys!    Besides, it doesn't matter what you order.    It's all delicious!    All right, everyone, dig in.    Oh, this is...    See that? And you were worried.    Well, they've certainly takena lot of time to prepare this.    Take these carrots, for example...    Cut into perfect little stars.    In fact, they remind me of something...    I remember now.    Someone I know has a mark,    a birthmark just like thison the back of his neck...    You...    Are you another...    Mr. Joestar, look out!    It's a Stand!    Magician's Red!    What?    Another Stand user!    He has such speed with his sword...    My Stand is The Chariot card,and his name is...    Silver Chariot!    Mohammed Avdol,it appears you wish to die first.    I've carved a burning clockinto that table!    Before the clock strikes twelve,    you will be a dead man!    Would you like to be friends with me?    Something is bothering you.    Stick with me, and it'll disappearfrom your heart.    That left arm is not a right arm.    To think you're trying touse fortune-telling    to fight a fortune teller...
02x05 - Silver ChariotQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:27You have a way with a sword,  I'll grant you that.  So you think you can k*ll me  before the flames on that tablestrike twelve?  You seem to have quite the ego.  And you are...?  Polnareff.  Allow me to properly introduce myself.  That's Jean Pierre Polnareff.   Merci beaucoup.   My thanks for the introduction.   However...   Monsieur Polnareff,   you would be mistakenif you assume my flames   burn upward or with the wind.   I can control fire at will,thus the name "Magician's Red."   In the beginning, there was fire.   I should have expected as muchfrom Magician's Red,   the emblem of beginnings,the wielder of fire, of creation.   And yet, you speak of ego?   This swordsmanship of mine...   is this mere ego?!   In the moment they lined up,   he stabbed through all five coinsin a single strike!   No. Look closer.   That's...   I see... He's cut a flame for each coin.   So you comprehendthe significance of my moves.   I am no egoist.   My Stand can slice apart flames!   I can rip apart the atmosphere itself,   creating gaps between the layers of gases.   Which means your flames arepowerless before my Silver Chariot.   When did he...   My Stand...   The Chariot is the cardof victory and conquest.   I could dispose of youin this modest room, but...   is not your flame ability bettersuited to wide-open spaces, Avdol?   To destroy you at your best   is the only victory worthy of my Stand.   All of you, outside!     What is this place?   Tiger Balm Garden.   What?   Tiger Balm Garden,   a mysterious tableaulocated on the hillside of   Hong Kong's Tai Hang Road.   Its unique aesthetic and sense of style   make it one of Hong Kong'smost unusual sites.   Allow me to make a prediction...   First, Avdol,   you shall perish at the handof your own Stand.   Avdol...   Jotaro, I won't need your assistance.   In an expansive arena such as this,   I can manipulate my Stand to the full.   Come on!   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Come on. What's wrong?   Not going to spit those flames of yours?   If not, then I'll finish you right now!   Come on! Come on! Come on!   That bastard. He's mocking us.   While he was attacking,   he managed to carve a statueof Magician's Red.   Not bad...   You fit right in, Magician's Red.   Finally.   At last he reveals his true power...   Interesting...   Bring it.   Hey, we gotta hide!   We'll get torched if Avdol uses that.   "That"?   Crossfire Hurricane!   That all you've got?!   I told you my sword   can create gaps betweenthe layers of our atmosphere,   so I can slice your flames into bits!   Avdol!   His flames are so strong,they're burning him!   Just as I predicted.   You will die by your own flames!   Good grief!   One last pitiful att*ck?   How unsightly!   That's weird, that blow...   What?   Impossible!   I cut him in half, and out pour flames?   That's not his Stand.   It's a duplicate!   It seems the flames veiled your vision.   What you sliced apart   was the statue Silver Chariotcarved from before.   I told you, I can control flames at will.   The flames that it sent back toward it   melted its joints and caused it to move.    The one defeated byhis own Stand's ability was you!    Now, another chance to savor the heat...    Crossfire Hurricane!    I'm afraid you're ten years too young    to challenge a fortune tellerto a battle of prediction!    Such incredible power!    His Stand took that head-on,it must have melted. It's over!    With burns like that,    I'm guessing he's a goner.    He's lucky if he escapedwith just serious burns...    if you could call that luck.    If he lives,he'll be in bed for three months.    His Stand is destroyed.He's out of commission.    Now, Mr. Joestar,    I think it's time we geton our way to Egypt.    Indeed.    What?    His Stand is breaking apart!    He flew into the air while unconscious?!    Bravo! Oh, bravo!    He's...    I don't believe it!    He's completely unharmed!    How is he floating in mid air?    Look closely with your inner eye.    That's...    Yes, you see?    Behold, my Stand,Silver Chariot, armor-free!    You're speechless.    Well, I suppose it wouldn'tbe very chivalrous,    if I were to k*ll you allright here and now    without fully explaining my powers first.    Perhaps you will bekind enough to indulge me?    Very well.    Let us hear your explanation.    My Stand did not break apartand disappear.    Silver Chariot is equippedwith protective armor.    That is what it shed earlier.    Your flames b*rned awayonly part of its armor...    which is why I escapedwith only minor injuries.    And now that the armor is off,I'm light as a feather.    Were you able to catch a glimpseof my stand as it held me up?    That is how quickly it can move now!    I see...    The weight of your armor    made you vulnerableto my Crossfire Hurricane.    But, of course, you must know nowthat you're naked    and without protection.    The next hit will cost you your life.    Hmm...    Oui, perhaps.    Though I'd venture that's highly unlikely.    Unlikely? I'd like to test that theory.    First, allow me to show you something    that will surely boggle your mind.    By all means.    What?    He now has six...no, seven Stands!    Impossible.    A person can have only one Stand.    It seems you're sufficiently befuddled.    These are afterimages.    An entire army of Stand afterimagesto deceive your sight    and your hearing.    Your senses can't follow their movements.    How about this sword speed?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    Red Bind!    I told you you can't keep up.    Your flames grasp only afterimages.    Striking at random now?    You're getting a bit desperate, Avdol.    It's true;he'll end up exhausting himself.    Crossfire Hurricane!    Non.    That was just an image.    Your att*cks will not workagainst my Stand.    Come on, come on, come on!    Avdol!    Such precision. His...    Stand ability...it's been trained at length.    For nearly ten years, in fact...I have my reasons why.    Now, hurry up and att*ck.    I'd like to end this post haste.    I must say, to revealthe nature of your att*ck    is a rather noble deed.    Now allow me to do the same...to return the favor.    Oh?    This, as a matter of fact,    is a variation of my Crossfire Hurricane.    You'll recognize the Ankh shape,but the number differs.    I can divide it into multiple blasts.    Crossfire Hurricane    Special!    Dodge this!    You are a fool, Avdol!    His Stands assumed a circular formation!    He has no opening!    Naive! Naive, naive, naive, naive!    So naive!    I'll strike you down with your own power    just as I did before!    I'll slice the flames and throw them back!    What?    That's...    The hole he made earlier...    I get it!    That flame dug a tunnel,    a tunnel for his Crossfire Hurricane!    As I told you,    I can divide my flame andlaunch it as multiple att*cks.    Fire is an agonizing way to perish.    Take the dagger and end it.    I was conceited.    I never thought my swordsmanshipcould lose to fire.    I choose to perish slowly from my burns.    I owe at least that much respectto the man who has    to the man who hasso skillfully defeated me.    It would be cowardly to end it myself.    His sense of honorendures to the very end!    And he didn't use the daggerto att*ck me from behind!    His honor is too greatto yield to Dio's orders.    It would be a disservice to k*ll him.    There's a reason behind his actions...    Jojo!    Yeah.    Yuck! Those tentacles are disgusting!    Jotaro, hurry up and pull it out!    -Shut up, old man.-Come on!    There!    Now that the flesh bud is gone,we can be buddies.    Ta-da!    Kakyoin, don't people whomake stupid puns all the time    get on your nerves, or it just me?    The boat we chartered fromthe Speedwagon Foundation yesterday    should be at the harbor now.    What's wrong?    Something on your mind, Polnareff?    I never thanked you properly forfreeing me from Dio's mind control.    Don't thank me, thank Jojo.    I'm good.    It was a kind thought, but it seemsto have fallen on deaf ears.    As you wish. I've no desireto come off as heavy-handed.    But I'm not quite finished here.    Monsieur Joestar,    I hope you'll indulge my askinga very bizarre question.    Bizarre question?    It's none of my business,    but I noticed you never took offyour gloves, even while eating.    Your left hand wouldn't happento be a right hand, would it?    What? My left hand a right one?    You weren't kiddingabout the bizarre part.    What are you talking about?    I'm looking for the manwho m*rder*d my sister.    I don't know what he looks like.    But I do know he has two right hands.    It's a wound from fifty years ago...a badge of honor.    I apologize for being so rude.Please forgive me.    If it's not too painful,tell me what happened.    It was three years ago...    My little sister waswalking home from school    with a classmate one rainy day.    In our hometown...a smallcountryside village in France.    On the side of the road,a man stood with his back to them.    Strangely, in the middle of pouring rain,    as if surrounded bysome invisible membrane,    the rain fell in torrents around him.    Then suddenly,    her classmate's chest wassliced open, as if with a sickle.    And then...    He had his way with her and left her dead.    The man wanted nothing more.    Her friend escaped with her life...    to tell me the tale of that fateful day.    She never did see his face,    but saw that he had two right hands.    No one believed her, but I knew.    I knew that man had a power    not unlike that which I hadbeen hiding all these years.    He's a Stand user, all right.    I swore an oath!    I promised my sister's soulI would avenge her,    to hunt down that k*ller andmake him pay with his life!    And I would use my Standas a means of righteous vengeance!    Then, one year ago, I met Dio.    I see something in the crystal ball.    It's...    It is a vision.Not from my heart but from yours.    The man you seek, the pain you hide,    my power only brings it into focus.    How about it?    Why don't we become friends?    You are distressed. You are suffering.    Join me, and your sufferingwill soon be a thing of the past.    The image in the globeis what pains you, no?    Lend me your strength.    I too am suffering.    I have been deniedthe sun's embrace for all eternity.    That is why I need your strength.    Allow me to find him for you.    Then I was ordered to k*ll you all.    I felt it was the right thing to do.    The flesh bud is partially responsible,    but it seems he's quite the manipulator.    Indeed. And judging by that story,    I would wager that the manwith two right hands    is already his underling.    I've made up my mind!I want to travel with you to Egypt!    By going after Dio,    I'll find the onewho took my sister's life!    What do we do?    I've no objections.    Even if we told him no,he'd just follow along.    Jean Pierre Polnareff.    Stand name: Silver Chariot.    Ability:Fast and precise swordsmanship!    The honor is mine.    -Good grie...-Excuse me!    Would you mind taking our picture?    He's so cute.    What a great excuse to talk to him.    Thank you!    We want our backs toward the ocean.    Shut up already! Go bug someone else!    Now, now, now, now...    I'd be glad to take your picture.    Come, come.    You have very nice legs.    I'll be sure to get them in the sh*t.    Ooh, nice!    And another just in case.    Très bien!    If only...    I could take your heartinstead of your picture!    His personality is mystifying.    His emotions change on a dime.    More like he's got two brains,    and the one downstairssuddenly started calling the sh*ts.    Good grief.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    Can't you do something about that uniform?    Students should act like students.    Bring it on! I'll take you!    Was that a Stand user?    If a Stand user inhalesany cigarette smoke at all...    By the way...
02x06 - Dark Blue MoonQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:28Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Ms. Holly has gaineda Stand as well!  You will never make it to Lord Dio!  But if we fail to find Diowithin fifty days...  Someone I know has a mark,  a birthmark just like thison the back of his neck...  What?  I've made up my mind!I want to travel with you to Egypt!  By going after Dio,   I'll find the onewho took my sister's life!   The loathsome curse of Dio...   Even the Speedwagon Foundation'sleading physicians,   with their cutting-edge treatments,stand powerless before Dio's curse.   To save Holly,   Jojo and crew continueon their journey to Egypt.   With air travelnow too treacherous,   they board a boat,heading first to Singapore.   It'll take three full days at seato get from Hong Kong to Singapore.   Some peace and quietwill do us all good.   Hey, you two...   Why don't you switch outthose uniforms for something else?   You think you can keep upin those things?   Aren't you burning up?   Well, we are students...   And a good studentalways dresses the part...   Too much of a stretch?   Japanese studentsare such stiffs, aren't they?   I see...so this is what they call Bushido.   Like they say, clear your mind,and even flames feel cool.   That's all well and good,but that won't get you any girls.   Let go! Let go of me,you big jerk!   -Dammit, I said get off me! Let me go!-Shut your trap! Ya brat!   Hey, what's going on?   I thought we agreed there'd beno passengers onboard but us.   -Let go!-Sorry, sir. It's a stowaway.   Little brat was hiding inone of the storage holds below.   Stowaway?   Come at me, then!   I'll freakin break your balls!   Tell that to the coast guard,ya little sh*t.   Huh? The cops?   Please. Just let me go!   I just wanted to go to Singaporeto see my dad.   I'll do anything! You can evenput me to work for my ticket!   Let's see. What should I do?   Should I let you go?   -Or turn you in?-Please!   What to do?   -Ow!-No way I'm letting you go.   That'd be too easy.   But first, I'm gonna letthe Captain know.   Come wit...   Whoa! In he goes!That kid's got guts.   He's trying to swim to shore?   What should we do?   Forget 'em.   He wouldn't have jumped inif he wasn't a decent swimmer.   He's in trouble now!   These waters areinfested with sharks!   This isn't good!   Hey, kid! Come back!   Get back here! It's dangerous!   Sharks! There are sharks out there!   Huh?   Good grief, c'mon you brat.   You're...   A girl?   And a runty one, at that.   How dare youfeel me up like that?   Hands off!   Good grief.   Jotaro! Below you!   Something's coming after youfrom underwater!   It's not a shark!And it's racing towards you!   Jotaro!You have to get out of there now!   Hurry! Swim to the boat!   He's too far away.   That distance is no problem for me.   Hierophant Green!   It just disappeared!It's a Stand!   That thing is a Stand!   An aquatic Stand...   In all my dealings with the occult,I've never heard of such a thing!   This girl...There's no way she's the...   Could she be that Stand's user?   Did she try to lure Jojointo shark-infested water?   Geez, what's with you jerks?Quit staring at me like that!   I have no ideawhat's going on here,   but I'll fight you!   Don't underestimate me, okay?You're gonna regret this!   One-on-one!Come at me, I dare ya!   Ya punks!   She can't be serious.   Maybe we should toss her backinto the ocean.   Calm down.   If she is just a stowaway,the sharks will get her.   We've checked outall ten members of the crew.   She's the only one it could be.    Is there some waywe could be sure?    Hey, how's that devil Diodoing these days?    Dio? What the hell is that?    Don't pretend like you don't know,you little brat!    I warned you, punks!    You gonna be a man and talk to me,or do you just want to get shanked?    Which is it, huh?    My demon blade wants to slurpthe blood of its    th victim.    What's so funny, stupid jerk hole?    Jerk hole?    I'm starting to get the feelingshe's not our Stand user.    Yes, but who then...    This girl our stowaway?    Captain.    -I'm pretty strict-O-Ow...    -when it comes to stowaways.-Ow...    You may be a girl,but if I go easy on you,    we'll just getmore and more stowaways.    I think we'll lock you upin the brig below deck    until we make it to port.    Captain, I'd like toask you something.    You've verified the identities ofall ten of the men on board, right?    Of course.    They're all men who've workedwith me for over ten years.    Can't say I understand whythat is of prime importance.    By the way...    I must implore younot to smoke on deck.    What did you plan to dowith the ashes and butt?    Just toss them over the sideinto these pristine waters?    You may be a guest on this ship,    but you will abide by my rules,tough guy.    Got it?    Hold it, pops.    Then why didn't you just say so?    Don't be a condescending prickabout the whole thing, ya jackass.    Hey, Jotaro! Don't be disrespectfulto the captain!    You were in the wrong.    I'll be as rude as I want.    I figured it out.He's not the captain...    He's the Stand user!    What?    Sta...nd?    I'm not sure I follow...    That's inconceivable, Jotaro.    We chose Captain Dragonbecause he came recommended    with verificationby the Speedwagon Foundation.    He's someone we can trust.    He absolutely can't bea Stand user.    Hold on, a Stand?    I have no idea what you guysare talking about...    Jojo, random guesses will onlymake things more confusing!    Do you have any real proof, Jojo?    I've found a wayto identify Stand users.    -What?-That is...    When a Stand user    takes even the slightest whiffof cigarette smoke,    a vein pops upon the tip of their nose.    What the hell are they all doing?    You're not serious, Jotaro!    Relax, I'm lying.    Apparently, someone fell for it.    Jotaro, what tipped you offabout the captain?    Actually, I didn't have a clue.    I'd planned to use that trickon the whole crew.    And I fell for it.Hat's off to you, boy.    You're right. I'm not the captain.    The real captain issleeping with the fishes    at the bottom of the China Sea.    Then I guess that meansyou'll be snoozing in hell!    Damn!    I can't move...    Trouble on the water!Lies and betrayal!    The Moon card representsthe fear of the unknown.    Its name: Dark Blue Moon!    Five-on-one is a little tougheven for me,    which is why I keptmy identity secret    to pick you off one by one...    But since you've figured me out,I guess I have no choice.    Five-on-one it is!    Getting my hands on hershows that lady luck is on my side!    Now I think I'll take a dipin these shark-infested waters    with the runt.    If you wanna save her,    you're gonna have todive in after us.    On my home turf,I can take on all five of you.    Go on, act tough while youhide behind a hostage!    It'll take a lot more than thatto shake me up!    It's no act. It's a prediction!    I hear your Stand,Star Platinum, is pretty fast.    Not trying to brag,    but my Dark Blue Moonis king underwater.    It's far swifter thanany fish in the sea!    Why don't we pit themagainst each other right now?    Come on in...if you're not afraidof a little seawater, that is!    He hit me before I could fall...    That's impossible...    You're the only oneswallowin' salt water today, pops.    Tell 'em, Avdol.    Your folly was trying toout-predict a fortune teller...    ...tough break.    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    There he goes.    For talking up his Stand so much,that was a pretty pathetic exit.    What's wrong, Jotaro?Pull the girl up, would ya?    What's wrong, Jotaro?    Damn it...Something's pulling me in...    These are...    barnacles!    Crustaceans that live betweenhigh and low tides!    They stretch fromStar Platinum's arm    all the way tothe side of the boat!    He's still gotsome fight left in him.    He must've attached themwhen I hit him before.    They're spreading!    He's trying to drainmy Stand's power...    Now he's gone!    The captain,he's completely disappeared!    Jotaro! Pull in your Stand!    What do you think I'm trying to do?    That's why I'm sweatinglike a freakin pig, old man!    -Jojo!-Jotaro!    Jojo!    Crap!    This isn't good!    Welcome! Welcome!    So glad you could join mein the watery depths,    where Dark Blue Moon rules.    You should have neverunderestimated me, brother.    We may be underwater,but our Stands can still talk.    How bout you pop out another one ofthose cocky one-liners like before.    Go ahead, brother!    So what'll it be?    Tell me what kind offish dish you want to be.    Fish paste? Or maybe some sashimi?    I'll make one hell of a mealout of your Stand.    You fool...    You act tough, brother,    but I know what you're thinking.    "How long can this guystay underwater?    I could probably lasttwo minutes, tops.    Could he last longer?"    Well, guess what?    My lung capacity is three timesthat of a normal human!    And I've been in training.    My personal best issix minutes, twelve seconds!    You must be dizzyjust hearing that number.    And!    Dark Blue Moon's flippers    slice through the waterwith sharp, screw like rotations!    But before you startmouthing off again,    take a good, hard lookat your Stand!    Seems Dark Blue Moon's barnacles    have taken a liking toabsorbing your Stand's power.    How's it feel to haveyour life energy    slowly draining away?    Trying to escape to the surface?    Take a good look around you!    Dark Blue Moon's been busymaking a whirlpool.    Haven't you noticed, brother?    Swim! Come on, swim!    You're running out of airand strength!    But k*lling a stupid, smart-asspunk like you right now    would be a bit too early!    It's been too long!He's not coming up yet?    A whirlpool!It's a giant whirlpool!    But where's Jojo?    I'm going in!    These are scales!    That guy's Stand has scalesas sharp as razors!    The whirlpool is full of them!    He wasn't bluffing when he saidhe could b*at us one-on-five.    It's like a watery antlion pitdown there!    If we dive in, it's very possiblewe'll be sliced to pieces.    His scales?    Let me guess whatyou're thinking now!    "A whirlpool hasone point of calm."    I can read you like a book!    "It's the eye!    If I jump into the centerwhere he is, I can att*ck him."    That's what you're thinking,isn't it?    If you think you can hit mewith that punch of yours again,    then come right over.    Come at me withyour worthless Stand,    its power is so drained,it doesn't have a chance!    See if you can manage an att*ck    that's even sharper thanthese underwater cutters!    I'm waiting, brother!    Curses...We're completely helpless!    It's Jojo!    I saw Jojo in the whirlpool!    This isn't good!He was limp!    Limp? He wasn't struggling at all?    That might be a good thing.    What?    Weren't you going toturn me into sashimi?    You're the onewho's going to be sliced up!    Star Finger!    Wha...    Looks like you're sashimi,after all.    What's that? I can't hear you.You're gonna have to speak up!    We're underwater!    But your power was being drained...    You let yourself go limp on purpose    to concentrate your powerin your fingers...    That's what you were thinking...    Nope. The only thing on my mind...    is how gross it'll be,when I kick your stupid ass,    and you piss yourself underwater.    Bye, pops.    Jojo!    That's my grandson!    Well done, Jotaro!Now get up here already.    The captain planted bombson the ship!    Damn it!    Hurry up and get in the lifeboats!    Send out a distress call!     DARK BLUE MOONFAKE CAPTAIN DRAGON    Have some water.    We've sent out distress calls,so someone should be here soon.    What the hell is going on here?Who are you guys?    Just think of usas fellow travelers.    You're on a journeyto see your father,    while I'm on one for my daughter.    Hey! That's the onlyfresh water we have!    Don't spit it out!    No...    Everyone, look!    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    What is this boat?    The ramp's down, so why hasn'tanyone shown their face?    There are no signs of life.    I'm all sticky from the salt water...    So that's what this means...    You think you've won...
02x07 - StrengthQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:29Enyaba, I have somethingI'd like to ask you.  What does it mean to live?  It is to obtain all that what one desires.  If you were to distill lifeinto its essence,  that is what it would be.  A desire for riches, a desire for fame,  for food, love, and lovers...  But one must always fightto obtain what one wants,  isn't that correct, Enyaba?   Indeed.   And if the battle is lost,   and one fails to obtainwhat one desires most,   the result is frustration, pain,and a sense of failure.   One carries the wound into the future,   into the next fearful battle.   I believe conquering that fearonce and for all   is what it means to live.   The one who stands at the pinnacleis the one who has no fear.   Do you understand, Enyaba?   I was the one who told you about   the existence of your Standand how to use it.   Also you have an immortal body.   Is there anything you could possibly fear?   Perhaps.   What burdens you, my lord?   The Joestar bloodline.   The Joestars? They worry you?Those worms are mere trash.   They are no match for your Stand!   Yes...   But I must believe it's destinywhen the lives of those worms   are so thoroughly entangled with my own.   Let me be clear...   It is not the Joestars whom I fear.   But the fact that I can neverunderestimate their bloodline.   I have decided that I must removethe Joestars from the cogs of fate.   You desire to go forthand eliminate them yourself   simply because you feelthey must not be underestimated?   Yes.   Foolishness!   You must never engagein such trivial matters!   I have sent seven Stand users to command:   The Empress, The Hanged Man,Strength, The Wheel of Fortune,   Temperance, The Emperor, and The Devil.   All of them ready to strike!   Thanks to them, you need nottake any action yourself, Lord Dio.   Whoa!   It's a freighter!   It just appeared out of nowhere!   Jotaro, something's bothering you,isn't it?   You worried another Stand user'son this thing, too?   Not quite.   Strange they lowered the stairs   but there's not a single soulto be seen anywhere.   The ship came all this way to rescue us!   Some sort of crew has to be onboard!   Well, I don't careif they're all Stand users.   I'm getting on this boat.   Take my hand, kid. I'll help you up.   Good grief.   What's with this ship?   There's no captain in the control room!   No engineer in the radio room.   There's no one anywhere!   And yet, look at this!   All the gauges and machineryare working just like normal.   Maybe they're all just in the bathroom   with a bad case of the runs!   Hey! Isn't anyone around?   Guys, come quick!   An ape!   An ape's sitting in that cage.   It's an orangutan.   Who the hell cares about a friggin ape?   Let's split up and findwhoever's been feeding this thing.   Well?   It doesn't appear to be broken, but...   Avdol! That sailor! Watch out!   Good grief.   That isn't any way togreet a lady, now is it?   No one was touching the controls...   Nobody touched the lever.   That crane moved all by itself! I saw it!   That crane impaled him on its own!   Careful! Something's here.   Hey! Don't touch the machinery!   If it moves or runs on electricity,don't lay a finger on it!   If you want to live, then you'll doexactly as I tell you.   Get into the cabin belowuntil I tell you otherwise!   Did anyone see a Stand just now?   No...   My apologies...   I was closest to the crane,yet I sensed nothing.   All right. I'll send Hierophantto investigate!   I have no idea what's going on,   but scary things keep happeningwhenever you guys are around.   Could you guys be jinxed?   I've heard about people who causedisasters that endanger everyone.   If that's what you are,   I'd better stay away.    I can tell you one thing for certain:    We are on your side.    Make sure you stay with the others.Got it?    Okay.    You want me to let you out?    I can't.    I don't know where the key is.Plus you're too big to let out.    You're giving me an apple?    Strange...    This apple's been cut with a Kn*fe,and it hasn't gone brown yet...    It must've just been cut.    Hey, so there is someonesomewhere on this boat, right?    Do you know wherethe person who feeds you is?    You sure are a smart monkey.    A monkey like youis actually into looking at    pinups of girls?    Hey, kid, be careful!    I've heard an orangutan    has five times the strengthof the average human.    He could easily rip off your arm.    Now, come with usto the room down the hall.    You can't be alone.    Okay...    It's inconceivable.    I had Hierophant Greenscour every corner...    yet no sign of human life.    We searched every pipeand crevice, but nothing!    Anything?    It's no use. I can't get a connection.    Well, try again, dammit!    Gross, I'm all stickyfrom the salt water...     DESTRUCTIVE POWER, SPEED     RANGE, PERSISTENCE,PRECISION, DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL    Hey!    Jojo!    You forgot your lock!    Seems this ape...isn't your run-of-the-mill monkey.    Could he be...    Could he have ripped out the fan?    So this ape's a Stand user.    But where's the Stand?    Why can't I see it?    What?    The steel propeller bent on its own?    -Jojo!    -Hey, what's going on here?    Son of a bitch!    There's no Stand in sight andsomehow the window broke?    Star Platinum!    What's with this thing?    The ape just sank into the walland disappeared!    Hey. You saw that, right?    Stay close to me.    It's not safe in here.    The ape vanished into the wall...    But that orangutanhas to be the Stand user...    When I touched it,    I could feel Stand energyemanating from him.    But why can't I see the Stand?    Wait... What if I'm seeing it already...    What?    What is this?    Crap!    This is...    This freighter...    Could this ship itself be...    So the Stand is the freighter!    Crap!    All of it! Everything!    This ship itself is justone gigantic Stand!    The ship?    But non-Stand users like the girland sailors can see it! How?    The Stand must use so much energythat it's visible to the naked eye!    But it would takean enormous amount of power    to control a Stand like this.    Kakyoin!    You have to use Hierophant Greento let Jotaro know!    I can't!    It's got hold of my Stand, too.    So this is what it means to face death.    We're completely done for.    It's crushing us...    At this rate, our bodiesare going to be pulverized.    We'll all be...    We were careless...    The word the orangutanwas pointing to was "strength."    It means force, energy, power, or aid.    And...it is the eighth cardof the Tarot deck!    It suggests challenge,a strong will, and hidden powers!    Damn ape, thinks he's already won.    "This entire ship is my Stand."    "You've lost!"    "And there's nothing you can do!"    Jotaro needed no explanation.    He knew exactly what the ape was saying!    That button's not your Stand.    Does that upset you?    I guess it wounded your pride,    since you thought you'd already won.    Nah, it's not hurt at all...    Cause ape's like you've got no pride!    That's exactly what makes youan ape and not a man.    What's going to hurt now...    is your head!    Good grief.    I've heard frightened animalsexpose their bellies    as a display of submission.    Are you asking me to forgive you?    I'm afraid your actions haveoverstepped the laws of the jungle.    So I don't think so.    It's all deformed...The whole ship is twisting up!    Hey, save it, will ya?    This ship's going down.    It's time to go.Get back to the life boats!    I can't believe it.    The ship's totally changing.    It's turning into a shabby little boat...    What terrifying power...    That ape was travelingthe ocean on its own Stand.    Never before have I witnessed such energy.    We were completely helpless.    If Jotaro hadn't figured it out,we would've been done for.    I hate to think this power andferocity could be a sign    of things to come.    Hey, you want some gum?    So we're lost at sea again.    Good grief. This cig is soaked.    We'll have plenty of timefor them to dry, Jojo.    Just have to pray we get rescuedand taken to Singapore.    It's been four days since we left Japan...    There are    days left untiltime runs out for the Joestars.     STRENGTHFOREVER    It appears Strength has been defeated.    But have no fear.    The remaining six Stand usersare all very powerful.    And one of them is my own!    My son's right handwill crush our enemies!    You are a strange old woman.    What is it that you desire most?    Oh, but I've told you many times...    My only wish is to stay by your side.    Your guardian spirithas unbelievable power.    Your ability to escape trouble,and your strange life,    are the result of that.    I would like to see your life unfold!    It's the only thing I want...    Once upon a time, there wasa prince from the land of Sumatra    who traveled the seas, seeking new lands.    Eventually, he happened upon an island    inhabited by white-manned lionscalled Singas,    an island he named Singa Pura.    Today, its straits bustlewith ships and tankers    from around the world!    This nation that shares bothWestern and Eastern heritage    thanks to free trade is Singapore!    Good grief. We finally made it.    We'll stay at a hotel tonightand figure out our route to Egypt.    All right, let's stay at that one.    I guess you guys won't evengive us a chance to rest.    She'll be in danger if she stays with us.    And Polnareff fell into that trap?    -There...-...is...    -...a...-...traitor.    Joestar, you bastard.
02x08 - The DevilQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:29Hey, you!  Yeah, you with the flat top!  Yeah, you! You threw this trash,didn't you?  That's a five-hundredSingapore dollar fine!  What? Five hundred?  Here in Singapore,   the law prohibits littering andfines all violators for doing so!  Five hundred Singapore dollars...  That's about forty thousand yen.   Trash?   Got it?   Trash?   What are you talking about, sir?   All I see on the ground hereis my own luggage.   Would you be so kind as to tell me   what trash you're referring to, officer?   You sure you see some trash?   You mean, that bag's your luggage?   Yeah, you got it.   I'm terribly sorry.   Well, I'll be going, then...   Shoo, shoo.   What's up with this kid?She's back with us again?   Hey, weren't you goingto go see your father?   Stop hanging around and get going. Shoo!   I'm meeting him in five days.   And I can go wherever the hell I want!   I'm not taking orders from you, jerks.   It's not safe for a little girlto accompany us.   Well maybe she lacks the cashfor a place to stay.   Then that's it...   We'll have to get her a room.   Hey, Polnareff,   get her to come with us,and try not to bruise her ego.   You got it.   Hey!   You're stinkin' poor, aren't you?   Consider this your lucky day, freeloader.   Well, let's check in...   Right...   I'm terribly sorry, sir,   but we tend to be bookedthis time of year.   The rooms we have availableare located on different floors.   Is that all right, sir?   Well, I guess we're stuck.   Then for the rooms...   Avdol and I will share a room...   It'd make sense forJotaro and I to share a room,   since we're both students.   Then that leaves the last roomto Polnareff and...   You're kidding!Like I'd room with that guy!   What?   Well, she may be a child,   but let's give the young ladyher own room...   We'll take four rooms please.   Yes, of course!   Fine, I can relax morein my own room anyway!   I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight!   Let's go.   We've been through all kinds of hell   ever since we left Hong Kong.   We should hurry up and take a shower   in a place where it's actually safe.   See ya!   I should've guessed.   Couldn't you guys at leastgive us a chance to rest?   Come out.    EPISODE EIGHT: THE DEVIL   That's some insanely intensebloodlust you've got there.   How about telling me your name,before I, Polnareff, take you out.   My name is Soul Sacrifice,   and my Stand is the card of the Devil.   It represents insanity of the cursed,   and a precipitous and malevolentfall into ruin.   But tell me, how did you knowI was hiding in the fridge?   You... Dumbass bastard!   You took everything out of the fridge   and didn't bother putting any of it away!   Ebony Devil!   Silver Chariot!   Wow, you're really pathetic, aren't you?   That ape on the boat   was a far more powerful andterrifying Stand user than you.   Now look at what you've done, Polnareff!   How dare you do this to me?   It hurts!   It really hurts!   What the hell?   The pain!   Curse you...   How dare you? How dare you do this to me?   Now I can hold one hell ofa grudge against you!   Such t*rture...Such agony must be avenged!   I let you find me andatt*ck me on purpose!   He's...   He's gone?   What the hell is going on?   This is unreal! When did he cut me?   I don't think I...No, I know I didn't feel a thing.    Mr. Joestar! A Stand userwas hiding in my room!    Wait, is that you, Avdol?    Anyway, listen up!I can't figure this guy out.    I couldn't tellif he was weak or strong...    He's really creepy!    And he got away... Damn it, what the hell?    You'd better watch out!    Somehow he was able to slice open my leg.    The Devil card? Soul Sacrifice...    Are you absolutely certainthat's what he said?    Yeah. I'm racking my brain,I just don't see how it's possible.    I did catch a glimpse of his Stand.    And yet, he was in no positionto att*ck me    when my leg was gouged.    Anyway!    I should be there in five.    You're in room twelve-twelve, aren't you?    On the twelfth floor?    Get Kakyoin and Jotaro, too,will ya? Later!    Front desk.    Hello? Room service?    I hurt my leg a bit...    Could you send upsome medicine and bandages?    This is Polnareff, from room nine-twelve.    Certainly.We'll bring it up immediately, sir.    Aw, geez...    No matter how you cut it,    dirty underwear makes fora really shitty band-aid.    Damn it...    So, I was wondering, do you knowabout this guy who att*cked, Avdol?    Indeed.    He is Soul Sacrifice.    A Native American shamanwho works as an assassin for hire.    He's a terrifying Stand user.    Mafias, militaries, politicians...    lowlifes the world over hire him.    I've seen his face only once.    And it was covered in scars!    Scars he receives by cunninglyprovoking his enemy to att*ck.    That's how he gainsthe "power of vengeance"    he uses to control his Stand.    That's why, to ordinary people,    it appears that a cursek*lled the victims.    So Polnareff has fallen into his trap?    I am very worried.    What kind of Stand is it?    No one knows for certain.    Those who've seen it are dead.    It's too dangerous forPolnareff to be alone.    Or any of us.    You're telling me this guy and his curse    have the power to k*ll us, one by one...    He'll be here in five minutes.    Let's all meet up in this room.    Got it. We'll see you inroom twelve-twelve soon, old man.    What was that all about, Jojo?    Let's go. Apparently we're in danger.    Now that's odd. I can't find my room key.    I could have sworn I set it here...    Damn it! Where is it?    Now how in the hellam I going to get back in here?    Could I tell the front deskand ask for a new one?    There's probably a fine for that.    There it is.    Must've fallen during all the commotion.    Wha...    What?    What's...    What the hell, shampoo? Damn it! My eyes!    Who's there?    Crap, this isn't good!    I'm a sitting duck under here!    Mr. Polnareff, this is room service.    I've brought you a first aid kit.    Get out of here! You'll be k*lled!    Huh? What in the world is going on here?    Get out of here!    I told you, you'll get yourself k*lled!    How dare you?    How dare you s*ab one of my eyes out,    Polnareff?    A doll? What kind of...    Silver Chariot!    Are you stupid?    Your Stand can't fight what you can't see!     EBONY DEVILSOUL SACRIFICE    Oh, Jojo.    Did you need something?    So you are here.    Listen up.You need to stay put for a while.    Huh?    I'll come for you later.    Don't open the door for any strangers.    Okay...    Damn it!    How heavy is this bed, anyway?    It's gotta be at leasta hundred twenty kilograms...    I've got to use Silver Chariot's sword    to cut through this cord...    You little bastard!    As soon as I stop attacking, this happens.    You better believe I'm gonnakeep blindly stabbing    every centimeter of this room!    You suck!    Looks like the big, scary knight    can't even pin the tail onthe donkey when he's blindfolded!    Those senses of yours...    are as dull as a butterknife!    Bastard...    I've just about had it with you...    You little runt!    It's just you two?    Why isn't the girl with you?    Well, we went to check on her...    She's not a Stand user;    Bringing her here would onlyplace her in more danger.    Suppose you're right.So that leaves Polnareff.    But man, he's so late...    It's been way over five minutes.    Let me out of here!    Gotcha!    Time to snap your spear in half.    All right. Damn it...    At least I'm finally freeof those cords...    I've got to get Chariot under the bed    and get the hell out of here.    Now what's he doing?    Huh?    Hey, Polnareff!    How'd you like it if I tooka bite out of your balls?    What an obscene little jerk.    Chariot!    Whoa, there.    Now to hide where he can't see me!    You numbskull!    Give that floor you're stuck toa good feel!    This is...    You're soaked in beer, juice, and alcohol!    I just put that well-stocked barto good use!    And if I had piss in me,    I would've soaked you with that too!    And now... what do you think I'm gonna do    with this hair dryerand your soggy self, Polnareff?    I'm not gonna dry you off!    Die!    Time to put an end to this curse...    Polnareff!    You're not the only onewho can break stuff!    How did you know precisely where I was?    I was on top of the bed!    I broke the mirror!    So I could see you hanging over the bed    clear as day from down here.    At last, we meet.    Whoa, there.    Hey, Soul Sacrifice.    I have a question.    I seek a man with two right hands.    How about you tell mewho that guy's Stand is?    You idiot!    No assassin worth a damn wouldever reveal his Stand's identity!    It only happens in the faceof certain death,    for him or his opponent!    To know a man's Stand,is to know his weakness!    Only you guys are dumb enough to do that!    If it wasn't for that mirror,I would've taken you out!    All right. Come at me then!    What's the matter?    Didn't you say you were going tobite off my balls or something?    Just try it, you vulgar little sh*t!    I'm gonna...    slice up everything except your balls!    Um, sir...    It seems you've been inthe bathroom for quite some time.    Are you all right?     SOUL SACRIFICE'S...     SOUL SACRIFICE'S... LAST MOMENTS     Polnareff, you're finally here.    You're not terribly punctual.    Okay, everyone, let's get right to it.    Let's come up with a planin case Soul Sacrifice att*cks.    I'm b*at...     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    Answer me!    Why was there a dead boy's bodyin your room?    And what about the dead bodyin the bathroom...    The two are connected, aren't they?    Answer me!    I have the right to remain silent.    So you finally decided to show up!I've been waiting.    I had the Speedwagon Foundationstrike a deal.     Polnareff should be released soon enough.     But that was cutting it close.     To think that the enemy's pursuitwould come so early on...     As long as Dio is usingJonathan Joestar's body as his own,     he'll be able to track Jotaro and me.     He won't leave us any time to rest.     But we can read his thoughtsjust as he reads ours.     Shall I go buy a camera?     That won't be necessary.     I can use my powers    even without a camera.    What?    Michael's still not here? Where's Michael?    This week's number three jumps upfive points from last week...    Gold prices have...    You look delicious, meow.    What?    The channels are changingas if the tv has a mind of its own!    It's looking for the right wordsamong the channels    to create a message...    for the ear, not the eye.    There...    ...is...    ...a...    There! It said, "There is a"!    ...trai...    ...tor...    ...among...    ...us...    What? What did it just...    I could be wrong, but I think it said,    "There is a traitor among us..."    -Ka...-...kyo...    -...in...-...Beware...    -...of...-...him...    -Di...-...o's...    -...ser...-...va...    -...nt...    Kakyoin? What?    Impossible. Kakyoin is Dio's servant?    This is...    Joseph Joestar,you're watching me, aren't you?    Dio!    He found us! Look out!    But that can't be true, can it?    You know as well as I do.    Hermit Purple saysKakyoin is working with Dio    and betraying us.    It can't be!    I still trust Kakyoin.    There must be a reason behind this.    But if he is indeed connected to Dio,    he could exterminate usin our sleep, at any moment.    He'd be Dio's very own Trojan Horse!    So then where is Kakyoin?    He's with Jotaro.    Hey, Jotaro.    Are you going to eat that cherry?    Hey, what are you doing, Kakyoin?They'll die!    Could he really be a traitor?    A back-breaker? Such a drastic move!    This is unforgivable, isn't it?

Ice cream is good,but this baby here...   chilled coconut juice,nothing in the world like it.   How bout it?   I guess we can try it.   Three then.   Thankya much. That'll be twelve dollars.   Hey, make it six dollars! Six dollars!   This should cover it.   Okay.   Enjoy!   I'll take that!   So you...   Thought you could just grab my wallet,   you disgusting piece of sh*t!   Huh?   I'll have you spewing blood!   Kakyoin!   Why, you...   vile little cockroach d*ck,   how dare you touch my wallet...   with the same grimy fingersthat wipe that filthy ass!   I can't let you get awaywith that, now can I?   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Hey! What are you doing, Kakyoin?   You'll k*ll the bastard.   Oh my God, a back-breaker?   Such a brutal move!   And he's using such filthy language...   It's not like him at all.   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Kakyoin!   I told you to cut it out!What are you, deaf?   Dammit, Kakyoin.   You're not right.   What the hell's gotten into you?   That hurt...   No need to push...   That man tried to steal my wallet.He committed a crime.   And criminals should be punished.   Tell me, am I wrong, Jotaro?   This guy...    What are you glaring at?    The look in your eyesis awfully hostile, Jotaro.   You couldn't possibly be thinkingabout ending our friendship   over a little tussle with a thief,now would you?   Look, a beetle.   -That's awesome!-A beetle? Where?   -There're four of them up there.-I see them!   -There're four of them up there.-So cool!   You're making way too muchout of this, Jojo.   I'm just having a bad day.   I'm so exhausted from the trip,it's put me in such a bad mood.   Just a bad mood, huh?   Seemed to me you felt pretty good.   The old man and Avdol   think it's a good ideafor us to head to India by train.   We leave tomorrow.   We'll take the cable car   to Singapore Station to reserve tickets.   Mr. Kakyoin...   Jojo's already gone.   Right. I'll catch up in just a second.   I guess you like coconut juicea whole lot, huh, Mr. Kakyoin?   Huh?   Was that a beet...   No. I must be imagining things.   It must have been a piece ofcoconut or something.   Oh yes. I do love coconuts.   What's up, half pint?   Uh, nothing.   Hey, Jotaro.   Are you going to eat that cherry?   If not, then hand it over already.   I'm starving.   Uh-oh! Better watch out, Jotaro!   Jojo!   Good one, huh?   I'm only playing with you,good ol' Jotaro.   Kakyoin... It's likehe's a totally different person!   That look again!   What's with all this hardcore glaring,   Jotaro, old pal?   Get in, Kakyoin.   The cable car just got here.   Now I told you to get in.   See, I've got your ticket right here.   I'm gonna knockyour crooked, possessed ass    right into that cable car!    What?    You're a bit off.    "Possessed" isn't quite the word.    This isn't Kakyoin!    You still haven't realizedmy body's been growing    this whole time, have you?    All right, who are you?    Is he a Stand?    But I was able to touch him just now...    Unless he's a StandI can strike with my own fists?    Jojo!    I can merge withany organic matter I consume.    I'm a Stand anyone can see and touch.    I'm Yellow Temperance,of the Temperance card.    Gaze upon my handsome face with envy!    Come on, Jotaro, old pal!    Take a look at your hand.    See that little bit of me?It latched on when you hit me.    But I'm warning you:    Touch it, and it'll go afteryour left hand, too.    You should save your left handfor picking your nose!    This Stand is a slow eater...    And the more it eats, the bigger it gets.    You'll never get it off!    Damn you...    Oraa!    What do you mean, "oraa"?    When I digest you,    I'll shove your own crapdown your measly throat!    This stuff burns.    You bastard...    Hey, is this Jojo's grandpa?He's in big trouble!    Anne? What's wrong?    It's Mr. Kakyoin...    Kakyoin?    So he has betrayed us?    Mr. Kakyoin's face split open!    But Mr. Kakyoin wasn't Mr. Kakyoin!    And...    Jojo got att*cked bysome weird slime on the cable car,    and it's eating his finger!    Calm down! Where are you right now?    The boarding area forthe cable cars at the trade center!    He's being att*cked!    Mr. Kakyoin is attacking Jojo!    Hurry and come back to the hotel...    Did someone say my name just now?    Where have you been?    Jojo left me behind,so I was sunbathing by the pool.    With your uniform on?    Yes, why not?    It's all right.We have the real one here with us!    Anne, that means your Kakyoin is...    a fake!    I've been telling you that!    Jojo!    Jojo just jumped out of the cable car!    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Good grief.    A Stand that fuses with flesh?    It's devouring my finger...    But first things first,I've gotta get this thing off me.    Worst case,I might have to chop off my finger.    Think you got away?    Sorry to burst your bubble, pal.    Now dig that earwax out ofyour ears and listen up, hotshot!    My Stand, Yellow Temperance,has no weaknesses.    You didn't escape.    I just have no need to chase you!    You're as good as dead!    This'll hurt like a sonf a bitch,but it's time to torch it off.    This...    It only made it grow!    That was a bad idea...    Damn.    Pardon the intrusion.    My, my. That's certainlya bizarre entrance.    Don't mind me.    Hey, there kid.    I'm gonna need to borrowyour popsicle for a sec.    Excuse me, young man!    What do you think you're doingwith that child?    This your kid?    No, he's not, but...    Then shut up and enjoy the ride.    Sorry, kid.    When we get to the bottom,I'll buy you a new one, okay?    'Kay.    If I can't burn it off...    That bastard!    Now it's forming needles anddigging deeper into my hand!    Come now! Nothing will work,not even fire and ice!    I told you, before, didn't I?You won't find a single weakness.    You're mine, you little sh*t!    You're...    Papa! The puppy! It got our puppy!    Bastard! You were waiting for mein this cable car, weren't you?    M-My precious Pocky!    Watch out! Don't pull him!    Let go!    I've come to put an end to you...    Jotaro, old pal!    Oraa!    Pretty fast! But...    I keep telling you,I don't have any weaknesses!    Are you even listening?    You dumbass redneck!    My Stand is armorthat can also absorb power.    A defensive wall that can also att*ck!    No matter how fast orhow strong you may be,    against Yellow Temperance,you are helpless!    You can't defeat me!    You can't survive unless, of course,    you take a cleaver to your right hand!    Do you understand?    You have no way of winning!    You're not getting out of this!    Not until you're digested!I'll eat you up!    Good grief.    You're right, you reallyhave no weaknesses.    Maybe you are the world's strongest,    and that's terrifying.    But I'll tell ya, we Kujo's...    No, I mean, we Joestar's...    we use strategy to fight our waypast any obstacle.    I still have one strategy left.    What?    And that's to...    And that's to...    ...run away!    What the hell?    You're in the middle of beingeaten alive, you dumbass!    My Stand's got a hold of youthat you can't escape,    and you say you'll run away?    When I said run away...    I meant into the water!    I can't breathe...    You let your Stand's guard downto take a breath, didn't you?    Your Stand may be invincible,    but if I butcher you,your Stand dies, too.    Do you understand?    Listen, I've had it up to here withthat cocky-ass mouth of yours.    You should know,    I'm the kind of guy whotakes these things to heart.    Oraa!    Please, stop...    I can't fight anymore, I'm through!    My nose is completely shattered.    They're going to have towire my jaw shut, too.    Dio paid me to do this.    I didn't plan on risking my lifeto go after you guys.    There! See?    I want something from you.    The other Stand users,I want all the info you got.    That's the one thing I can't talk about.    I do have some pride, you know.    I can't rat them out...    Well, okay then. That's honorable.    Oh, I remember now!    Death, The Empress, The Hanged Man,and The Emperor are after you!    So, what can they do?    I don't know.    No, honest! I really don't know!    Stand users never revealtheir abilities to each other.    If they did, they'd be exposingtheir weaknesses outright.    But I do know that some witchtaught Dio about Stands...    Her son is one of the fourcoming after you.    His name is Centerfold.    He's unmistakable becausehe has two right hands.    And his card is The Hanged Man.    He's the one who k*lledPolnareff's sister, right?    I've heard the occasional rumorabout his powers...    A mirror. Apparently, he uses a mirror.    I haven't actually seen it,    but Polnareff has no chance of winning.    He's dead meat.    I just noticed something, Jotaro...    Looks like I've still gotsome luck on my side.    See that drain over there?    The one with all the blue crawdads?    Take a real good look.    A manhole...    That teeny little drain    is hooked intothis manhole right beside me!    I'm gonna pull you in and trap you!    Now you can't att*ck me!    I guess what I told you aboutthe man with two right hands    will go to waste.    Jotaro Kujo!    Aren't I lucky to havethis drain pipe to slurp you into...    Man, am I lucky!    Time to power up with some crustaceans!    I'll mash you up    and turn you into jelly!    And when I do, Dio's gonna give mea hundred million dollars.    A few minutes of brawling with you,and I will be set for life!    Aren't I lucky,you ball-less little buttmunch!    Good grief.    When you're focused on everything else,    it's difficult to observe yourself.    You just don't get it.Your luck finally ran out.    Before, you got awaywith only a broken nose.    Now you'll be lucky if you haveany bones left to break!    He punched me with water...from inside the drain?    I was only kidding around, Mr. Jotaro!    I swear, I was just messing with ya!    Just a little prank.    Come on, don't tell meyou took that to heart?    You're not thinking of punching meany more, are you?    I'm seriously injured here...    My nose is broken and my jaw'sgonna have to be wired shut...    I've got nothing left to say to you.    You're way too pathetic    I'm done wasting my breath.     YELLOW TEMPERANCERUBBER SOUL    Good grief.    So we're finally on our way to India.    And the man with two right handsis called Centerfold...    By the way, where did Anne run off to?    She was hanging around Singapore Station    right before our train departed, but...    I'm sure it was time for herto meet her father.    That story about her dadsounded real fishy to me.    I bet she's a runaway!    But it is a bit lonely withoutthat little rugrat, right, Jojo?    It's eerie...    To think, a Stand coulddisguise himself as me.    Seems he had already turned intoyou by the time I left the hotel.    Jojo, are you going to eat that cherry?    Not to be greedy,but they are my favorite.    Could I have one?    Yeah, sure.    Thank you.    Hey, look, Jojo. Flamingos in flight.    Oh, good grief.    Jojo...    My wallet's already been stolen!    No, thank you!    Tip!    If you don't give me a tip,you won't go to heaven, Mister.    Hey! Don't put your nose on it!    Avdol! Is this India?    Yes! Isn't it a great country?
02x10 - The Emperor and the Hanged Man, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:31Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore...  So the Indian leg of our journeyis finally upon us...  But, well, I'm a little worried.  I've always heard Indiais the land of curry  and rampant disease.  I'm worried my stomach won'tbe able to handle the culture gap.  That assessment is rather distorted.  You needn't worry.  It is a beautiful countrywith wonderful people.   That I assure you.   Well, this is Calcutta. Let's get going.   Hey, give me a tip!   Let me carry that for you!   Want a tattoo? You're very pretty.   Need some anti-venom?It won't hurt your stomach.   Let me show you my hotel!   Calcutta, India.   In the   th century,its population reached    million.   Calcutta buzzes with a bustling energy   that will pull you inand never let you go!   -I stepped in a pile of cow sh*t!-I don't need any.   -Damn it!-I don't need any.   -Somebody's already stolen my wallet!-Seriously, thank you, but no!   Tip! Tip! Tip!   If you don't give me a tip,you won't go to heaven, sir.   Hey! Don't rub your noseall over my stuff!   Avdol! So this is India?   See? Great country, isn't it?   They're what make India great,don't you think?    EPISODE TEN: THE EMPERORAND THE HANGED MAN, PART ONE   Here, try this.   This is chai.   I think you'll find it to your liking.   Chai.   One of India's most popular drinks.   A sweet concoction of   black tea, sugar, ginger, and milk.   At last, a little peace.   Be patient with India.   Once you get used to it, you'll seehow wonderful this country is.   You know, I kinda like this place.It's pretty cool.   What, Jotaro? You can't be serious?   Talk about culture shock.   Guess I'll like itonce I get used to it, huh?   Well, I suppose people adapt totheir surroundings eventually.   Where's the john?   Right over there, sir.   Polnareff.   Yeah?   What do you want to eat?   Pick for me.   It'd better be something amazing.   Something gorgeous and sophisticated   that suits a Frenchman like moi.   Which means it doesn't matter.   Let's see, something he'll like...   Excuse me.   Pardon me, sir, one moment...   Huh?   If you could please use this.   What's this wooden stick for?   Hey.   That's a weird looking toilet,but at least it's clean.   A gentleman like myself simplycannot tolerate a dirty bathroom.   Sir, is something wrong?   Don't "Is something wrong?" me!   The toilet...   The toilet...   There's a pig in the toilet!   This kind of toilet is rare even in India.   The builders constructedthe pig pen down below   higher than they were supposed to.   So when the pigs gets hungry,they come up for more.   That's not what I'm aski...   No, wait, what?   You're telling me this pig's food is...   That's what it's there for?   As I mentioned, sir, use this.   Here...   See? Now you can do your businesswhile the pig's knocked down.   Our manager gets the pigto lick his buttocks   and always sings his praises.   He gets it so clean.   Please, take your time.   Wait! Don't leave me in here alone!   I don't think I could everget used to this...   Guess I'll hold ittill we get to the hotel.   Sorry to keep you waiting.   Crap.   Where is he?   Weird... I could've swornI saw someone out there.   Must've been my imagination.   Guess I shouldn't be surprised.   I mean, I did just see a pig in the john.   Of course I'd imaginea monster in the window.   So this is what they meanby culture shock here.   What?   What the hell?   I can see this damn thingonly in the mirror!    This must be the mirror StandJotaro was talking about.    This is not good.    This is so not good!    Silver Chariot!    Where'd that bastard go?    Damn it!    Stand!    Where's the user? Who is it?    The man with two right hands...    Too many people...    Damn it!    What's wrong, Polnareff?    What is this about?    If that...    If that was a Stand, then that means...    Then that means he's here!    Jotaro! It's the Stand useryou heard about—    the one who uses the mirrors!    The bastard who k*lled my sister!    The scum who heartlessly trampled    my sister's life, soul, and dignity.    Finally... Finally we meet!    Are you sure it's him?    Mr. Joestar, I'll be travelingon my own from here on out.    What?    With my sister's m*rder*rfinally within reach,    I'll be damned if I'm going towait for him to come after me.    It would put me at a disadvantage,and that's just not my style.    I'll find him first and k*ll him!    But we don't even know what he looks like,    or what his Stand is.    He's got two right hands,that's enough for me!    And he knows I'm after him,    so he'll be on the defensive.    See ya.    Tough talk from a manwho's digging his own grave.    And that means?    Just as it sounds, my friend.    Are you trying to say I can't win?    Yes.    Can't you see?The enemy att*cked to isolate you!    I won't let you go it alone, Polnareff.    Listen. Let me make one thing clear:    I never once gave a damn about Dio.    I told you in Hong Kong I'd tag alongso I could get my revenge.    Mr. Joestar and Jotaro already know this.    I've been alone from the start!    I've always been fighting alone!    You selfish fool!    Did you forget that Dio brainwashed you?    Did you forget thathe's the root of all this?    You have no idea how it feelsto have your sister m*rder*d!    I heard the last time you met Dio,    you ran like a dog withhis tail between his legs!    A coward like you would neverunderstand why I need to do this!    What did you say?    Don't touch me.    You got lucky that dayyou b*at me in Hong Kong.    Enough with this lecturing!    How dare you...    Oh, did that offend you?    Don't forget...    I'm a hell of a lot more pissed offthan you right now!    You can just keep being yourself,    with your holierthan thou attitude, Avdol.    Why, you!    Mr. Joestar!    That's enough. Just let him go.    No one can stop him now.    I've lost all respect for him, that's all.    My impression of him was completely wrong.    I did indeed run in fear from him.    But I'm certain that foresightwill let us win.    Rushing in without thinkingwill get us all k*lled.    Oh?    Then I'll say this with certainty, too.    Your little divination will be wrong.    Time to get off.    I'm here to see a friend of mine.    You're on your own from here.    Please, make me your wife.    My life will belong to you.    Just say whatever you wish of me, my love.    Please, let me stay by your side forever.    Baby, don't be stupid.You're still sixteen.    I'm old enough to marry.    I love you.    Listen. I'm just a no-good drifter, baby.    I live each day like it's my last,and one day, it will be my last.    You have royal blood.    We can't have a fairy-tale marriage.    No matter how much we love each other.    Really?    So you do love me?    Yep. You're my one and only, hun.    That's exactly why...    It's 'cause I love youthat we can't marry.    You understand, don't you?    This breaks my heart just asmuch as it breaks yours.    But I'll come back to see you andhold you like this whenever I can.    That's enough to make me happy.    Yes...    So long. Love ya, darling.    You know, it's bad manners to eavesdrop.    You think I spend too much timeon romance, don't ya?    When you've got girls like her allover the world at your beck and call...    you've always got a partner, an ally.    They'd do anything for me,even throw away their own lives.    You are aware of how I work, aren't you,    Mr. Centerfold?    By the way, about this Polnareffof the Silver Chariot.    Seems he left the group andis looking for you on his own.    What do you wanna do?    He totally fell for your plan,hook, line, and sinker.    Shall we go and k*ll him first?    Let's go.    Between your Hanged Man and my Emperor,    I have no doubt we can k*ll 'em all.    HANGED MANCENTERFOLD    So he really did leave us after all.    What?    You've seen him?    You sure you saw a manwith two right hands?    Where?    Huh?    I don't understand. He was right there.    What?    There, he was with that man in the street.    The g*n is mightier than the sword.    Not bad, if I do say so myself.    Who the hell are you?    Hol Horse. That's what they call me.    I'm a Stand user,and my card is the Emperor.    I've been paid good moneyby Dio to rub you guys out.    Look here, cowboy, I don't givea rat's ass who you say you are.    Where's the man with two right hands?    That was rude.You asked who I am, so I answered.    Well, whatever.    I came here with that guy.    He's nearby.    What?    Where is he?     There's really no pointin your asking that.     I, Hol Horse, will havethe pleasure of snuffing you out.     Morons like you always talk trash,     and it always ends upthe other way around.     Oh? Was that funny?     Lord Dio had you pegged:     "Polnareff has the fatal habit ofunderestimating his opponents.     b*ating him into a corpsewon't be any trouble for you."    He was exactly right,so I couldn't help but laugh.    If I have to take you out to get to him,    then that's exactly what I'll do.    Bring it.    Ever heard of m*llitary chess?    The t*nk is stronger than the soldier,    and tanks are weak against mines.    See, it's pretty muchthe basics of battle.     My Emperor is stronger than you,so I thought I'd be a gentleman.     I'll fill you in on my Stand'sabilities before we fight.     The g*n is mightier than the sword.    Such a brilliant quote.    What are you trying to say, exactly?    That I have a Stand that sh**t.    And a sword simply can't b*at that.    So, what? A pea sh**t?    -Prepare to die!-Prepare to die!    You underestimated me, Polnareff!    And now, you're dead!    If I take off my armor...    I can knock down a b*llet!    What?    That's impossible! It bypassed my sword!    Oh crap!    The b*llet is also my Stand.    And that cocky attitudejust cost you your life!    Polnareff!    Wha... Avdol!    I came here becauseI was worried about you,    and what do I find?    Your ego will bethe end of you, Polnareff.    You were worried about me?    Damn you!You came here to lecture me again?    The enemy already knowseverything about you!    You said you're a loner,    but from now on,you can't win on your own!    What bad timing foran outsider to interfere.    Out of the way, Polnareff!The b*llet's coming back!    Magician's Red!    I'll melt it down!    Damn that Avdol!He went after Polnareff himself.    Where are you, Mr. Avdol? Polnareff?    I have a terrible feeling...    Hey, there's a weird fightgoing on over there.    The puddle...    What?    Mr. Avdol!    Man, today must be my day.    My g*n and Centerfold's mirrorare weak against Aldol's fire    I figured Avdol would bethe toughest one to k*ll.    Talk about luck!    Looks like no more threatsin this game of m*llitary chess!    Mr. Avdol!    He's just hurt...    It's just a minor wound.    See? He's going to start speaking...    He'll open his eyes in a moment.    Right, Mr. Avdol?    You're going to wake up, right?    Mr. Avdol, you gotta wake up!    Please! Mr. Avdol!    That seemed awfully easy.    It was too quick!    That's what he gets for lecturing people.    Look at him now.    What did you say, Polnareff?    Mr. Avdol was worried about you!    Who asked him for help?     He likes to meddlein other people's business,     but he's slow as hell, so they got him.    Guys like him just get in the way...    That's why I said I was going it alone.    You bastard...    He saved your life. How dare you...    I am sick of it!    Having people up and die on me...    Polnareff...    I'm so sick of it, you hear me!    He's got a bold face,and yet he d*ed so easily.    Come to think of it,she was really good at sobbing...    Your sister, that is.    Are you telling me to hold back?    Don't fall for the enemy's provocation!    Mr. Avdol told younot to fight by yourself!
02x11 - The Emperor and the Hanged Man, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:32For such a tough guy,he sure was easy to finish off.  Then again, the end is usuallya pretty sudden curtain call.   Most folks don't get a chanceto say "goodbye," you know.  Think of thatas a little parting wisdom...  Polnareff!  You can't let him get to you!  Do you still not get it?  Mr. Avdol told you!  He begged you not to fight alone!   But you ignored him...   He feared you'd gladly end your own life,   if it meant getting revenge!   Mr. Avdol followed you hereout of worry, and now he's gone!   So what am I supposed to do?   We need to fall back for now.   He mercilessly stabbed Avdol in the back.   He k*lled my defenseless sister.   You expect me to forgetall this happened and run?   We can't fight them when we don'tknow what their Stands can do!    Don't fight a battle that willonly end in your death!    That's what Mr. Avdolwas trying to tell you!   Hey! Come on, li'l Pol Pol.   Why, you...   Polnareff! Slowly retreat toward me.   We'll take that truck!   Calm down you say?   All ri...   Hey, Polnareff.    EPISODE   : THE EMPERORAND THE HANGED MAN, PART TWO    Avdol d*ed for you.   I think that means you owe him.   Your friend bit the dust, because of you.   You bastard.   Where's the user?   Polnareff, calm down!   No need to be sad. You should be happy...   You're about to seeyour dear friend again.   You'll soon be dead,   enjoying the afterlifewith those two fools.   Your sisterwas so very sweet, Polnareff...   Once you're reunited withyour sister, be sure to ask her:   exactly how I m*rder*d her!   Polnareff, don't fall for his tricks!   He wants you to att*ck!   Bastard!   Your Chariot cannot cut my Hanged Man.   I'm in the mirror,where your Stand can't go.   That's why!   So close, and yet so far away!   Hol Horse. Fire away.Let's put an end to this idiot.   Aye aye, sir.   Die!   Emerald Splash!   What the...   Wait? He sh*t...   ...Polnareff!   Kakyoin, was it? Not bad.   That's out of my Stand's range.   Even if I got him,   the b*llet wouldn't do much damage.   Mr. Centerfold went after them, eh?   He must really have it in for Polnareff.   Sorry, Kakyoin.   I...   I thought, so long as I couldavenge my sister,   I wouldn't care if I live or d*ed.   But I understand now...   I know Avdol was fighting for me.   His sacrifice won't be for naught.   I'll fight to keep on living.   You sure you really mean that?   Yes.   You can think of that asa makeup handshake, Polnareff.   Right. Thank you, Kakyoin.   When those bastards come after us again,   we'll defeat them together.   Avdol, you...   You know, I was so sureI stabbed him with my sword.   But it didn't connect.   It was like he wasn't there.   Breaking the mirror didn't stop him.   The Hanged Man,just att*cked from the shards.   He att*cks your reflectionfrom within the mirror.   My Stand can't go inside mirrors...   How can we att*ck him if he'sin some kind of mirror world?   Damn it!   Polnareff, you keep talking about   "inside the mirror"and "the mirror world,"   but there's no such thingas a world in a mirror.   Remember, this is reality, not fantasy.   What are you talking about?You saw it, too, didn't you?   You can see him only in a mirror,   and when you turn around, he's gone!   Yes.   But a mirror reflects light. Nothing more.   I know how a mirror works!   Listen! I mean in this case.Like what's going on right now.   If Stands can exist,then so can a mirror world!   Wrong.    Come on, man!    The secret of the Hanged Man    has something to do withthe way mirrors work.    Stands can defeat other Stands,    so there still has to be somethingwe don't know about his—    Polnareff!The chrome of the steering wheel!    What?    He's caught up to us!    Look out!    You all right, Kakyoin?    I slammed my chest, but I'll be fine.    What?    Chariot!    Kakyoin!Get away from anything reflective!    Damn it... I got it. I just saw him do it.    From mirror to mirror!    From reflection to reflection!    He's jumping from one object to another!    He traveled all this way    by reflecting over and over!    Reflecting?    So he's actually light!    A light-based Stand?    Kakyoin! I just saw himin the car's bumper!    He'll reflect off itand into something else.    Stay clear of reflective stuff!    And take off anything that's shiny!    Your buttons!    Hey, Mister, are you guys okay?    Want me to bring some medicine?    Hey! Kid! It's dangerous, Get out of here!    Whoa,you guy's really messed up your car...    Hey, you're bleeding, mister.    What?    Are you sure you're okay?    That assh*le!    He reflected into the kid's eye!    Listen, kid. Don't look at us.    Huh?    I told you, don't look at us!    Stop looking at me! sh*t!    Huh? But you're hurt.    I'm fine! See? Perfectly fine!    So go look over there!    You're bleeding...    Look over there, you brat!    Damn you, Centerfold!    What to do?    You wouldn't poke outthis cute little boy's eye    with that sword of yours,would you, Polnareff?    Polnareff!    I finally got you.    You won't escape this time.    Unless, of course,you gouge the kid's eye out.    You dirty little...    You'll pay for this!    Hey, Kakyoin.    That's not what you sayat a time like this.    Listen!    In times such as these,    exacting revenge requiresan altogether different battle cry.    My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.    For the honor of my sister's soul,    so that my friend Avdol may rest in peace,    into the pits of despair,    I shall strike you down, Centerfold!    Sorry bout this, kid!I'll buy you any candy you want!    You got sand in my eye!    Polnareff, he's in your eye...    I don't understand how,    but he moves at almost the speed of light.    A normally indiscernible speed, yes,    but I knew that if the kidclosed his eyes,    his next move would be to my eye.    I see...    The Hanged Man can existonly in the world of reflections.    When one world is about to be destroyed,    he must migrateto another reflective object.    So...    Knowing his pathmakes slicing through him...    a piece of cake!    That's where he is... The user!    You bastard. Finally...    Finally!    At last we meet...    Centerfold!    My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff,    and I've seen throughyour Stand's clever little trick.    It's a Stand of light that movesat extraordinary speed.    Too fast to target with my eyes.    But if I know where you're going,    and I slash its trajectory in that moment,    I can cut you!    If Kakyoin and Avdol hadn't shown up,    I probably wouldn't have figured that out,    and you would have k*lled me.    Polnareff! He's not the manwith two right hands!    That's not Centerfold!    What?    Polnareff!    EMPERORHOL HORSE    Polnareff!    Over here.    Insignificant fools!    I'm Centerfold.    You...    That's just some beggar from the village.    All I did was carve him up a bit,just like you did to me.    And you fell for it!    Getting close to him withoutknowing what I look like    was a grave mistake!    You bastard!    Take this! Emerald...    Whoa. Wait now.    Take a good look around you.    Hey, gather 'round!    These two gentleman are handing out money!    What?    They'll give us money for nothing!    Thank you!    You have such big hearts!    Thank you! Thank you!    Thank you!    Please give us money!    Have you figured out what's going on yet?    You say you've figured out my Stand?    Fool!    You think I don't know my own weakness?    With myriad reflective surfaces,you'll never know my next move.    I have no weakness!    Don't look! Don't stare at us!    Just look away!    There's no escape.    Just going to blow everyone up?    You wasted your youth chasing me...    And now, to come so far only to fail!    How pathetic and sad.    I, Centerfold,    will live on surrounded bybeauties like your sister    Oh the pleasures that await!    Oh yeah, that sweet sister of yourswas really good at sobbing...    Farewell.    Why, you...    Polnareff, you can do better than that.    When taking revenge,words like "Why, you..." won't do.    Here's what you say:    My name is Noriaki Kakyoin.    To avenge my dear friend, Avdol,    and so that the soul ofmy friend Polnareff's sister    may rest in peace,    I will have you pay with your life.    I'll give this gold cointo whoever picks it up.    Behold, a coin so perfect,it shines like a mirror!    Now I get it, Kakyoin.    Seems everyone's eyesare now focused on a single point.    Yeah.    We know the trajectorythe Hanged Man will have to take!    Merci, Kakyoin!    Now!    Hold it!    It won't open!    Sounds like you're the one who'sreally good at sobbing, Centerfold!    And you're about to plummet into hell,    crying the whole way down.    But there's one thing I can't relyon the guardians of hell to do.    And that's...    To turn your body into a pincushion!    I've been waiting years for this moment!    I'll leave the rest to the devil.    So this is the true Hanged Man...    He was rotten to the core.    I got my revenge.    HANGED MANCENTERFOLD    Hold it!    Finally caught up with you.    Why are you walking so slow?    If you're gonna run,run like your lives depend on it.    Right, Mr. Centerfold?    Better say your prayers.    This is where your lives come to an end!    Come at us with everything you've got!    Show us your guts, boys!    Right, Mr. Centerfold?    Hey, are you listening, Mr. Centerfold?    I don't thinkhe's listening anymore, cowboy.    He's a little busy right now...    Carrying out his sentence in hell!    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!    Don't try to pull that nonsense!Bluffing won't work on me!    There's no way you could have b*at him!    Even I wouldn't try my luckagainst that mother!    Polnareff,your sense of humor really stinks.    'Two, three hundred meters that way,    is that bastard's corpse...    'case you wanna look.    Don't mind if I do!    Hey! You're running away?    I don't stand a chance!    I'm outnumbered!    Time to hightail it out of hereand wait for a better chance!    Or better yet, wait 'til I findmyself another partner in crime.    It's all about being Number Two!    That's the motto I like to live by!    Got a problem with that?    What?    Mr. Joestar! Jotaro!    We know about Avdol.    We didn't have time for much,but we gave him a proper burial.    The one who stabbed Mr. Avdol in the back    was that coward with two right hands.    But the cause of deathwas Hol Horse's b*llet.    What should we do with him?    I'll give him his sentence.    Death!    What?    Please run, Sir Hol Horse!    -Sir Hol Horse!-What's with this woman?    I don't know what's going on,    but I do know I'll always protect you!    You are my everything, darling!    Please run! Hurry!    Let go of me, stupid bitch!    Come on, what are you doing?    Jotaro! Kakyoin!Don't let Hol Horse get away!    It's too late.    Huh? Oh...    Well said, my little sweetheart!    I'll gladly accept your feelingsand keep on living!    I'm only running awaybecause I love you, baby!    Forever and ever!    Why, you...    Get back here!    Agh...    Oh, don't you dare "Agh" at me!    Polnareff, the girl is justanother one of his victims.    And he no longer hadany intention of fighting with us.    We have no time to deal with him.    Avdol is gone now.    But we have to forge ahead.    It's already been fifteen dayssince we left Japan.    Damn it...    Fine then.    All right! We continue onward to Egypt.    Listen up! To defeat Dio,we have to fight as one.    We can't go off on our own!    Or we'll play right intothe enemy's hands.    Got it?    Let's get a move on!    Good grief.    The city of Varanasi is coming into view.    m*rder*r!    I am the culprit!    I am Joseph Joestar! An American!    What?    I love you.    Hey... Doesn't that sort oflook like a person's face?
02x12 - The EmpressQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:33My son has been m*rder*d...  I can sense the misfortune thathas befallen my son, Centerfold.  The bond between motherand son has spoken!  My precious, beautiful boy...  You d*ed covered with wounds like this?  I can feel it.I suffer the same pain you felt.  You were magnificent as you foughtfor LordDio, my dear Centerfold!  How...  How did they do it?   To k*ll such a nobleand pure soul like you...   They must have done something underhanded.   Damn them!   The bastards!   I will make sure they paya terrifying price   with the Empress card!   Move!   This is a time for action...   With the Stand that brings a slow death!   Oh, the anguish!   I shall k*ll them all!    VARANASI, CALCUTTAINDIA   Jojo and crew head tothe sacred city of Varanasi.   Listen...    I don't usually get ona soap box like this...   But stupid people are just that.   You can repeat something a million times,   and they still won't listen.   You know the type, right?   There's just no helping the poor souls.   But you know, uh...   I never got your name...   Nena.   Nena! That's a great name.   Daughter of that wealthy Varanasian family   from around here, right?   You're good-looking,and I can tell your smart, too.   I have an eye for people,which leads me to my point...   Hol Horse is a horrible, lying bastard.   He's manipulating you!Think how your parents would feel.   You hear me?   You can't end up like this.   I know it's easy when you're in love.   But you can't afford to seethe world with such a narrow view.   Take a step back andlook at the whole picture.   Hey, we're almost there.   The city of Varanasi.   The sacred river, the Ganges.   A place for holy men,the young and the old, the sick.   Where cows, dogs, monkeys,and food for human consumption,   lie alongside excrementand corpses for cremation...   The river embraces all,its waters ever flowing.   From birth unto death,   its holy waters form a microcosm of life.   Visitors of Varanasiare said to remain transfixed,   never wanting to leave.   Perhaps the landscape   that is this sacred landis a window unto soul.   Man... This thing isn'tgetting any better.   What's wrong, old man?You don't look so good.   Looks like my bug bite got infected.   It's definitely swollen.   I think you should see a doctorbefore it gets worse.   Hey, doesn't that sort oflook like a person's face?   Stop kidding around, Polnareff.   Sorry 'bout that.   Shall I go to the hospital with you?   No! Stop treating melike a feeble old man.   I'll just lance this.   Huh? What'd you say?   It's definitely infected.   It'll worsen, if we don't drain the fluid.   Hey, hey, hey.   Can't we just put medicine anda bandage on it, and call it a day?   Not to worry.   We'll numb the area, so it won't hurt.   No problem. No problem at all.   Come now, lie down.   I studied medicine in England.   I can do appendectomies, too.   Uh-oh. It's a little rusty.   Well, no problem.   All right.   Let's slice it open.   Come on!   I don't want to watch it being cut open.   No problem.   Hey, are you done?   Is it over yet?   What?   Hey, Doctor!   Trying to cut me open?   That's a pretty stupid move, you old fart!   What the hell is this?   I'm the Empress,   as in the Empress card, Old Man Joseph!   And now, I'm gonna bloody you up good!   When'd you get on me? Damn it!   This thing's got teeth!   Damn it's strong!    No, it grabbed the scalpel!    Oh, no!    Thank goodness it got my artificial hand.    Bastard! Think you can just cut me?    I'm part of your body now, Old Man Joseph.    You can't get away from me, honey.    Bet I can guess what's goingthrough that thick skull of yours...    Probably something like...    Only a Stand can defeat another Stand.    My Stand, Hermit Purple,has the power of clairvoyance    and remote viewing.    How can I fight with that?    How can I defeat somethingthat's growing out of my own arm?    You can't!    Where's the user?    How the hell did you infect me?    You moron! I won't tell!    Disgusting freak!    Running off to your friends?    We'll see how that goes.    Doctor, your next patient is waiting...    Doctor...!    Hey! Let me explain!    -I didn't do it, I...-I k*lled him!    I'm Joseph Joestar! An American!    And I'm staying at Hotel Clarks!    What?    By the way, girlie.    I have a thing forhot young nurses like yourself.    What?    m*rder*r!    Wait! You got it all wrong!    Oh, no...    Now you can't go back to the hotel.    You're all alone now!    I can k*ll you without anyone interfering!    You little...!    I'll crush you to tiny bits!    What?    Hey, this is your arm.    Take care of it, you shitty old man.    It grew arms? How much more could it grow?    Hey! Let go of it!    What are you doing? Let go!    Not a chance!    Officer! The m*rder's over here!    He's right here!    It's been a while since it came to this...    Hey! What are you doing?    Overdrive!    Moron!    It's your arm, remember?    You think your Hamon wouldwork against your own body?    You! Don't move!    Then how about...Hermit Purple!    You're crushing me...    I can use it this way, too!    I told you, freeze!    Stop! Criminal!    Damn it!    What are you doing? I can't see!    Now what?     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    So as I was saying, Nena...    Real men don't have to talk a big game.    That's how you figure out who's a liar    and who's the genuine article.    Damn cops've run mein the wrong direction.    I'm nowhere near the hotel now.    Had I known this would happen,    I would've taken Polnareff with me.    Instead of a petty guylike Hol Horse, how about me?    Am I not your type?    I don't dwell on the past.    I don't care whom you used to date.    What's important is the future.    We just need to understand each other.    Oh, look over there.    That place is a hotel run bya Japanese woman named Kumiko.    -She manages it-Out of the way.    -with her Indian husband.-Out of the way.    We could probably stay for cheap.    Oh, really?    Tell me more about this hotel.    Wha...    What the hell are you doing?    I'm eating, Joestar.    I've got to grow up big and strong.    You stole those at the market!You quick little bastard.    Why, you...    Look how big I've gotten!    It's tough having another mouthto feed isn't it, Daddy...    You disgusting little cow!    I'll show you that nobody...    has the experience or the smarts totake down the great Joseph Joestar!    Now how the hell am I going to do that?    Damn it...    Here goes nothing... Hermit Purple!    Oh, Daddy Dearest,    you know I appreciateall your tender loving care.    But you shouldn't tie your children down.    One day, you have tolet them leave the nest!    Oh, no!    It's no use.    I could use Hermit Purple'sremote viewing to find the User,    but I need a camera!    What can I do?    At this rate... it won't be just my arm.    She'll take over my entire body!    I've already grown enoughto end your pathetic life!    See? I can reach your throat.    I just have to bust your carotid artery,    and you're done for.    Oh, no!    What's he doing?    Bastard!    What in the...?    Look!    That man has a verystrange growth on his arm!    Dammit! Where the hell's the Stand user?    Polnareff, sir...    I need a reliable man like youto take care of me.    I love you... Such a strong,trustworthy man you are.    Uh, but it's all so sudden.    Is she serious?    I think I'm falling in love!    Lucky!    Hey, Joseph Joestar.    You idiot.    You getting farther and fartherfrom Jotaro and the others.    You think I'm running my ass offjust for the hell of it?    I'm running so I can shut you up for good!    See that?    You're going in for a nice long soak!    Senile old fool!    A nail?    I picked it up earlier.    When you were rolling aroundon the ground like an idiot.    Now I can cut shove itright into your carotid!    Did you actually believe I'd suffocate    if you stuck me in here?    Die!    I may be made of your flesh,but I'm not alive like you!    Forget the rules already?    Only a Stand can defeat a Stand.    Oh yeah,    weren't you going to show meall that fighting experience?    Am I supposed to be impressed?    You're nothing but a pathetic old man!    My prosthetic hand...    It almost broke when she hit it earlier...    It's got no power!    Just one more push...    Your life as an invalidis about to come to an end.    There's no way you can defeat me...    Huh?    Not a single way...    What?    Not a single what?    I'm sorry, my hearingisn't what it used to be.    Run that by me one more time, will ya?    Coal tar!    You stuck me in tar?    It wasn't to suffocate me!    You were trying to keep me from moving!    But...    How'd you know there wascoal tar in there?    With my Stand's power,Hermit Purple told me everything!    Hey, everyone look...    What is this?    That foreigner must've made itwhen he spilled the incense ashes...    They've formed a perfect map of the city!    You used psychic photography!    That's how you found the tar!    You "developed" a picture in the incense!    The difference in our fighting experience    should be as clear as day now!    When your opponent starts boastinghe's already lost.    That's how Joseph Joestar does things.    Like a fine wine,I guess I just get better with age.    Now...    It's time to rip off this Standwith my Stand!    Next you'll say,"Please, stop it, I beg you!"    Please, stop it, I beg you!    This will hurt me as much as it hurts you.    But children can't dependon their parents forever.    Once you've grown up,    you gotta learn to live on your own!    Now then...where's this thing's Stand user?    Well, then, Nena...    Shall we seal our new love with a kiss?    What? What? What the hell?    What's wrong, Nena?    So she was The Empress's Stand user...    Huh?    Huh?    This ugly troll...    attached her Stand to meas a tumor with a human face,    and camouflaged herselfas a beautiful woman.    You were careless.    She played you likea damn fiddle, Polnareff.    EMPRESS NENA    And here I thought we'd finallybe able to sleep in a bed.    If the old man hadn't screwed up,    we wouldn't be out herehiding from the cops.    I took care of things.    We can take this car.    Polnareff, you're driving.    Hey, don't tell me you're still in shock.    The Stand att*cked me, remember?    I'd rather have gone through that...    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    So, we're finally leaving India.    Well, I am a girl.    Did you see the driver's face?    More trouble would be especially bad now.    A truck? Impossible...    By the way...do you like sumo?
02x13 - Wheel of FortuneQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:33Now with a new set of wheels,  Jojo and crew leavethe holy city of Varanasi  for Pakistan.  We're about to hitthe Indo-Pakistani border...  I guess it's time tosay good bye to India.  You know, I had mixed feelingsabout the country at first,  but now I sorta miss the hustleand bustle of Calcutta,  and frenetic chaos of the Ganges.  One day, I'll be back.   I owe it to Avdolto give him a proper burial.   Mr. Avdol...   The road's getting narrower.   Quit clogging up the road! Outta the way!   I'm gonna pass him!   Polnareff, calm down!   This four-wheel drive is great!   Hey, did you just flinga bunch of rocks into that car?   Yeah? Your point?   Another incidentis the last thing we need right now.   I'm wanted becauseof what happened in Varanasi.   I'd like to cross the border in one piece.   What now, Polnareff?   I just told you!We can't afford another mishap!   I know that!Look who's standing over there!   Good grief...   Hey! We meet again.   How 'bout a ride?    I mean, come on, I'm a girl.    Soon I'll be wearing a bra,and doing my nails for the boys.   I'd look pathetic wandering aroundthe world when I'm that age.   It's now or never! The time is now!   To see the world... To be free...   Don't ya think?   Look, I feel bad for lying aboutgoing to see my dad in Singapore,   but let's just forget that.   Hey, it's the car we passed.   Guess he's in a hurry now.   Let him pass.   Yeah...   Hey, now!   What's he trying to do?   I let you pass,now hurry up and go already!   He's probably mad fromyour little maneuver earlier.   Catch the driver's face?   Nope... Windows were covered in dust.   Couldn't see a thing.   Me neither...   It couldn't be...   Be careful, Polnareff.   Now he wants me to pass!   Looks like he realizedhow shitty that piece of junk is.   Should've just stayed behind me, dumbass!   What?   A truck? No!   We're stuck! We're gonna crash!   Star Platinum!   That was close!   Without Star Platinum,we'd have been toast.   He's gone! Where'd that blasted car go?   Looks like he drove off.   What do you think?   Think that bastard in the caris an enemy Stand user?   Or some sick bastard with an axe to grind?   Of course he's one of Dio's lackeys!   We were almost road k*ll, for God's sake!   But he didn't att*ck withanything that resembled a Stand.   Regardless,we have to keep heading to the border.   If we see that car again,we'll take him out, whoever he is!   Damn straight.   What should we do about that truck?   Star Platinum left it a wreck.It won't be going anywhere.   We pretend we never saw it.Now let's get going.   He's so cool... and dreamy...    SYRIA   A roadside tea stand...   A break would do us some good.   If we stick around here a while,we should lose that crazy driver.   What is that stuff?   Sugarcane juice.   Care for a glass?   Might as well...   What?   It's him!   That car's here!   You! I've got a question!   The driver of that clunker over there...   Who is it?   Um, I'm not sure, sir.I didn't notice it there, sir...   Our driver won't just come outand announce it.   He's messing with us!   Then I guess that leaves uswith one option. Right, Jotaro?   Yeah...   Poor innocent bastards...   We'll just have to b*at them all down!   Hey, Jotaro, stop!   Mr. Joestar, not you too? This is crazy!   Pretty suspicious mug you got there...   What? Not me!   Slippery bastard just playedthe lot of us, didn't he?    Anyone see his face?    No. What is he trying to do?    He could be some madman with a car,or he could be trying to k*ll us.    I won't rest until I catch himand get to the bottom of this!    And I'm still pissedabout what that truck did to us!    Damn it! For a piece of junk,that car can really get up and go!    That's strange.    According to the map,    we should be running parallelwith train tracks here.    Who the hell cares?    We'll catch up soon anyway.    That bastard!    I'm gonna nail himonce we round this curve!    A dead end! That's impossible!    Where the hell did he go? He's gone!    It's like he just disappeared!    There's no way he crossedthe suspension bridge...    What?    It's him!    He keeps ramming us!    How'd he get behind us?    How much horsepower isthat piece of junk running with?    It's like a t*nk!    It's no use! Everyone, get out of the car!    Polnareff!    You can't get out untilthe rest of us are clear first!    Who'll hold down the brake?    Huh?    Sorry!    Hierophant Green!    Stop!    Hierophant can't supportthis kind of weight!    You'll be torn to shreds!    Mr. Joestar, with all due respect,I am aware of my own abilities.    I am not a fool.    You took the winch with you!    Not bad, Kakyoin.    So tell me, you like sumo?    Especially deadlocksat the edge of the ring...?    Exciting, isn't it?    Ow...    Yeah, I'm a fan of sumo.    But Jotaro, it's against the rulesto punch your opponent.     STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Nothing here suggestshe used a Stand att*ck.    I think it's safe to sayhe's just some weirdo.    Yeah. Either way,he's a goner after that fall.    Well... What goes around comes around.    Yeah, but I still wonder...    How'd it get behind us?    It's so strange.    It's not strange at all...    The radio!    He's coming through the AM/FM!    It was able to do thatbecause it's my Stand, Joestar!    What?    If he knows my name,    then he's got to be an enemy Stand user!    Where is he?    He's sending a signalfrom the car down there?    No way! You see that wreck?    No. That old jalopycould very well be a Stand.    Remember the boat Stand?This could be just like Strength.    Behold the Wheel of Fortune...    My Stand will lead you to your maker!    The Wheel of Fortune?    What the... An earthquake?    I've got a bad feeling...    Everyone, get in the car!    No, don't!    Don't go anywhere near it!    Couldn't be...    Below us!    Impossible! It burrowed upthrough the ground!    If that's not proof enoughthe car's a Stand, nothing is!    The Stand's user must be inside!    What the hell?    What is that thing?    It's like it's alive!    It's transforming for an att*ck!    Want to see who's stronger?    Don't, Jotaro. Don't fight it yet!    Not until we knowwhat that Stand's power is!    Jotaro!    Impossible... I couldn't see it.    The hell'd he sh**t at me?    Don't know what hit ya, eh?    You'll figure it out soon enough...    The moment you croak, that is!    Jotaro!    Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!    The hell is this?    They're not deep,but they sting like hell!    I couldn't see it.    He's sh**ting something at us,but our wounds...    I don't see anything in our wounds!    Are you all right, Jotaro?    Don't worry bout me. First things first...    I don't know what he's sh**ting,but he's got damn good aim.    I'll pulverize your legsso you can't move,    then run you over!    Quick! Between the rocks!    Stop skittering away, cowards!    -What?-What are you? Roaches?    Oh no! He's digging his way through!    We're no match for him in here!    He's like an insanemeathead who's lost control    cause he couldn't figure outsome kiddie puzzle!    Keep running!    They all left me behind!    So I'm a runaway!    So I'm a good-for-nothing kid!No one loves me! I'm always alone!    I'm gonna die!    Good grief.    If you have time to say all that crap,    you can run away, little brat.    I love you so much, Jotaro!    Go ahead and climb!    There's no path left for you to take!    No way to escape,no way to survive, no way to Egypt,    and last but not least, no future!    Because...    This Wheel of Fortune    is going to grind you into mincemeat    and splatter you all over these boulders!    Oh, no!    It's climbing up...    Is there anything this car can't do?    Good grief.    Guess we have no choice but to fight.    Everyone, get back.    Once he climbs up here,his undercarriage'll be exposed.    We'll see how strong it is then.    I get it.    Its undersidemight be vulnerable to att*ck!    You're pretty fast there, Jotaro!    But not too bright!    Your bodies reek,and you haven't even noticed!    Come to think of it,I think I did smell gasoline!    It's coming from us!    We're covered in gas!    It was sh**ting...    gasoline!    It was sh**ting small amounts of itat high speed, like b*ll*ts.    Incredible...    He wasn't trying to wound us.    He was dousing our bodies with gasoline!    Looks like you finally caught on,but it's too late!    Now all you need is a little jolt!    What?    Jotaro!    Jotaro!    Mr. Joestar, stay back!    We're soaked with gasoline, too.    Jotaro!    I win! Part Three ends here!    Oh?    Then who'll be taking the placeof the one and only Jotaro Kujo?    Don't tell me you think it'd be you.    You burrowed into the groundwith Star Platinum!    So the only thing that b*rned upwas your jacket?    A little parting wisdom:What you said earlier about paths...    was dead wrong.    You see, in life,you have to forge your own path.    Let Jotaro Kujo show you how it's done.    All you need is a little push!    I'm being crushed...    Jotaro!    And that's how it's done.    Your body paved a nice path.    You literally made a road with it.    Here ends the lesson.    What an odd fellow.    His arms are the size of boulders,    and yet everything else is so small.    Talk about a bluff.    Hey! Going somewhere?    Don't k*ll me!I'm just in this for the money!    Oh, God.    I can't believe the Stand wasdisguising such a small car.    Kind of reminds me of    a fluffy little sheepthat's just been shorn.    How pathetic.    I AM A MONK IN THE MIDSTOF SPIRITUAL TRAINING.     RESPECT MY ASCETIC PRACTICEBY NOT UNDOING MY RESTRAINTS    Well, then. Let's take this caracross the border.    Only fair since he smashed ours.    It's pretty b*at-up.I wonder if it'll last that long.    Help!    And you're on the next flightto Hong Kong.    Aw, why?    Shut up! You're in the way,don't you get it?    We might not make it that far...    Help!     WHEEL OF FORTUNEZII ZII    My seven assassins have all been defeated.    The shame!    I cannot bear to face Lord Dio.    Curses! That despicable Polnareff!Kakyoin!    Curse Jotaro and his wretched grandfather!    I, Enyaba, shall be your nextand final opponent!    I will fight with my own Stand,the Justice card!    The fog is getting worse from over there.    They d*ed with that look of fearon their face!    Why is that?    What is with everyone in this town?    This isn't an ordinary m*rder.    Joestar and company.    You seem to be travelers.    Assalam alaikum.
02x14 - Justice, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:34Oh my, that looks quite good on you!  In all my years,  I've never received sucha strange request for clothing.  I'm in a hurry. What's the total?  See ya.  Uh, thank you, sir...  Let go! Let go of me!  And don't you dare touch me there!  -Shut up! Don't say it like that!-Here's her ticket.   No! I don't wanna!   I'm going with you guys!   Listen, Little Miss.   My daughter, Jotaro's mother...   is in grave danger at the moment.   We're on this journeyto save my daughter's life.   Forget this running away business,and start heading home.   I'm sure your parents are worried sick.   There.   Fine, I guess so.   I'll make you look goodthis time, Grandpa.   What's the matter?   Nothing.   See ya! Life is justa bunch of goodbyes anyway!   I do sort of wish I could'veseen him once more.   Goodbye, Jojo! You better save your mom!   I'll be rooting for you!   Pakistan is a young country,established in        following its separation from India.   But when Japan was stilla hunter-gatherer society,   Pakistan was the seatof a highly developed civilization.   Here in Pakistan, the people carry on   the     -year historyof the Indian subcontinent.    EPISODE   : JUSTICE, PART ONE    I gotta say, Jotaro, I'm impressed you got   a Japanese school uniformmade here in Pakistan.   The fit is perfect, too.   It's    % wool.   Polnareff, are you ok driving?   The fog seems to be thickening.   Yeah, I guess it is kinda dangerous.   With no guard rail on this cliffand all...   Hmm...The fog looks even thicker up ahead.   It's not even  :   yet,but I guess we have no choice.   Let's stop in that town for the night.   I wonder if they've got nice hotels.   A nice hotel, huh?   Right. And it'd better havea decent bathroom!   I still can't get used to those toilets   in India and Western Asia.   Was that a dead dog?   What's the matter, Jotaro?   Oh, it was nothing.   Not a bad town.   There must be at leasta few thousand people living here.   Let's ask about a hotelat that restaurant there.   But there's a weird quietabout this place...   Every other place has beenso crowded and noisy.   It's probably the fog.   Listen up, men.   In the Islamic countries west of Pakistan,   this is how you greet people.   First, you smile and say...   A-Salaam-Alaikum!   Um, hehe... No need toclose up shop just for us.   We just wanted to ask a question.Are there any hotels here in town?   Anybody home?   I do not know.   Huh?   Hey, wait a minute.Whaddya mean, you don't know?   What's with that guy...?   I must've been seeing things.   I'm sure he couldn't understand you   because your pronunciation's so bad.   Let's ask the guy over there.   Sorry, but we're looking fora hotel around here.   Preferably a hotelwith nice, clean bathrooms.   Do you know any...   Hey, you!   What's wrong?   What?   He's dead! His face is frozen in fear!   What's going on?   Why is he lying dead in the road?   What could've k*lled him?   A heart att*ck? A stroke?   It's possible...   But what we've got hereis no ordinary heart failure.   A g*n! This guy is holding a g*n...   You just noticed?   It's still smoking. He just fired it.   He must've just fired it.Maybe two to five minutes ago.   Either way, it must've beenright before we arrived in town.   Could it be su1c1de?Think he sh*t himself?   No, I doubt it.   His body doesn't seem to haveany visible wounds...   and there's no blood anywhere.   Then how'd this guy die? Look at him!   His face is all twisted,   like he was screaming in utter terror!    I don't know.    Exactly who or what did this mansh**t at with this g*n?    What happened?    Didn't anyone in town noticewhat was happening?    Excuse me, ma'am.    Someone has d*ed here!Please call the police!    You must excuse me.    My boils, they are infected.    Did you say you need something?    I asked you to call the police!    The police?    But why?    Look! That man's dead!    Oh dear, someone is dead you say?    Is there anything I can do?    I already asked you to call the police!    Yes, yes, call the police...    Of course.    My boils are infected.    They are so itchy. So terribly itchy...    What is with the people in this town?    A man is lying dead in the street,    and nobody seemsthe slightest bit concerned.    There was a g*nsh*t, and no one noticed?    These people are more oblivious thanthe most jaded New Yorker or Tokyoite.    That dog...    This blasted fog just keepsgetting thicker and thicker.    It's almost as if the fog hasswallowed the town whole.    This's really creepy.    Doesn't that part there look like a skull?    What do you want to do, old man?    You don't think it's the workof another Stand user, do you?    Probably not. There's no motive.    Would someone who's after us    k*ll a man who has nothing to do with us,    before we even got here?    There's no reason fora Stand user to k*ll him.    Who knows...He obviously d*ed unnaturally.    We can examine the bodybefore the police come.    Just don't touch it.    Right...    Looks like he was traveling, too,just like us.    He has bus and train tickets.    And he looks like he might be Indian.    He's carrying Indian money.    I'm guessing he's not from this town.    Oh?    A wound!    There's an opening the size ofa ten-yen coin under his throat!    This must be what k*lled him.    But why isn't there any blood?    With a wound this large,blood should be everywhere.    Normally, at least.    This is no ordinary m*rder.    We've got to get to the bottom of this.    But first things first.    Take off his clothes.    What happened to his body?    It's riddled with holes!    He looks like the cartoon cheeseon Tom & Jerry!    And there's not a drop of bloodnear any of these wounds.    How do you even k*ll someone like that?    What does all this mean?    Be careful.    If there wasn't a Stand user here before,you can bet there's one here now.    Everyone!    Get in the car!We're leaving this place now!    What?    Impossible!    This isn't the car!    Hermit Purple!    Hey. Old man.    What in the hell are you doing?You've lost it?    Oh, no!    What am I doing?    The car was right here just a minute ago!    What? The car?    We just parked over there.    What?    But just now...    I see you are travelers.    I'm afraid with this fog,    it's too dangerous to leave town now.    We have many cliffs, you know.    I run my own bed and breakfast.    If you'd like,why not stay there for the night?    I'll even give you a healthy discount.    Finally, a normal person!     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    We must assume a Stand useris hiding somewhere in this town.    This fog puts usat a significant disadvantage.    We cannot let our guard down tonight.    I realize no one's att*cked us yet,but, damn, this town is creepy.    Come on, this way, Master Joestar.That's my hotel.    Follow me,and I'll lead you to your rooms.    I know it doesn't look like much...but twenty years ago,    one of the     movies was filmed here,    and John Lennon from the Beatlesonce stayed here as well.    What? Seriously?    No, I was just pulling your leg.    -What?-Still,    it is quite a nice hotel,if I do say so myself.    We don't have any other guestsat the moment,    so you can choose the dinner menu.    Care for meat?    -Or would you prefer fish?-Hold it, Grandma.    You called me "Joestar," didn't you?    How'd you know that name?    Come now,    that young man beside you said"Mr. Joestar" earlier.    What? Me?    Now that I think about it, maybe I did.    Yes, you did, sir.    When you've been in this businessfor as many years as I have,    you learn to memorizepeople's names quickly.    So I'm sure of it.    By the way, Ma'am,what happened to your left hand?    Oh, this? It's just a little burn...    It must be my old age.    I accidentally spilledboiling water on it.    Old age? Don't be silly.    You hardly look a day over forty.    I should ask you on a date.    Don't tease an old woman now.    You damn, babbling, pathetic fool!    It is you I despise most, Polnareff!    I'll make sure you suffer a pain    a thousand times worsethan what my son endured.    Then I'll cut off your d*ck    and rip out your guts to finish you off!    Oh, this doesn't look bad at all.    Here, Kakyoin.    Right.    My autograph's worth    as much as Lennon's.I'm Paul-nareff, after all!    Make sure you take good care of it.    My, my...    I will do just that.    To commemorate the day I m*rder you!    It's done.    Well, then...Allow me to show you to your rooms.    Man... Talk about a weird town.    Now, time to hit the loo.    It must be broken.    Then I won't be able to use Hermit Purple    to get info on the enemy...    Hey, Mr. Joestar.    What's the matter?    Does this room have a bathroom?    Looks like mine doesn't have one.    Perhaps the bathrooms here are communal.    Ah, of course!    Good grief. He's so carefree.    A Stand user could att*ck at any moment...    So, the Joestar partyis on the third floor?    Hol Horse... So, you've come.    Yeah, I finally tracked those bastards    as far as this creepy town.    But finding you is a surprise, Enyaba.    I didn't expect youto fight them yourself.    What's the matter, Enyaba?    Why're you crying?    I'm just happy, Hol Horse!    It means so much that you're here!    Thank you for comingto see this lonely old woman!    It is so wonderful to finally see you!    Hol Horse, you and my sonwere friends, were you not?    Friends?    Uh, well, I...    Ahem...    Yes, we were thick as thieves.    So you were close?    Close?    Yeah, he was a dear friendand an excellent partner!    What's all this about?You're not acting like yourself.    Will you avenge my son?Is that why you're here?    Yes! That's exactly it!    I'm gonna make sure those bastardspay for k*lling my best friend!    That's exactly what I want to hear!    Because now I can k*ll you too!    Enyaba? What the hell are you doing?    How dare you, Hol Horse?    You abandoned my sonand left him for dead!    I swore I would k*ll youthe moment I saw you again!    His "best friend"? How dare you?    Wait! You've got it all wrong!    By the time I got there,Centerfold was already a goner!    You wretch! You're as unforgivableas that bastard, Polnareff!    I'll have you die at the handsof my Stand, Justice!    Justice?    I'm sure you heard rumors,but I doubt you've ever seen it!    I shall show you right now, Hol Horse!    What the hell is happeningto the blood in my arm?    It's like it's evaporating...    It made such a fine wound!    That's right!My Stand, Justice, is made of fog.    Any wound my Stand happens to grazebecomes a gaping hole.    And then...    Justice wants to dance!    My Stand's fog has enteredyour arm like a string!    And now, you're my puppet!    You will die by your own hand, Hol Horse!    You shouldn't get so damn cocky!    Emperor!    Die, you crazy old hag!    Justice prevails!    What the hell was that noise?    It came from the room behind the lobby...    Is something wrong, Polnareff?    I thought I heard a strange noise.    I'm going to take a look downstairs.    I'll be in the lobby.Call me if you need anything.    Curse you, Polnareff!    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    I just saw him. He's in the bathroom.    Oh, the bathroom?    The bathroom is just past that door.    I thought I just heardsomeone say "toilet."    I always seem to get att*ckedin bathrooms...

To avenge my dear son,I shall rip out your insides!  -Hey, Madame!-But I can't let him find  Hol Horse's body.  She's not behind the counter, either.  It'll be even worseif the other three show up.  I have to k*ll them one by one, damn it!  Stay back! Stay away!   Oh Madame, are you here?   I thought I heard some kind of crash.   Is everything okay?   I'm coming in, Madame.   Whoa!   Ow, ow, ow, ow...   Oh no, what happened?   Oh, it's nothing.   Only a tiny fall.Just bruised my hip a bit.   You fell?   You can't be falling now.   And you b*rned your left hand, too.   You're being much, much too careless.   Oh, thank you, dear boy.I'm fine. It's nothing.   No problem, I promise.   Get out!   Who said you could come in here, damn it?   I'll spare you my wrath for now...   But when the time is right,   I'll k*ll you just like I k*lledthat bastard, Hol Horse!   All it takes is just a tiny wound...   I'll turn you intomy very own puppet of Justice!   There we go...Here's your cane.   What's wrong? You're sweating b*ll*ts.   It's nothing. Don't worry about me.   Just go to your room and get some rest.   Well, if you insist.   But are you running this hotelall by yourself?   Don't you have some family around?   Like a son?   Huh? Sorry, did you say something?   Uh, I was just sayingI've gotten used to living alone.   I see...   Sounds lonely to me.   Just think, life with a sonand daughter-in-law...   Your grandkids couldrun around and play in the lobby.   It'd be a little noisy, but...   That's what makes families great!   If you had a son, he'd probablybe older than me, right?   Hey, what's the matter?   Did he move to the big city or something?   No. He passed away.   Oh, I'm so sorry.How terribly insensitive of me...   You're the one who k*lled him,you monster!   I'll slaughter you!   Please, sit down and rest.   I'll give you a nice back rub.   I know how it feels to be alone.   I lost my mom when I was still just a kid.   Ah, those were the good old dayswith Mom...   Tonight,   just think of meas if I'm your own beloved son...   Ask me for anything, all right?   You rotten little brat!   I should just k*ll youright now, you fool!   Wow, you're really tense.   I guess living alonehas been really tough on you.   What's that guy doing here?   Hol Horse? How is he still alive?   That miscreant must havemade his Stand disappear   as soon as it sh*t the b*lletinto his mouth!   That face!   Polnareff! Behind you...   No way! You're Hol Horse!   What are you doing?   Quiet! I'm the mother of Centerfoldwhom you mercilessly m*rder*d!   Chariot!   So, you're the Stand user?   Dare play a part in murdering my boy,   and I'll make sure you pay for it!   Mr. Joestar!   It's too late.   Your trusty friends will neverhear your cries, my dear.   Because...   I've summoned my own allies.   Who the hell are you guys?   Wait, it's you...   You're that dead guy we foundwhen we got to this town...   You're the traveler from India!   We've got zombies!   Behold the terrifying powerof my Stand, Justice!   Stand users can have only one Stand,   but Justice, the fog Stand,   can transform the deadinto my personal army!   It can control hundreds of corpses,even thousands of them!   Aren't you taking this grudgea bit too far?   To think that such a twistedStand user was after us...   This whole god-forsaken town'sgot it in for you!   And if you get a wound,she'll turn you into her puppet...   I need only to give you a little scratch.    It doesn't take much, you know.    Then my Stand, Justice,will take care of the rest!    Get him!    I'm outta here!    Polnareff! Don't leave me here, please!    Oh, shut up! Did you forgetwhat you did to Avdol?    Why should I save you?    You're on your own, pal!    You can't escape, Polnareff!    I'll yank your brain out!    I'll snap your spine in half!    I'll crush your balls till they pop!    My vengeance comes now!    She's psychotic!    How can an old crone like her run so fast?    Take this!    Damn! He ran into the back room!    After him! Break down that door at once!    Just my luck...    This hallway leads down to the basement.    Mr. Joestar and the otherswill never hear me.    I'm too far away from them now!    I don't think those thingscan b*at me, but...    if I get even a single scratch,I'm in trouble.    She'll open up the wound, and control me.    Damn it... Is there no way out?    Of course the windowshave iron bars on them!    sh*t...    I'll hide in this room.    Crap, they broke down the door...    At this rate,I'm going to have to fight them.    I just have to make sureI don't get even a tiny cut.    Now they're coming down the hallway.    They must be checking every room.    Damn it,they're getting closer and closer.    Oh come on...    Did I run into another bathroom?    Why am I always gettingambushed in bathrooms?    Damn it, the toilet is so dirty...    All right, just try it.    But the second you walk in,    my Chariot will chop upfour of you in a single breath.    What?    Now it's totally quiet out there.    Damn zombies... That old hag...    What the hell are they doing?    Aren't they going to break down the door?    What's taking them so long?    Come on, do something, damn it!    They were looking through the keyhole!    What the hell?    sh*t...    The bastard stabbed me in the tongue!    Perfect! You've finally fallenunder my Justice's control!    You shitty little brat!    Now if you don't open that doorand come out,    I'll split your face openas I pull you through the keyhole,    you fool!    Laugh now!    How pitiful, Polnareff.    Very pitiful, indeed!    My son, Centerfold,    d*ed in unimaginable agonythanks to your cowardice.    This isn't even closeto the t*rture you put him through!    Now then... How aboutwe have you clean the bathroom,    Polnareff?    Lick the toiletuntil it sparkles like new.    Don't be shy!    Lick it till it's shiny...    Like this!    Anything but that...    Anything but that!    Oh, God, help me...    Oh, you startled me.    You must learn how to knock, young man...    What can I do for you?    I'm here looking for Polnareff.    And I did knock.    Maybe you didn't hear me    because you were too busydoing something else,    grandma.    JUSTICEENYABA    I'm looking for Polnareff.    Seen him, grandma?    Damn! Now what?    Unlike Polnareff, this Jotaro is clever.    He must be questioning meto see if I cr*ck.    Playing dumb will justmake him more suspicious.    Troublesome brat!    I'll just tell him the truth,    and the moment he turns his back,I'll skewer him with these!    Then he'll be easy pickingsfor my Justice.    Why, yes, I do know.    I know exactly whereMr. Polnareff is, Mr. Jotaro.    Oh?    Crap... Jotaro has no idea.    Even a tiny scratch and it's curtains!    Stay back! Tell Mr. Joestar and Kakyoin!    That hag is the enemy!    He was just here.    He's in the bathroom now, Mr. Jotaro.    Of course he is. Through this door here?    Yes, that's right.    Just go through that door,    and it's the last doorat the end of the hall.    Incompetent fool!You are a child, after all!    Murdering Polnareffwill delight my son's soul!    And spilling your blood, Jotaro,    will send Lord Dio in Egyptinto jubilation!    Oh, right.    I almost forgot...    Oh? What's the matter, grandma?    Trip on something?    That was too close...    That was close.    You shouldn't hold scissors like that...    Good thing you weren't hurt.    You're pretty damn lucky.    Sorry to ask before you even get up,but I have a few more questions.    Why did you just call me Jotaro?    I never told you my name,    and no one has called me by my name.    I find that strange.    Well, come on, tell me.    Maybe it's because I watchedColumbo as a kid,    but it's little details like thatthat keep me up at night.    You're beginning to hurtthis old lady's feelings.    It's the guestbook!    You wrote your name in the guestbook!    It's so dry.    You wrote "Jotaro Kujo."    Oh?    Then I guess you mean this guestbook here?    Yes, that's it!    "Qtaro Kujo"?    "Jotaro" isn't written anywhere.    I was onto you when you said"Joestar" the first time we met.    I told the others not to use my name.    And yet, you know it.Which could only mean...    Cut the crap!    I already knowyou're the Stand user after us, old hag.    What's the matter now?    Aren't you going to show meyour Stand and fight?    You're looking right at it!    My Stand, Justice, always prevails!    All it needs is a scratch!Just a tiny scrape!    You've fallen into my trap, Jotaro!    Polnareff!    Jotaro, it's me, Hol Horse!    Enyaba's Stand is made of fog.    It'll split your wound right openand control you,    like she did with me!    It'll even control corpses!    Can it, Hol Horse!    Can you punch the fog with your fist?    Or cut the fog with your sword?    Or sh**t it with your g*n?    Absolutely futile!    There's nothing you can do,but accept your fate!    It's the biggest, toughest Stand there is!    Our puny Stands are no match for it.    Nothing stands a chance against Justice!    Lovely, keep it coming.    Your fearful praise is music to my ears.    Now I'll control you, too, Jotaro!    Run, Jotaro!She'll put a hole in your leg!    Good grief.    I don't need to run.    Before that old hag takes another breath,    I'll defeat that Stand.    Huh? What was that?    Before I do what?You rotten little sh*t head!    Before I take another breath,is that right?    Well, I'll do that...    I'll do that right...    What...?    Jotaro's Star Platinum issucking in Justice's fog headfirst!    Please stop...    ...and he's holding it in!    He's suffocating that bitch!    Well, now...    Looks like her head is in a bit of a fog.    I'm so angry...!    "What have I been licking"?What's it matter?    What a stupid question!    Cough, cough, the toilet, cough...    Eh? You were licking what, again?    I couldn't hear you very well.    Who cares what it was?    I need to disinfect my tongue.    Just give me the medicine already.    Hm? I thoughtI just heard the word "toilet"...    Actually, I already knew about that.    But I couldn't resistteasing him about this first!    Hey! Jotaro already told you, didn't he?    You shitty old man!    You were messing with me!    Forget the medicine!    All right, all right. I'm sorry.    Come here, and I'll fix you up, Polnareff.    If you don't take care of that,it'll get infected.    Ahem! Toilet. Ahem...    You licked it real good...    Jotaro, Kakyoin! Come on,let's get the hell out of here!    Everyone, come outside.    What on earth?    We step outside the hotel,and this place is...    It's a graveyard.    She used her Stand's fog    to make this graveyard look likethe town and hotel?    So we were talking to the corpsesthat were buried in these graves...    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    You wanna take her with us?Are you serious?    Yeah.    We need to know how many moreStand users are out there,    what their powers are,where in Egypt Dio is hiding...    And what Dio's Stand can do.    Yes, what kind of Stand is it?    If we can get the hag to tell us,    we might finally have the edge we need.    I doubt she'll be willing to sharethat information...    We just need to use Hermit Purple.    I'll project everythingshe's thinking onto a TV screen.    Great idea!    This place doesn't have any TVs,so we'll do it in the next town.    Hol Horse!    You bastard!    That's our car!    Sorry boys,I'm stickin' with Dio, after all.    Catch you later!    Provided you don't diebefore then, that is.    A little advice for y'all!    You better k*ll that old witch pronto!    Or else you'll find outjust how terrifying Dio really is!    See ya!    What the hell does that mean?    Why are you here in front of me?    Lord Dio will never...    They should be able to become smaller.    When I say I'm going to do something...    He just went flying like the other guy!    Oh, God!    You don't need power to k*ll humans...
02x16 - The Lovers, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:35With Enyaba in tow,and a new carriage to boot,  Jojo and crew arrivedin the coastal town of Karachi,  Pakistan's industrialand financial center,  located in the Indus River delta.   EPISODE   : THE LOVERS, PART ONE  Hey, a doner kebab joint!  Let's stop and get something to eat.  The doner kebab: it's been calledthe hamburger of the Middle East!  A slab of meat is placed on a spit,   its outer layer roasting as it turns.   Before long, the meat is cooked,sliced, and served on bread.   Try it, your taste buds will thank you!   'Scuse me, five doner kebabs, please.   That'll be a thousand yen.   A thousand yen?   In the Middle East,   Japanese and Western business practicesare by no means universal.   Namely, prices changeand are subject to negotiation.   First-time visitors naiveof the value of goods for sale   can become easy targets for exploitation.   But here, such exploitationis not frowned upon.   The swindled are deservingof the label "fool," not "victim."   Haggling takes guts and ingenuity!   A thousand yen?   The first step is the art of the bluff.   Make it clear you see through the trick.   Don't mock me, now! That's far too much.   A hearty laugh always helps. Then...   How much would you buy them for?   ...the merchant will test the waters.   Make it     yen for five!   In return, you throw out a price so low,   you can't help but blush.   And then...   Are you serious? You've got to be kidding!   He'll act as ifyou have no sense at all...   If I sold them for that cheap,my entire family would starve!   Then he'll gesture the old throat slash.   But you can't give up the fight just yet.   I guess I'll just buy them somewhere else.   Pretend that you're leaving...   Okay, friend! I very much like foreigners.   I'll sell you five for     yen.   ...he'll try to stop you.   Then make it    .   Let the haggling begin!   Six hundred!   Three hundred and fifty!   Five hundred and fifty!   -Four hundred!-Four hundred and fifty!   Four hundred and twenty five!   I'll take them!   All right! I got them for less thanhalf his original price!   Take that! I made out like a bandit!   And just as you think you won...   I usually sell five for     yen!   Bye-bye, thank you, sir!   Hey! The old lady's awake.   Eh?   I've told them nothing!   What are you doing here?   You think I, Enyaba,   would tell them the secretof Lord Dio's Stand?   Huh?   What the hell are these tentacles?   Why...   Why have you come to k*ll me?   Lord Dio places his trust in no one.   I will make sure you never speak again.   And you four...   will be next.   Grandma!   What?   You can call me Dan...   Dan of Steel.   My Stand represents The Lovers card.   I will see to it thatyou all meet the same fate   as that pathetic Enyaba.   How could you?   That old lady was one of your own!   Grandma!   Lies...   They're all lies...   Lord Dio would neverdo such a thing to me....   Those things wrigglingout of her aren't from a Stand!   They're real! Those tentacles are real!   Lord Dio would never do me such harm...   He'd never plant a flesh bud in me...   Flesh bud?   Lord Dio is my only reason for living...   We trust each other wholeheartedly...   Grandma!   See that?   The rays of the sun disintegrated them!   The flesh buds!They're made from Dio's cells!   Precisely!   I must say,you are quite the perceptive one.   That's what a flesh bud madeof Dio's cells looks like fully grown.   I just grew it inside the old hag.    Enyaba, you may have taughtLord Dio about Stands,    but you're a fool to thinkhe would ever trust    a feeble old woman like you.    Unfortunately,it's a point you failed to realize.    Old lady!    What's the true identity of Dio's Stand!    Tell us!    You trusted and admired Dio,    and now you know he's notthe man you think he is!    We must defeat Dio! You've got to tell us!    We need to know!    Tell us what we need to knowabout Dio's Stand!    Lord... Dio...    He believes in me.    I will never tell...    Oh, God!    So sad...    Such an unfortunate old woman.    But the very depth of her trust    shows just how powerfulLord Dio's evil charm is.    Enyaba may forever be entwinedwith my sister's death,    but she didn't deserve that.    I'll see you join her!    Four against one, but we won't hold back.    Prepare yourself.    On your feet.    Hey, jackass!    Stop acting so damned cool.    This is going down,whether you want it or not.    As you wish.    But none of you    will be able to lay a single fingeron me, Dan of Steel.    What?    What happened, Mr. Joestar?    He flew back just like that guy!    You fool!    I was about to explain my abilities.    You almost k*lled your owngrandfather with that blow.    Listen up.    Do you really think I would showmy face here    just to k*ll Enyaba?    You damn bastard...    You told us that your Standis the Lovers, isn't that right?    So, what the hell does it do?    The battle has already begun, Mr. Joestar.    You're all simpletons...    Look all you want,but you won't see my Stand.    Hey, half-pint!    Want some cash?    It's yours if you hit my legwith that broom.    But why would he...    Now hit me!    The hell? Mr. Joestar?    It hurts!    I don't get it! My leg hurts so bad!    Still haven't figured it out,Joseph Joestar?    My Stand enters bodies!    The moment Enyaba d*ed,    it clambered into your ear canaland entered your brain.    What?    My Stand and I are connected!    If my Stand gets hurt, then so do I.    And the opposite holds true!    If you so much as scratch me,    deep inside your brain,    my Stand will react to my painand discomfort,    and fly into a rage.    And it will amplify that painto the same bodily location.    Now I'll say it once more...    You won't be able to lay a single fingeron me!    Plus the Lovers    has taken one of Lord Dio'sflesh bud into your body.    It's growing in your brain as we speak.    Just like it did to Enyaba,it'll eat you from the inside out!    Ow!    I don't recall asking youto strike me again.    Stupid little brat!    Well, I must confess,    my Stand, The Lovers,lacks physical strength.    It can't move evena single strand of hair,    making it the world's weakest Stand.    But...    You needn't be strong to k*ll someone.    Understand, gentlemen?    THE LOVERSDAN OF STEEL    Say something unfortunate happens,    like I get into an accident,a baseball hits me,    or I simply trip and fall, Mr. Joestar...    You will feel my pain many times over.    I can feel your knuckles crackingin my artificial prosthetic hand!    You've got ten minutes.    Then your brain will be eaten through,    and you will die like Enyaba.    Jotaro, calm down! Don't do anything rash.    No. I'm gonna k*ll this tool so quickly,    he won't have time to feel pain!    k*ll me before I feel it, huh...    Sounds interesting.    Do it, then, Jotaro.    Let's see what happens.    What were you planning to destroy?    Tell me. My face? Throat?    What? You angry? Come on and try it!    Let's just see what happens!    How about busting a hole in my chest?    Or how about you give upon using your Stand,    and cr*ck my head open with a rock?    This one looks like a prime specimen.    Sure looks big enough for the job.    You do not want to underestimate me.    When I say I'm going to do something,I do it.    Jotaro, don't do it!    You already know what he can do!    Are you trying to k*llyour own grandfather?    He just might do it...    Dumb punk.    Oh...    You...    Jotaro!    Don't toy with me, you bastard.    After the geezer kicks the bucket,you're next!    Look out!    The Lovers will enteryour brain and k*ll you!    What the hell do you think you're doing?    This is just insane.    My grandson is getting beatenso I can survive...    We're completely at this guy's mercy.    His Stand is inside my head...    I remember how that poison ringwas implanted around my aorta long ago...    Come on, think, Joseph!    There's gotta be something you can do!    Hey!    Jotaro! Keep him away from Mr. Joestar!    We're going to get as far awayfrom him as possible!    Oh, I see...    You think putting distancebetween me and the old man    might make my Stand's power disappear?    But my Stand's weaknessis made up for in other ways.    The Lovers may be physically weak,but from within its host,    its range is fartherthan any Stand in existence.    Even if it's hundreds of kilometers away.    Hey, Jotaro! I'm talking to you!    It's impolite not to look at peoplewhen they're speaking to you.    Look at me!    You sound likeyou're starting to lose your cool.    What's your plan?    Follow me arounduntil Grandpa Joseph keels over?    Dan, was it?    You know, I'm gonna make you pay for this.    Well, if you're going to follow me around,    I might as well borrow a few more things.    Nothing but chump change, huh?    Though I didn't expect a guy like you    to be sporting a TAG Heuer...    I'll be borrowing this.    There!    An electronics store!Mr. Joestar, they have TVs!    Yeah, so? Why does that matter now?    Come on, Polnareff, did you thinkwe were just running away?    I'm going to fight this blasted Standthat's inside my head.    Fight?    We have only a few minutes.    And we're gonna need your help.    Huh?    Hermit Purple!    -It's there!-Oh, no!    I can't believe I'm lookingat the inside of my brain!    I get that there's a really small Stand    inside Mr. Joestar...    But how the hellare we going to destroy it?    By having our Standstravel inside Mr. Joestar    to locate and destroy it.    What?    Stands are simplymaterializations of energy.    We should be able to shrink them.    Kakyoin!    Hey, be gentle with me!    There's no time.We're going in now, Polnareff!    All right!    Hierophant Green!    Silver Chariot!    Smaller!    Get smaller.    We're going to be entering a blood vessel.    Right...    A ditch...    I'd try to jump it,    but I could trip and twist my ankleby accident.    And walking all the wayto that bridge would be such a pain.    Hey, Jotaro.    Lie down and make yourself into a bridge.    I'll just walk on you to get across.    What? You don't want to be my bridge?    The hell do you keep yammering about?    I said, make yourself into a bridge!    You good-for-nothing arrogant prick!    -What's the matter?-Mr. Joestar!    My leg...    It's going numb...    Dammit, Jotaro,what the hell are you doing?    Aww, don't look so upset, Jotaro?    Come on, I don't have all day.    Good.    You're a rather sturdy bridge, aren't you?    Aren't you?    Aren't you?    Aren't you...    Mr. Joestar,    it seems the enemy is here,hiding around the thalamus,    the point where the nervous system begins.    Polnareff and I will enter a blood vessel    from inside your inner ear,    then swim through the blood vesselstoward the brain stem.    Polnareff, open a slit in the wallof his blood vessel.    Hey, hold on! You're using your Stands!    Can't they just go through it instead?    Not at this size.    The blood vessel's wall is too thick.    The hole will be microscopic in size,    so bleeding won't be an issue.    At our size,    severing a blood vessel or nervewould take several minutes.    Otherwise, the Lovers would'vedone it already.    Though, it may have already started...    Keeping our Stands this smallis really exhausting.    You need a lot of Stand power.    Here we go!    Oh, my God!    I don't feel so well...    My back itches...    I'm in a really good mood right now.    How about I have you lick it for me?    The one who knows himself best will win!    Everything begins when youacknowledge your own weakness!
02x17 - The Lovers, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:36EPISODE   :THE LOVERS, PART    What a nice bridgeyou make, Jotaro.  Hey, Jotaro. My back itches.  Scratch it!  Just a little lower.  Lower.  Oh yeah, that's it.  But not too hard, mind you.  -Mister Joestar?-Hey, what's the matter?   It feels likesomeone's tickling my back.   I can't concentratemuch longer like this!   Mister Joestar!   Looks like we've gotquite the c*ptive audience.   Mister Joestar, keep your voice down!   People are staring!   They'll think you're crazy!   You think I'm screamingfor the hell of it?   -Oh, no!-That poor man...   Let's give him some change.   Why are they throwing money?   Older relatives like thatcan be tough.   That is so true.   Kakyoin, go buy the TV.   Let's get out of this crowd.   Right.   Is this your store?   Uh... Yes it is...   I'd like to buy that TV.   Unbelievable...   Kakyoin's Hierophantand Polnareff's Chariot   shrunk themselvesto a microscopic level   and infiltrated Joestar's body.   They intend to fight me?   I can see them!   They're traveling throughthe bloodstream   and heading towardthe brain stem to my Lovers.   Quickly!   We don't have longbefore the flesh bud   in Mr. Joestar's braineats clean through!   Hurry, you two!   There!   All right!   Do it, Mister Joestar!   Hermit Purple!   These are...   the flesh bud's tentacles!   We finally made itto the brain stem,   but the flesh bud'salready taken over!   Damn it!   It's him!   Look!   He's using those weird clawsto knead Mr. Joestar's brain cells   into a gooey mash so he canfeed them to the flesh bud!   We have to destroy him and tear outthe flesh bud's roots quickly,   or they'll completelydevour his brain!   Okay!   I'll julienne him to ribbons!   You know on second thought.   A finer cut should do the trick!   Like grating a radish!   No you don't!   Now!   He did it!   No, not quite!   Gotta say, Kakyoin,that thing's pretty fast.   But I've already figured him out.   If that's all the little beast has,then he's no match for--   Polnareff!   Who are you talking to?   Huh?   Polnareff, that's not me.   And that's not a Stand you slashed!   It's melting away!   What?   I'm The Lovers!   Polnareff!   He disguised himself!   He was wearing Mr. Joestar's brain!   Somehow that thing usedthe kneaded brain cells   to disguise himselfas my Hierophant Green!   All you destroyed was a decoymade of those brain cells!   And you dummiescompletely fell for it!   Come on!   Pull your head out of your ass!   Better shine these shoes right,Jotaro!   I'm in a fantastic mood, you know!   So until these shoes shineas bright as I feel,   and I can see that bright sunon them, clear as day,   I'm gonna need you to polishyour little heart out.   If you'd like, you're welcometo use your uniform.   Actually, why don't youuse your tongue?   Hey! You bastard!   What are you writing?   You're looking at your tab.   And you're gonna pay in full.   I wrote it down, so I won't forget.   You're a scoundrel, Jotaro.   Well, it doesn't matter.   It'll all be meaninglessin the end.    Kakyoin, look!    Check out the decoy's headI just opened!    What the hell's going on?    He's splitting into two!    Listen up.    To win in life,one must thoroughly know oneself!    It's like Aesop's fable    when the unassuming tortoisebeats the hare.    The tortoise outruns the hare    because he knows his abilitiesbetter than anyone!    Of course,the same applies to me.    I know perfectly wellI lack the power and speed    to mortally wound either of you.    But remember this!    The spoils belong to thosewho admit their own weaknesses!    Emerald Splash!    Did it work?    More decoys are formingfrom the brain cells.    They're multiplying!    But a person can haveonly one Stand,    which means only one is real!    Where's the real one?    Right here!    Emerald Splash!    Close but no cigar!I was standing right next to--    The more decoys we hit,the more they multiply!    No, no...    It's me...    They're all me!    Polnareff, that's enough!    Withdraw your Stand now.    I can't just watch you get hurt,even if you are trying to save me.    No way in hell!    I can't standthe thought of giving up    and watching you die like this.    Withdraw your Stand!You'll be k*lled!    Do as I say.    It's over.    We fight to the end, Mister Joestar!    I can't tell...    They're all the same!    Which is the real one?    Which is the Stand?    I can't tell them apart!    The world's weakest Stand is...    The most...    the most powerful of all!    Hey now, Jotaro, look!    A beautiful gold bracelet.    Pretty impressive, eh?    It'd make any girlfall head over heels.    Jotaro,    see that space there in the glass?    Use your Standto sneak through and steal it!    Steal it.What don't you understand?    Get a move on!    I mean...    I don't mind breaking the glassand taking the bracelet myself.    Then again, if I'm caught,I could be beaten to a bloody pulp.    Old Joseph would surelydie from the pain.    Hurry it up!    While the salesman'slooking the other way!    This guy's shoplifting!    Son of a--     THE LOVERSDAN OF STEEL    Mister Salesman!    Please, sir!Don't let him get away!    Sure thing!    You bastard...    All right? Where's the thief?    Who's the culprit?    That guy, there?    That Asian kid?    Ya know, back where I come from,    when someone steals somethingwe chop off their fingers!    Hey, Jotaro.    You better not use your Standagainst civilians.    Punk!    Take this!    Despicable!    Dirty thief!    Now get the hellout of our country!    Good-for-nothing assh*le!    We'll let you off easy.You can keep your fingers for now!    That was great!Nicely done, my friend!    Thanks to the commotionyou caused,    I was able to get my handson an even better piece!    Jotaro!    What the hell are you laughing at?    What's so damn funny?    Nothing.I'm just a bit excited.    I was laughing 'causeyour punishment just doubled.    And I've been waitingfor this moment!    It's almost payback time,and it's really got me tingling.    Why, you!    It would seem we have somethingof a misunderstanding.    Sorry, but your Old Manisn't long for this world.    That's the reality you're facing.    How sad.    You don't know usvery well, do you?    I see you don't knowKakyoin at all.    Come again?    It seems to me you're obsessedwith the notion of knowing oneself.    It makes sense.    I suppose I'm inclined to agree.    To know oneselfis an important lesson.    But so is "know thy enemy."    You should have done your homework.    Can't you see?    My Hierophant...    has the powerto stretch out its feelers!    I've been inspectingevery one of you!    How could I've not noticedsomething touching me!    So you're the Stand!    Emerald Splash!    Success!    Well, well...    Looks like Kakyoingot you pretty damn good.    I'm wondering...    Will I get my paybackonce he's done?    He's realizedhe's out of his league!    He's trying to escapeinto the artery!    He's trying to escape!    He's trying to escapefrom Mr. Joestar's brain!    Huh? Did you say he's leaving?    All right!That's great news, isn't it?    -Mister Joestar, hurry! The flesh bud!-Right!    Overdrive!    The flesh bud's vanishing!    Thank God.    This whole experience sure has donea lot to bring us together.    You're incorrigible, Polnareff.    Hold on a minute.    If that thing's really tryingto leave my brain.    It'll go backto its Stand user, Dan of Steel...    The bastard is returning to its user!    This is bad!    Jotaro has no way of knowing!    What's wrong?Why are you backing away from me?    Aren't you going to tell memore about my grandfather's death?    Hey...    What's with the big hurry?    Got somewhere to go?    You're not actually tryingto run away, are you?    After all you've done...    Please, Jotaro, sir, forgive me!    I admit it, you win!    I'll change! I'll lie on the groundand lick your boots!    I know what I did was wrong!    You can pummel meas much as you'd like!    Hit me! Kick me!    But please, don't k*ll me!    Soon,    very soon,the Lovers will return to me!    And this idiot, Jotaro,doesn't have a clue!    This time it'll infiltrateyour brain!    Kakyoin is hundreds of meters away.Just you wait!    I'll make you sufferpain so horrible    you'll wish you were never born!    It's here!    Now! Enter his ear!    I figured you'd trysomething shitty like this.    Don't you know my Stand,Star Platinum,    has superior eyesight and reflexes?    Didn't you check up on us at all?    I wasn't planning anything!    Not againstyour Stand's immense power.    Did you just say "Your" Stand?    Just "your"?    No! I meant your awesomeand powerful Stand    is far superior to any other!    I knew I didn't stand a chance,so I had it come back!    Please look!    You've already shatteredmy arm and leg to pieces!    I can't possibly fight anymore!I can't even move!    Yeah...    All the crap you did to me,    I guess an arm and legshould make up for it.    Do you swear you'll never showyour face to us again?    I swear!    I'll head for some deserted island!    I'll go to the ends of the earthand never return to bother you!    You'd better not be lying.    The next time I see that face,it'll get a thousand punches.    I'm not lying!I'd never ever lie to you!    Get lost.    Let's play soccer over there!    But then I can't play!    Jotaro!    You're an utter fool!    Just take a look at that girl!    My Stand, The Lovers,just went into that girl's ear.    Now he's heading for her brain.    You'd better not move, Jotaro!    I'm going to s*ab youin the back with this Kn*fe,    and make sureyou never move again!    att*ck me with your Star Platinum,    and this girl's pathetic lifeends right here and now!    You'd never allow    such an innocent child to die,would you?    Oh, good grief.Go ahead and s*ab me, then.    Hey! Didn't you hear me?I said don't move!    Don't...    What? Huh?    What's the matter?    Didn't you say somethingabout stabbing me?    Like this, right?    My body won't move! Why?    What's this thingwrapped around me?    I see you didn't notice.    Kakyoin tied Hierophant's tentacles    around the legof your fleeing Stand.    They stretch all the way backto him like a kite string.    Guess you weretoo self-absorbed to realize it.    Please forgive me!    Ask for forgiveness from Enyaba,the woman you k*lled.    I never had the slightest intentionof forgiving you.    Dio paid me to do this.You can have it all.    Good grief.    You really are a piece of work.    What you owe me,can never be paid back with money!    Your receipt.Keep the freakin' change.     JOTARO KUJO    I have this feelinglike someone is staring at us,    so I keep looking back.    Are you sureyou're not just being paranoid?    I can't help but feelthat presence, too.    I really can't shake the feelingthat someone's staring at us.    Something's strange.
02x18 - The SunQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:37How could this have happened?  I can't believe...  I can't believewe totally fell for it.  Having managed to haltThe Lovers' invasive att*ck,  Jotaro and company avoid  the political unrestin Iran and Iraq,  and instead crossthe Arabian Sea at Karachi  to arrive atthe United Arab Emirates.   Now then, if you'd be so kindas to sign this document,   everything will besquared away, sir.   Right here, yes?   You know, if a pretty girl like youasked me to,   I might even be inclinedto buy a car.   My, aren't you sweet.   How'd you feel about the two of usgetting dinner sometime?   Polnareff, I hate to interruptwhen you're obviously so busy, but...   Mister Joestar!   Come on, it's time to leave.   Seriously!Try not to mess with the hair!   Do you know how hard it isto look this good?   As if anybody caresabout your hairdo.   You're driving.   Righto.   Bye, Mademoiselle.   But Mister Joestar,I don't get why we're riding in   such a fancy, expensive carin this sandy death trap.   Wouldn't an off-road vehiclebe better?   You'll find out soon enough.   Wow, this country's amazing!   It's like every house issome kind of crazy mansion.   Indeed.   In Tokyo, you'd needthree to four billion yen   to buy one of these.   This is the standard of livingin this country.   It wasn't but twenty years agothat this place was a barren desert.   Though, thanks toa thriving oil industry,   it's grown intoa playground for the rich.   That sun may be merciless,   but it sure is nice and coolin here with the air-conditioning.   Not too shabby.   Oh?   What's wrong, Kakyoin?   It's nothing.   I was just thinking abouthow open the landscape is here.   If anyone were after us,I'm sure we'd spot them.   But I just can't shake the feelingthat someone's watching us.   Yeah, can't say that I blame you.   Well, back to business.   I've given a bit of thoughtto the route we should take.   About a hundredkilometers northwest   is a village called Yarpline.   The desert and mountains   make taking a direct routenear impossible.   It takes two days to reach by car,   so the locals usea Cessna to get there.   We should go to the villageand buy a Cessna,   then we can crossthe vast Saudi Arabian desert.   You know,I've been apprehensive about   getting anywhere near a plane.   If a Stand user att*cked,and the plane went down,   we'd be puttinginnocent lives at risk.   With a Cessna,I could be the pilot.   We'd be able to savesome time for sure.   Flying in a Cessna with a manwho's been in three plane crashes.   Yeah, that sound's likea perfect idea to me.   That comment notwithstanding...   Our priority should becrossing the desert   and hightailing itto the village of Yarpline.   It'll take one day on camel-back.   Camel-back?   A Cessna's one thing,but on camel-back?   I've never riddena camel in my life!   Leave it to me.   I know these creatures well.I'll show you the ropes.   You boys sit backand watch the magic happen.   You want camels, you say?   Sure, but they're gonnacost you my friend.   And they need a gentle touch.   We're kind ofin a life-or-death situation here,   so we need them,whatever it takes.   As for payment,how about a trade for that car?   What?   I couldn't possibly acceptsuch an offer, sir.   Yeah, Mister Joestar!   Besides, you literallyjust bought that car!   What other reasondo you think I had   to buy such a fancy, expensive car?   It's true an off-road vehiclewould perform better here.   But we can't justwrite a check here.   And cash isn't normally accepted.   No, here,trading is far more effective.   If you try to buy safety for cheapin a time of emergency,   you'll find yourselfeven worse off in the end.   Well, it just meanswe've suffered a lot already.   -Hey, Mister.-Huh?   I take it we have a deal?   Oh, you know what?   To even things out a bit,   how bout you give me the waterin those tanks there, too.    It's the most important thingwhen you're in the desert.    But the water isn't nearlyas valuable as your car, sir.    You are very strange indeed, sir.    All right, everyone.Let's get ready.    Crossing the desertwill be no easy task.    Brace yourselves men!    That stinks!    Hey, Mister Joestar.    How the heckdo you ride these things?    It's, like, three meters tall.    So with camels...    You make them sit first,and then get on.    You make them sit first,and then get on.    You make them sit, then get on!    Give me a minute.He'll sit, just you wait.    Hey! Sit down would you!    Damn it, this one's stubborn!    You have riddenone of these before, right?    I will have you know I've watched    Lawrence of Arabia three times,start to finish!    I know all too wellhow to ride a camel!    Though, two of those times,I slept through half of it...    You learned to ride from a movie?    What?    You've never actually ridden one?    The saliva makes great sunscreen!The more you know!    Listen up.    When you're handling an animal,    it's imperative to understandexactly how it feels.    And I mean exactly!    Here, doesn't this yummy applelook scrumptious?    It's really good!    Come on, come on.    There's a good boy.    You see?I made the camel sit down!    If you take the time to get insideits head, it'll sit down for you!    I did it!    It's so high off the ground!    And did you know camels can closetheir nostrils to keep sand out?    And before I forget.    You're forbidden from makingdumb camel jokes!    All right.    Now for the finer pointsof riding a camel.    Listen up.    Camels don't walkanything like horses.    The front and back legon either side move forward together,    so these things can sway a lot.    Find a way to ridewith the camel's rhythm,    and you'll be just fine.    For example!    Hey, wait! You're going too fast!    Listen to me, dammit!    I didn't tell you to go that way!    Okay, then!    Now that everyone's gottenthe hang of mounting and riding.    We have a desert to get through!    Onward toward the northwest!    Hey!    Something's wrong.    I still have the feelingsomeone's watching us.    Kakyoin, don't you think you mightbe worrying a bit too much?    The palm leavesare erasing our tracks.    Plus we can see for kilometersin all directions.    If someone were here, we'd know.    No, I've been sensingsomeone's presence, too.    Better take a look around,then, Jotaro.    See anything suspicious out there?    No, nothing.    Nothing whatsoever. But...    Something's not right here.Something's just...    Hey, let's hurry up and go.    Yeah.    Let's get as far away as we can.    We'll traveltill the sun goes down,    then stop to pitch our tents.    It's much too dangerousfor us to travel at night.    Yeah, but it's sweltering out here!    Look, it's fifty degrees Celsius!    Yeah, it is hot out here.    Then again, right around this timeis when it's hottest.    Eight o'clock? Wha--    Jotaro! Check your watch.What time does it say?    It's ten past eight...    Hey, Old Man!    So, it is...    I know we lost track of time, but...    what the hell's going on?    It's past eight o'clock at night!    So why isn't the sun setting?    Impossible!    The thermometer's jumpingto sixty degrees Celsius!    It's not setting...    It's actually rising in the west!    Could the sun really be...    ...a Stand?     THE SUNARABIA FATS    My God!    We're in the middle of the desert!    Take cover behind those rocks!    That sun is a Stand?    We're such fools!How did we miss this?    I knew we were being watched,    but never thought this is whywe can't see our stalker!    At this rate,that sun's gonna burn all day...    no, all night long...    That Stand's gonna roast uslike a couple of rotisserie chickens!    We're screwed!    I doubt it'll take that long.    A sauna can dangerously raisethe body's temperature in minutes.    Then how do we fight it?    Damn it!It's seventy degrees Celsius now!    You can't even tellif that Stand is close or far away!    The distance is impossible to judge!    The fastest way    is to take care of the Stand user.    Indeed, the user,he has to be nearby.    We have to find him.    He must have a wayof concealing himself    to follow us this whole time.    Wait a minute!    What if he's like The Lovers?    What if he can use his Standfrom far away?    That's impossible.    A weak Stand canbe controlled from a distance,    but this sun is just too strong.    The energy it's emitting is incredible.    The Stand user has to be nearby.    This is bad.    The camels are starting to collapsefrom the heat.    This waiting isn'tgetting us anywhere!    I'll have Hierophantsurvey the area.    Kakyoin!    I'm only searching forthe Stand's location.    Once we know how far away it is,    we might be ableto locate the user.    Twenty meters. Forty meters...    Sixty meters. Eighty meters...    One hundred...    Something's not right!    Kakyoin!Have Hierophant come back!    Something's coming right for us!    Before that happens, Emerald...    Kakyoin!    The camel!    You bastard!    I'm gonna bust a holein the ground!    Everyone get in!    You okay, Kakyoin?    Yes. I was in the middleof initiating my Emerald Splash,    so that protected mefrom any major damage.    More concerningis this intense heat.    I feel like it's goingto drive me insane.    That att*ck was so accurate.    The Stand user must bewatching us from somewhere!    But from where? Where is he?    Keep your voice down.    The enemy will find us!    Just lay low. We'll sit tightfor a while and see what happens.    Oh, sh*t!    Things can't go on like this.    Come on, think!    It's time for this old-timerto grab the bull by the horns!    But this is a far-from-ideal spot.    I can't even use my best technique.    I have to get more information.    Jotaro!    Son of a bitch!    Where the hell are you?    How are you watching us?    Are you invisible or something?    Hey, Kakyoin, what's the matter?    Hey, Kakyoin!    The hell are you laughing about?    Are you all right, Kakyoin?    Control yourself, man!    Jotaro?    You too?    Polnareff!    Not you too?    Oh my God!    They've finally gone madfrom the heat!    Am I the only one who's still sane?    Hey! Jotaro,get a hold of yourself!    You have to settle down!    Sometimes things get rough,    and when they do,you have to stay cool!    What?    Don't get the wrong idea,Mister Joestar.    Have a look atthat rock over there.    It's large enough for someoneto hide behind, is it not?    I'm not following.    Now take a look at the rockon the opposite side.    Opposite side?    Still don't see it?    There's a rock that's shapedexactly the same    on the opposite side.    The shadow is also reversed.Which means...    What a stupid trick!    Move.    Stay here, Old Man.    Jotaro! If you go out there now,    you're all but askingthe enemy to att*ck you!    It's dangerous!    It made a hole in the sky?    Good grief.    You really are pathetic, Old Man.    I'll just assumethe heat was too much for you.    Or else I'd find it hard to believeyou're my grandfather.    Since we defeated the enemy Stand,night's finally fallen.    Or maybe I should say,it's back to being night.    However you wanna slice it,we're safe!    Just how long do you planon hiding in that hole?    Right.    Good grief.    It's finally gotten dark.    Well, whaddya know, it's a mirror!    Take a look.    Check out the little car he hasbehind the mirror.    It looks rather comfy.It even has air conditioning.    Man, I had no ideahe was reflecting the desert    and tailing us from behindin this nifty little thing.    I see he has a t*nk of water, too.    How bout we take it off his hands?    Oh, and here's a drink.    Huh? You mean we've alreadybeaten the Stand user?    There's nothing else to do?    We don't even knowthis guy's name,    but somehow we've alreadymade short work of his Stand?    Yes, you've hit the nailon the head.     THE SUNRETIRED    So this wasthe Sun card's Stand, huh?    At first he was pretty impressive,    but once we figured him out,he actually kinda sucked.    Well, onto our next destination.    It's pretty chilly in the desertat night, isn't it?    Hold your horses!Traveling at night is dangerous!    Why don't we camp out herefor the night!    Well that idiot's finished,so it'll be sweet dreams tonight!    Ba-dum-tss.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW
02x19 - Death 13, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:37That piercing noise...  What is this place?  An amusement park?  I've never been here before.  Why in the world am I riding ona Ferris wheel in my pajamas?  Something's wrong.  The desert...  I remember being in the desert  riding through Saudi Arabiaon camel back.   But where are the others?   Did they abandon me?   This isn't making any sense.   There's not a soul anywherein this amusement park,   so why do I hearthe cries of a baby?   Where is it?    This card is...    Death   !   The card's moving!   Kakyoin!   Hey, take it easy!   Stop screaming and shaking the bedlike that girl from The Exorcist.   You're weirding me out.   -Where are we?-Don't ask stupid questions.   Come on, get up already.   After breakfast,we're gonna take to the skies.   Looks like another scorcher.   I had a terrible nightmare.   It was horrifying.   Oh, lay on the details.   I wanna hear all about it!   Thing is, I can't remember.   -I've forgotten it all.-Huh?   Regardless, it was petrifying.   You woke me up,and pulled me out of it.   Wish we could talk more,but we gotta get a move on!   Let's go.   Hurry up and get ready!   There's a cut on my hand.   How'd it get there?    EPISODE   :DEATH   , PART      Jotaro and Mr. Joestar arealready headed to the plane.   Supposedly, we're travelingfive hundred kilometers today.   My dog!   My poor dog is...   dead!   Who would do such a thing?   A dog?   A dog...   I could've sworn I sawa dead dog not too long ago.   Whoever did this is sick,   but there's nothingwe can do about it.   Let's go.   Hey!   Hold on a dang second, Mister.   What exactly do you mean,you "can't sell us the plane now"?   You had no problemtaking my money last night!   You'll get a full refund.   But first we need to seeto a baby with a fever.   -It's    degrees Celsius.-Huh?   We have no doctor here.   We have no choice butto take the baby somewhere else.   Then how aboutthe plane over there?   That one's broken.   What's up? Some kind of argument?   Yeah.   A baby...   I remember hearing a baby's cries.   But where?   The plane will be backtomorrow night.   I can sell it to you after that.   Tomorrow night?   We've got someone's lifeon the line too!   We can't spend two dayspissing around this place!   So you'd rather let that baby die?   Well, I...   Excuse me, I have a suggestion.   We can give the babyto these gentlemen.   They can take itto the doctor on their way.   Uh, nice idea, but...   The Cessna is built to carry four.   But surely there's roomenough for a baby.   I could've swornI just saw it smile.   The baby already has teeth?   You sure about this, lady?   Do you really wannaleave it with them?   Just a minute!We can't do that either!   It's too dangerous for the babyto come with us.   I told themthis would be dangerous.   Hey, just tryand take it easy, Mister Joestar.   No Stand can catch a plane flyinghundreds of kilometers an hour.   We even made surethe plane isn't a Stand.   I'm more worried aboutthe Old Man's flying   than an att*ck from an enemy Stand.   Oh, thank goodness!   What a relief.   But I wonder whose baby was that?   You're not the motherof that child?   Oh no, I found it by the wellthis morning.   From the moment I heardthe baby's crying,    I couldn't help myself.    I felt I had to put himon that plane.    What?    I always get so tiredwhen I get on a plane.    Mister Joestar, sorry, but I thinkI need a thirty-minute cat nap.    Sure.    What is this?    Hey Kakyoin,where the hell are we?    Where's Mr. Joestar and Jotaro?    This is the same dreamI had this morning.    We're inside a dream!    -What? A dream?-Yes.    That's a relief!Just a stupid dream.    You had me worried there.    If it's only a dream,who cares about a dead dog?    Polnareff, you can't be serious!    Dreams are only as scaryas you make them.    -Oh, just try and relax.-No!    How can I when we're havingthe same dream?    I suppose you do have a point.    It is kinda weird.    But in a dreamisn't anything possible?    Oh, boy! Wouldja look at that!    Lucky me!This dreaming thing is great!    See? Think your dream is fun,and it will be!    Listen!    You saw the dog's carcassthis morning!    It must have been dreamingthe same dream as me!    It was k*lled in this dream!    I got this cut on my handwhile in the dream too.    By whom?    By the enemy's Stand, Death   !    The enemy's Stand?    Yes.    I get it, you had a dreamabout Stands!    -Come on, you've got to take it easy.-No!    It wasn't a dream about Stands!    A Stand was in my dream!    That's what I said.    You were having a dreamabout Stands.    You still don't get it, do you?    Lali-ho! Tell me, does it hurtbeing that stupid?    Oh, for the love of...    I'm saying you're slowon the uptake, Polnareff!    It's coming from the dog's wound.    Lali-ho!    This is a dream,and I'm the grim reaper,    -Polnareff!-A megaphone?    What is that thing?    Polnareff, stay on guard!    That fiend is Death   !    Wor--    Come forth, Hierophant Green!    Hierophant, att*ck!    Chario--    Why can't I summon Hierophant?    I can't get Chariotto come out either!    Is it because we're insome kind of twisted dream?    Lali-ho!    It's romantic, wouldn't you agree?Being able to die in a dream!    Lali-ho!    DEATH       Jotaro, do you sense that?    Yeah, clear as day.    Are you stupid?    Surely you know only a Standcan defeat a Stand!    It's time for you to enteryour eternal sleep, Polnareff.    Lali-ho...    Polnareff!    Die!    Polnareff.    Hey, Polnareff, wake up.    Polnareff, seems our littletraveler wet himself.    Hurry up and change his diaper.    Curses! Someone must havewoken the fool.    He's quite lucky.    Lali-ho.I suppose it's no matter.    Even if he wakes up,he won't remember a single thing.    I'll just have to finish himthe next time he falls asleep.    So, Kakyoin,it looks like you get to be first!    Lali-ho!    Hey, Polnareff, you awake yet?    The diaper!    All right, I'm up...    I feel like I had some kindof terrifying nightmare.    But I don't rememberwhat happened at all.    I've completely forgotten...    Once you change the boy's diaper,you can head back to dreamland.    I won't wake you again.    Hold on a second guys!    The kid took a dump in his diaper!    Look!Just look at the size of it!    Well, he is a baby.That's why he wears diapers.    You're kidding me!That's why?    I had no idea!What a vile, disgusting creature!    And he's gotten itall over the place!    Stop yapping and changethe diaper already!    It stinks.    How are you not embarrassed?    Grow up already, will you?    Does this look right to you?    Well, it looks good to me.    Jotaro, hold on to the edge there.    I'm going to try and pin it.    Okay. Like this?    Now hold on to the baby.    Lali-ho!    -Stop it!-Kakyoin, what's wrong?    Hey! What's going on?    Stop it!    Damn it!    I've lost control!    Hey!Don't tell me we're gonna crash?    Stop!    Kakyoin,what's the matter with you?    He was like this this morning!    I don't care, just calm him down!    Old man!Fix the control column!    We're gonna crash!    Kakyoin,pull yourself together, pronto.    We're about to crashbecause of you.    Lali-ho.    Talk about a restless sleeper!    At this rate, you're goingto k*ll yourself and my user.    Your user is that baby?    I don't believe it...    He's only about six months old.    I'm eleven months.Almost a year old!    You should also knowI'm a genius!    I may poop in my diapers,    but I know a helluva lot morethan you idiots!    Lali-ho!    And with that,you've lost your ability to scream!    A Stand within a dream...    I have to find a way to letMr. Joestar and Jotaro know.    What are you doing?    Dammit! Level us out!    Calm down!    "Panic" isn't part of my vocabulary.    Can't you see I'm working on it!    I'm not waking up...    Lali-ho.    No one's going to noticeif you're cutting your arm    with a Kn*fe that's smallerthan my wee-wee.    Besides, you can hurt yourselfall you want in a dream,    but you won't wake up.    As long as you're asleep,    I control every iotaof your precious mind.    Death    infiltrates the mindsof its slumbering victims    when they are attheir most vulnerable.    Damn it. Stop!    What's wrong, old man?    We're crashing!    I'll control it with Hermit Purple!    I did it!    I lifted the planejust in the nick of time!    What a close one...    It would seem we managedto avoid crashing.    That was too close for comfort.    Now then...    What do you say to me k*lling youby crushing that heart of yours?    Then Joestar and the otherswill think you had a heart att*ck.    Die! Kakyoin!    Did you guys see that?    How do you like them apples?    -My flying's not too shabby!-Hey.    What the hell is a palm treedoing all the way out here?    Good grief...    I knew it.    This had to happen!    CAIROABU DHABI    CRASH SITE    This good for now?    Yeah, thanks.    We survived, but...    Kakyoin, what's going on?    You got us into this whole mess,you know.    I'm not sure...    I feel like I just endureda horrible dream.    And when I awoke,I was utterly exhausted.    Something might bewrong with me.    Try and cheer up.It's probably just fatigue.    It's been about a month nowsince we left Japan,    and the enemies haven't let up.    Hey. Looks likethe baby's fever's gone down.    Thank goodnesshe's safe and sound!    If anything were to happen to him,I'd never forgive myself.    Peek-a-boo!    Such an adorable smile!    I don't get what's so funny.You're not even making any jokes.    What an idiot.    Put a sock in it!    This isn't my idea ofa perfect night either!    Hey, Old Man. The radio survived.    What should we do?Should we send out an SOS?    That'll mean Dio can find us, but...    We've got to.Let's call for rescue.    For the baby's sake.    I thought I was feelingtwinges of pain.    I'm bleeding...    Did I cut it when we crashed?    What's this? The cuts form letters.    Baby... Stand?    But how did they...?    What could this mean?It's my handwriting.    I can't remember anything.    Did I do this to myself?    The Kn*fe is free of blood,    and yet the bladeappears to be the culprit.    Could I've really forgottenviolently cutting my own arm?    Damn it!I was told he was clever.    I never thoughthe'd carve letters into his arm    while trying to wake himself.    What was that lookon the baby's face?    He deliberately looked away,the moment my gaze met his!    Baby...    Stand?    Baby... Stand.    Am I really losing my mind?    I'm starting to think...    this baby is a Stand user!    Hey, Kakyoin!    What do you think you're doing?    Come on, that is way too rough.    You could strangle the boy!What's wrong with you?    My apologies...    There, there,everything's all right.    Let's have something to eat.    A little food'llcalm you right down.    Hey, Jotaro.    It looks like Kakyoin'sreally starting to lose it.    There, there, everything's okay.    Will he make it throughthe rest of the trip?    -What do you think about Kakyoin?-Did you see that?    Kakyoin, that's enough. Stop that.    How foolish are you?    He's a Stand user!    Did you cut thatinto your arm yourself?    Am I making things even worse?    Lali-ho!

It's been about four weekssince we began our journey.  If we don't hurry,we'll be in serious trouble.  Kakyoin...  Hey, Jotaro.  What do you think is upwith Kakyoin?  First he nearly kills usin his sleep on the plane, now this.   He even went after the baby.   Something's just not right.   If you ask me,he's at his wit's end.   Do you think he'll be ableto keep going from here?   For a second there,I thought he actually figured me out.   But now Kakyoin'shalf-doubting himself.   To top things off,we're in the middle of the desert.   All I have to do is waituntil they fall asleep.   If there's no one to wake them up...   Something smells good.What kind of food is that?   Baby food.   It's a concoction of milk,egg yolks, bananas,   and bread all stewed together.   So, you wanna taste?   Wow!   This is flat-out amazing!Give me more!   Easy now!There won't be any left for the baby!   Incompetent bastard!   How dare you eat my food?   I'm wasting away over here!   Hurry up and feed me, dammit!   A...   A scorpion!   Blast it!   That was a close one.   Crap baskets!   Kakyoin was watching.   He k*lled the scorpion.   That baby really is...   sh*t!   That's it!   Mister Joestar, Polnareff,did you see that?   -Huh?-That baby's not normal!   He just k*lled a scorpion!   He stabbed it!   The boy skewered itwith his own safety pin!   Kakyoin, hold on.   The hell are you talking about?   I'm saying that baby's not a baby!   He's not even a year old,yet he knew what a scorpion is.   And he k*lled itwith those tiny hands of his!   A scorpion?   Where is it?   It's in here!   There should bean impaled scorpion in here!   It's gone?   I swear it's true!He hid it somewhere!   Check his clothes!   We got it, Kakyoin!Knock it off! That's enough!   Mister Joestar!   Like I said,you're clearly exhausted.   Get some rest,and we'll talk about it in the morning.   Okay, open wide! It's delicious!   Uh oh?What's the matter?   You were hungry a minute ago.Did you lose that big appetite?   Say "ah."   Stop it!   I can't eat right now, you idiot!   Mister Joestar!I'm not imagining things!   I don't know wherehe hid the scorpion,   but I'm sure he's the Stand user!   And there's something I havethat will prove it to you!   Look at these cuts!Read what it says!   It's a warning!   It must've happened to mewhen I was sleeping!   Oh, my God!   Kakyoin, you didn't do thatto yourself, did you?   Eh?   Kakyoin, it's finally happened...   Oh, my God!   You colossal buffoon!   Didn't you realize if you showed themthe cuts on your arm,   they'd think you were crazy?   Did I just make things worse?   It looks likeI have no other choice!   It's time for a little force!   Hierophant Green!   It's no use.   The guy has completely lost his mind.   This can't be happening.I'm certain of what I saw, Jotaro...   His Stand was the one we foughtin our dreams, Polnareff.   We can't fall asleep, Mister Joestar.   Believe me.   Everyone...If we fall asleep, we'll be k*lled.   Please, you guys.You have to believe me.   Yes! My secret is still safe!   You guys lose!   Your petty mistrustjust cost you your lives!   Victory is mine, fools!   I can't believe it...    Does this mean Kakyoin can't fightor travel with us anymore?    We'll discuss it in the morning.    Time to sleep.    Polnareff, give me a handmoving Kakyoin.    Sure thing.    -Jotaro, you bring the sleeping bags.-Right.    You say something?    No. He's just really heavy.    -I'm gonna slice every one of you up...-I see.    ...and scatter your remainsall over the desert!    Why are we sitting aroundin the middle of an amusement park,    like a bunch of idiots?    That's right!    This is...    Jotaro! Mister Joestar!Be on your guard!    My memory's coming back.    We're in a dream world.    A horrible one.    We've entered a world of nightmares!    Oh, so it's just a dream.You had me worried there.    Don't make the same mistake I did!    Listen!Kakyoin was telling us the truth!    Baby. Stand.    We're in enemy territory.    I didn't believe it either,but that baby is a Stand user!    There's no one left to wake youfrom your slumber now.    Which means,they can't escape Death   !    I'll finally finish you all!    I knocked Kakyoin out!    He should already be here!    We've gotta find him!    Where are you, Kakyoin?    I've got to make this up to you!    Polnareff, good lord!What is going on with your hair?    Did you mess up brushing it?    Eh?    Polnareff!    -What?-My...    My prosthetic hand is...    Holy sh*t!    How are we supposed to fight him?    How?    Anything can happenin this world!    There are no rules.Nothing makes sense!    He has total controlover everything!    Wait.I remember there being one rule.    If he wants to slice us to pieces,    he'll have to use his Stand,    and nothing but his Stand!    Lali-ho!     DEATH   MANISHU BOOI    Lali-ho!    -Star...-Jotaro, it's no use!    It's impossible to bringour Stands into the dream world!    ...Platinum!    That's weird...His Stand manifested.    Lali-ho! I'm a fake!    The overwhelming power!The absolute terror!    It's so much fun!    A Stand is a manifestationof the mind.    And what are dreamsif not the mind laid bare?    My Death    has trapped youin your subconscious,    which is why you can'tsummon your Stands!    But...    had you summoned your Stands    before you fell asleep,    you could havebrought them with you,    like the clothes you're wearing,    sleeping bags,and your prosthetic hand.    Death    will never be forcedto face another Stand!    And only a Standcan defeat a Stand,    so I'll always come out on top!    Now...    How about you give me a scream?    One that capturesthe joy and elation    I'm about to feelat my easy victory!    Lali... ho?    Lali-ho!    Oh, it's just oneof the fakes I made.    What?    I don't understand!    This one doesn't seem to be a fake!     This is the real Hierophant!    It's normal!    Look, it's Kakyoin!    Kakyoin's right there!    Did you forget I'd summonedmy Hierophant    by the time I wasknocked unconscious?    I had it burrow undergroundto conceal itself.    Before I fell asleep, of course.    You can't do this!    Now, it's timefor your punishment, baby.    Damn that bastard!    Let go!    Give up, Death   !    I had Hierophant place himselfin your blind spot.    If you keep upthis futile struggling...    I don't care that you're a baby.I'll snap your neck!    Kakyoin!    Kakyoin.We owe you an enormous apology.    I thought you had lost your mind!    I couldn't take you at your word.    You were fightingthis battle alone.    And for that I'm sorry.    No, Polnareff.It couldn't have been helped.    I only realized how to bringa Stand into the dream    after you struck me with your fist.    So in a way,this is all thanks to you.    Really?    Now I feel conflictedabout the whole thing!    That's embarrassing...    He's going easy on mebecause I'm a baby.    Kakyoin, that compassion of yoursis a fatal flaw!    You're all still trappedin my nightmare world!    Uh oh, what's up with these clouds?    Those clouds...    They're changing shapeand closing in!    I'm warning you,don't try anything,    Death   !    Kakyoin!    You have to get Hierophantaway from his back!    How did?    I'll chop you in half!    Impossible!    How could he do that?    He chopped himself in half.    Kakyoin!    Lali-ho!    Haven't you figured it out?    Death   's body is hollow!    It has only a head,arms, and a scythe!    You gigantic ignoramuses!    Let's see.    Kakyoin's bodyshould also be split in two    inside the sleeping bag.    Nah, just kidding!    Kakyoin!    You sure you're all right?    Please take a closer look.    He wouldn't just clingto its back forever.    Surely you know my Hierophant'snot that careless.    He's not chopped in half!    He's turning into a string.    And he's slithering into my ear!    My arm is moving on its own.    He's invading my skull.    I told you before!    My Stand was in your blind spot,and your scythe couldn't cut him.    Now then, unless you'd liketo be destroyed from the inside out,    How about you healthe cuts on my arm?    Anything is possiblein a dream, right?    Healing a cut should be easy.    Right...    All right, everyone.Rise and shine!    Polnareff, up and at 'em!    There's a nice breakfast for you!    I feel like I had a terrible dream.    You and me both.    I'm drawing a blank,but I have the feeling it was terrifying.    Kakyoin!    -Are you okay?-I'm fine.    What?    You were acting likea deranged lunatic last night!    You even carved lettersinto your arm.    Huh?    The cuts are gone?    All right, I think I'll changethe baby's diaper now.    Huh?    It's morning, sleepy head.    He seems to be getting alongwith the baby.    Maybe I just dreamedthe whole thing...    Well then,did you have a good rest?    Oh, never mind!    Everyone's forgotten.    A Stand whose very existenceis completely forgotten...    What a strange creature.    But I haven't forgotten anything.    I suppose I am the only onewho brought his Stand into the dream.    Listen.Because you're just a baby,    I won't eliminate you.I won't even injure you.    We'll take you to a nearby town.    You need to be returnedto your mother.    But don't ever comeanywhere near us again.    If you do,you'll have to be punished.    In a manner such as this...    Is that my poop?    Oh, Kakyoin.    I see you've made somebaby food for the little lad!    Yes.    Good! I'm sure he must bestarving by now.    Hey... No, you wouldn't...    Eat up!These yum-yums are delicious!    Say ah!    Again? It's as if he doesn'tlike the stuff...    At this rate,I'll have to force-feed him.    Stop!    Hey, Mister Joestar.    If you force-feed him,he'll hate it even more.    In special cases like this...    Coochie-coochie-coo...    I told you it's delicious!    Ba-dum-tss.     HIEROPHANT GREENNORIAKI KAKYOIN    Joestar and the others have nowcrossed the Arabian Peninsula,    and are currently makingtheir way across    the Red Sea as they prepareto enter Egypt.    But!    Hey, old man. Something's off.    We're going the wrong direction.    I thought we were traveling west,straight to Egypt?    Looks like we're headingfor that island.    Yeah, you're right.    I've had my reasonsfor keeping this to myself,    but before we arrive in Egypt,we need to make a slight detour.    Someone is waitingfor us on the island.    He's someone importantto our journey.    "Someone important"?    I'm the one who let Avdol die.    There's no wayI can make up for that.    To thank you for freeing mefrom the lamp...    It's an actual treasure!    ...I'll grant you three wishes!    Can you bring someone back to life?
02x21 - Judgement, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:39Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Hey, old man.Something's not right.  We're going in the wrong direction.  It looks like we're headingfor that island.  But before we arrive in Egypt,we need to make a slight detour.  Someone is waiting for us.  He is a man who is extremelyimportant to our journey.  An important man?  Hey, what's the big deal?Does someone actually live here?   This is such a tiny island,it's practically deserted.   Agreed.   Mr. Joestar,are you sure someone lives here?   He's been living onthis island by himself.   A man told me back in India.   Huh? When you say a "man to--"   What?! Mangos from India?    EPISODE   :JUDGEMENT, PART     Hey!   Somebody's watching usfrom the bushes.   What?   Hey!   From the back, he looks...   Right. I know that face!   Hold on! Just wait!   Eat up, now.   Are you hungry, Michael?How about you Prince?   I mixed in your favorite,crushed sea shells, just for you!   There's more over here.   Make sure to get nice and fat,   so you'll be a tasty chicken,Lionel.   It's not possible... That man...   It can't be...   It can't be!   I'll go and talk with him.   The rest of you,just wait here for now.   My name is Joseph Joestar.   My friends and I are travelingon expedition to Egypt--   Go away! I won't hear it!   His voice sounds like...   Don't talk to me!   It's always bad newswhen someone comes to talk to me!   It's only when something terriblehas happened!   I don't want to hear it!   I said go!   Mr. Avdol!   Avdol...   Go away!   That's...   impossible!   That wasn't Avdol.   It was his father.   His father?   He withdrew from society,and lives alone on this island.   I'm sorry I wasn't able to tell yousooner...   but if it ever came known to Diothat we stopped at this place,   Avdol's father would be putin grave danger.   I would never forgive myselfif that happened.   But...   telling him what happenedto his son...   won't be easy...   Polnareff!   Avdol's death wasn't your fault.   No, it's entirely my fault.   I'll carry that burdenfor as long as I live.   Is it safe to assumehis father is a Stand user?   Yes, but I don't knowwhat sort of Stand it is.   Judging from his father'sreaction to us,   I doubt he'll offer usmuch assistance.   You just leave the talking to me.   Hopefully my wordswill be able to reach him.   All I wanted was to avengemy sister's death.   And I end up k*lling my friend.   There's nothing I could possibly doto make it up to his father...   Talk about depressing...   This thing is pretty shiny.   I wonder if it camefrom a ship wreck?   Just look at all these barnacles.   Looks like some sort ofmetal container...   It's got some sort ofweird face carved into it.   It might be worth something.   Now, if I can scratch offthese barnacles.   What the...   It's gone!   What in the worldhappened just now?   Guess the pressurized airinside just burst out.   It's not like it's Aladdin'smagic lamp or anything...   That really startled me!   You get three!   Three I say!   Your wish is my command!   Three wishes for whateveryour heart desires.   What sort of fresh hell is this?   I am known as Cameo.   Allow me to thank you forfreeing me from the lamp.   Now name three wishesyou'd like to come true...   So another Stand user!   Silver Chariot!   This guy's not half bad.   What awesome power...    Listen buddy!    Your strength tells me,your user is close by!    Now who is it?    Would you like the answerto that question    to be consideredas your first wish?    It's a little on the boring side,if you ask me.    Don't pull that"Genie in the bottle" crap with me!    Are you saying you couldmake me rich right now?    Huh?    Is that your first wish?    Let's see you do it!    Stop jerking me around, damn it!    Very well.Your wish shall be granted.    Wha...    What was all that about?    Was that thing a Standor wasn't it?    He's a strange one.    He didn't att*ck me,but told me to make three wishes.    I don't know what's going on,but I don't trust this guy.    Someone shady is on this island.    I should tell Mr. Joestarabout what just happened.    It could have something to dowith Avdol's father...    That's weird...    What's up with all thatloud clanging back there...    Is this for real?But it can't be!    This is gold fromthe Napoleonic era.    This isn't a dream or an illusion.    It's the real thing.A treasure trove of gold!    Are you mocking me or something?    No... Can't be.    When could he have buriedthis gold here?    No way he had time to bury itafter I made my wish.    How the hell didthat freak do all this?    Now, what is your second wish?    Your wish is my command.    Bastard!    Why are you doing this?What are you scheming?    I'm not falling foryour stupid tricks!    If you're my enemy,then fight me like one!    If not, I'll take this treasurefor myself.    I take it knowing the answer tothat question is your second wish?    Though, it's a little on the boring side,if you ask me.    But I owe you forletting me out of that lamp,    so I shall grant your wish.    You smug bastard!    All right then... I do have a wish...    I want to be a comic artist!    That was always my dreamwhen I was a kid!    I wanna be bigger than Disney!    Not some starving artist!    I'm gonna buildmy own Polnareff-land!    Wait, scratch that.    Just give me a second.    Any minute now... It'll come to me...    I want a girlfriend!    More than money or fame...    I want true love!    Not only someone who's really cute,    but a relationship connected bythe red string of love...    I want to meet a girl    who feels the same way about meas I do about her!    So grant that if you can, damn it!    You want a girl, do you?Very well.    Wait, no, never mind!I need more time.    The deceased...    Can you bring them back?    From the dead?    Am I to assume your wanting to know    the answer to that questionis your second wi--    Enough already!    I'm asking you to bringmy dead sister back to life!    And you can do the samefor my friend Avdol!    But that's just too muchfor you, right?    Very well.    I shall grant your wish.    What?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    So you can really... do it?    Indeed.But since you made two wishes,    I'll grant themin the order you asked.    First, I will grantyour second wish    to bring back your sister.    Hail to you!    Hold it! Who the hell are you?    Why are you--    What was that sound?    I'm sure I heardsomething rustling...    It sounded like someonewas digging up the ground...    There's that weird digging again!    Where's the sound coming from?    No... it can't be!    Is that a woman crying?    All right, who's there?    These are...    These are strands of hair...    A woman's hair.    A woman's footsteps...    Impossible!    There's no way...This can't be happening...    My little sister is still inher coffin back in France...    Just who the hell are you?    Answer me, now!    Please... stay away...    I'm in so much pain...    My body hasn't fully formed...    I know that voice...    Sherry!    Hey, where'd Polnareff get off to?    I couldn't find him up top.    It's already nightfall,and he's nowhere to be seen.    You don't think he ran into the enemy,do you?    Sherry...    Is it you?    It is you, isn't it?    Where are you going?    Where are you going, Sherry?    Wait Sherry! It's only me!    Sherry, why are you running away?    Come on, Sherry, please,show yourself!    Please, Sherry, wait!    Let me see your face...Let me see it one more time...    Brother!    Higher, brother!Raise me as high as you can!    Yay! Now spin me around!    Oh, it's simply wonderful!    I've been wanting a new umbrella.    Thank you for buying it for me.    I'm off, now.    Sherry!    What... the hell happened here?    They've been half eaten!    Sherry!    Can you hear me?Why are you running away?    It's me, your big brother!    Because... my body is covered in dirt...    And my hair... It's so unkempt...    It's okay, Sherry!Don't worry about that!    You're perfect just as you are.    Why are you crying?    Why are you sad, Sherry?    Sherry...    No.    Just stay back.    Don't come any closer!    What are you saying?You're not making any sense!    It's simple...    I'm saying you'll hate me.    Hate you?    Have I ever told youthat I hate you?    Yes.    When we were kids...    When I gave your favoritetropical fish to the cat...    You got really mad,and said you hated me.    I admit I was angry that day,    but I've always loved youmore than anything!    I still do!    Really?    You've always loved me?    Yes, of course I have!    You'll love me, no matter what?    I love you, no matter what.    And I can clearly see nowyou're the real Sherry.    You have no idea how muchI've missed you!    I see...    I feel the same, big brother.    Sherry, please look this way.    Show methat beautiful face of yours.    Why are you crying?Are you still sad?    Sad?    No, Brother.    These aren't tears of sadness.    What is it then...    I'm...    I'm happy, brother...    cause I can finally eat you!    Chariot!    Sher... ry...    I'm sorry that I bit you, brother.    I'm afraid my body'sstill underdeveloped.    But if I eat your flesh,I'll return to normal.    It's OK if I eat you, right?    You always did what I asked you to.    Cameo!    You rang?    You bastard!    What? Do you have a complaint?    I granted your wish, didn't I?    Granting wishes is my power,after all.    The rest is up to you.    Then I'll tell youmy third wish!    Make my sister...    Make my sister...    Let my sister rest in peace!Return her to her grave!    I don't think so!    What?    You still don't get it,do you Polnareff?    I'm a Stand!    I'm the Stand represented bythe Judgement card!     I extract wishes from the deepestcorners of the human mind,    and manifest themfrom the soil below.    You created your sisterfrom your own yearning!    How dare you...    And since you created her,I cannot undo it.    This match goes to me!    By the way...    I recall you saying somethingabout a third wish,    but you've already made    your third wish.    You...    You don't mean him...    When a man wishes from the heart,    all of his greatest weaknessescome to light.    -Because of you, I...-Avdol, I...    I never thought you'd be this hurt.    I'll get better if I eat, right?    Anything but the third wish...
02x22 - Judgement, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:39Quite the traumatic experience,isn't it?  Being eaten aliveby your very own sister.  When a man uncovershis deepest desires,  all of his weaknessesare laid bare.  You gave nary a thoughtto the depraved nature  of bringing someone back to life.  Everyone wants to believethat their loved ones  are still alive somewhere.  You hope that they'llsuddenly pop in tomorrow   and say, "Good morning."   By the way...   You said somethingabout a third wish,   but, if I'm not mistaken,you've already made said wish.   You mean...   You wished for Avdolto come back to life!   Hail to you!   No... He's…   Avdol!    Av... dol...    My fingers...   They've crumbled to pieces.   Polnareff!   I blame you for this!   Because of your bumbling, I...   I ended up like this!   Avdol... I...   I made you...   I...   You'll pay for this, Polnareff.   And you'll do it with...   your flesh!   I'll get better if I eat, right?   Right?   Big brother!   What's the matter, brother?   Stay away from me!   Both of you...Please go back to your graves!   Why? You're the onewho brought us back.   The time has come for youto enter your grave!   I was so panickedI forgot to summon Chariot.   How could I've beenso caught up in my wish   that I neglected to use my Stand?   Leave me alone!   Get away from me!   What?   "Please"? Oh no!   You don't have any wishes left!   I've already grantedyour three wishes.   You don't get any more!   Stop it!   Hail to you!   Go ahead. Writhe and screamto your heart's content!   You're in the middle of nowhere.   Your friends by the shorewon't hear you.   No one can save you now!   It's no use. This is the end...   I'm going to die. I'm finished.   Sherry...   Avdol...   I suppose it's what I deserve.   It's only fitting.   Avdol, it's like you said,you d*ed because of my actions.   And so... I've accepted my fate.   What...   My vision must be going.I'm seeing double.   It looks like there are two Avdols.   Of course there's not another one.   If I'm seeing things,guess it means the end is near.   The blood loss is taking its toll...   I'm hallucinating.   All right... This is it.   I'll have to tap out early.   Goodbye, Mr. Joestar,Kakyoin, Jotaro...   I pray for your victory.   As for you, Avdol...   I'll atone in the next world...   What? Impossible!   I was right!I knew I saw another Avdol!   My eyes weren't playing tricks!   Besides the dust and dirt version...   There's another Avdol!   Magician's Red!   But how? He's supposed to be dead!   He was stabbed bythe Hanged Man, Centerfold!   How the hell is he alive?   Tsk.   Mohammed Avdol!   Yes, I am!   Is it really you?   Tsk.   Tsk.   Is it the real you?   Polnareff,you haven't changed in the slightest.   You still lose all common sensewhen it comes to your sister.   No!   You're supposed to be dead!   Hanged Man sunkhis blade into your back,   and Hol Horse put a b*lletbetween your eyes,   k*lling you on the spot!    You're correct about my being sh*t.Right in the forehead...    But because I was stabbedin the back, for a moment,    my face was looking up,and the b*llet only grazed me.    I suppose this is what onewould call a blessing in disguise.    Hol Horse's b*llet broke my skin,scraping my skull.    It didn't reach my brain.It only grazed me.    But I did completelylose consciousness.    So you call yourself Cameoof the Judgement card?    Hell is near, so prepare!    Hell to you!    I know it was only the third wish,but still...    It's really him.    It came true!    JUDGEMENTCAMEO    Mohammed Avdol is indeedalive and well.    I would call this bad news.    Shouldn't you scurry awayto inform Dio    and your fellow Stand usercompatriots about my return?    Well, shouldn't you, Cameo?    That's right! I have to tell them!I have to let them know!    Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, and Jotaro!    This is very surprising news,to be sure.    But I can spin it this way:    Not only did Judgement's Cameoslay the idiot Polnareff.    He also succeededin eliminating Avdol,    who was actually alive!    I can't wait to tell themthe splendid news!    Magician's Red!    Whoa, there.    Avdol!    The Stand... It's far more powerfulthan I expected.    Careful!    It's not just his power.He's got incredible speed, too!    Come now, Avdol,is that the extent of your abilities?    It appears sharing my newswill be even easier than expected.    May fortune...    be with you both!    What?    Hail to you!    Big brother...    No. My Sherry...    Sherry... d*ed.    You're...    nothing but...    a hunk of dirt!    But brother...    Polnareff.    Apologies.    I take back what I saidabout you not changing.    No, you were right.    I'm the one who should apologize.    This battle hasalready been decided.    Avdol!I'd like to hear your three wishes!    Your wish is my command!    Until I put you to restfor good, that is!    Go ahead!You may as well give it a sh*t.    As I said, you get three wishes.    Bastard! He's making fools of us!    Just ignore him, Avdol!    You don't have to make any wishes!    Avdol, are you listening to me?    No good...    I want four wishes!    Wha...    What?    My wishes. Can't you hear?    I wish that I had four wishes.    Tsk.    You can't be serious...    Are you denying my wish?    Cameo, you're the onewho offered them!    I'm going to make sureyou keep your promise!    You still insist uponthis futile contest of power?    Your kicks are nothing!    What?    That's the way! Super!    Tsk.    My first wish was to make youcry out in agony.    And it came true.    This is madness! Your strength!    You're so much stronger!    The laceration the Hanged Manleft on my back...    hasn't completely healed yet.    I was guardingmy wound from as*ault,    and had to hold myself back some.    Wha...    I was finally able to stand againonly three days ago in India.    But since I took a plane here,the trip was rather easy.    That's, Avdol! Still the best!    Now, for my second wish...    I wish for you tocry out in utter terror!    Now for my third wish...    Cry in regret!    That bastard! He's running away!    Wait, damn it! Get back here!    Shh. Polnareff, quiet...    With that kind of power and speed...    given the rule of Stands...    the user must be hidingsomewhere nearby.    Is he here?    He should be hiding outvery close to us.    -Hey, could that be...-Shh!    The Stand useris hiding underground?    Why you!    You're gonna pay...    How dare you use my sister?Time to show you hell!    Hell to you!    Bastard!    I can think ofa few things to drop in...    Like dirt and sand...    A spider...    Ants too...    And a match.    Bastard! I hope you're ready.Your suffering has barely begun!    Hey, Polnareff.    I think I need togo to the bathroom.    Come on! How 'bout it, my friend?    Shall we engage in the timelessritual of male bonding?    Tsk.    Huh?    Somehow I made itout of that mess alive.    Come on, Polnareff!Let me hear you laugh!    Laugh, my friend!    Avdol... It seems likeyou're the one who's changed.    You would've never thoughtof doing something so perverse.    This isn't a result of youbeing sh*t in the head, is it?    That's it! Aim that thing!    Right!    Please forgive me!    Finally, my fourth wish. It's...    to not grant you a single oneof your pitiful wishes.    My magician's Red forgives no one.    Especially you.    Ba-dum-tss!     MAGICIAN'S REDMOHAMMED AVDOL    Hey! You guys'll never believe it!    Guess who I just ran into?    Polnareff!We've been worried about you!    How did you get those injuries?    Was it an enemy?    Who cares about my wounds?    Ready?Now don't be too shocked, Jotaro!    Promise you won't throwyour back out in surprise, Kakyoin!    Who do you think I met out there,Mr. Joestar?    Prepare to be blown away!    Tum-ta-da-da!    Here he is!    That sly bastard Avdolwas still alive!    Doo-do-doo!    Well, we should probably get going.    Here, allow me to help youcarry your luggage.    Hey, Avdol.    How ya been doing?    Avdol, is that wound on your backhealing up all right?    It's fine.I'm still a bit stiff, but...    Hey...    Has it really been two weeks?    -We're lucky to-Hey...    all be alive.    Jotaro, you're stillwearing your uniform?    Don't you ever get hot?    Hey, just hold up a second, guys!    I told you to hold on a second,you assholes!    What's with thoselaissez-faire attitudes?    A man we thought was dead is alive!    How can you just brush it offlike nothing ever happened?    Oh, sorry about that, Polnareff.    When I told youI buried Avdol in India...    I may have lied.    What?    Mr. Joestar and Jotarowere the ones    who tended to the wounds onmy head and back in India.    You assholes have known Avdolwas alive this whole time,    and you didn't tell me?    Kakyoin, you, too?    I only found outthe day after it all happened.    It was imperative to not letthe enemy know.    You have a big mouth,so I suggested...    Sorry, since you cannever tell a lie,    I suggested we keep ita secret from you.    If you'd let the secret slip,    Avdol wouldn't have beenable to recuperate in peace.    We were planning to tell youas soon as we knew he was safe,    but we didn't thinkyou'd run into him first.    Oh, yeah, Avdol!    Your dad's on this island!    Let's tell him you're here!    Oh, that was just me in disguise.    Say what?    Then all that was for show?    Go away!    It's always bad news whensomeone comes to talk to me!    I don't want to hear it!    Avdol's death wasn't your fault.    You didn't have to go that far!    How dare you leave meout of the loop?    Now, now.There's no reason to cry.    I'm sorry.I didn't think you'd be this hurt.    I apologize as well.    But I had a very good reason forcoming to this island in disguise.    Yeah, what?    It was partially so the enemywouldn't find out,    but I also had Avdoldo some shopping for me.    What kind of shopping?    It was a veryconspicuous acquisition.    So I disguised myselfas a wealthy Arab gentleman.    All right, everyone!Let's climb aboard and head out!    Polnareff, cheer up already.Come on.    It's almost here!    What's almost here?    I don't see anything...    What?    A submarine?    That's right! From here on out,we're riding to Egypt in this!    You've gotta be kidding!How'd you afford this?    How about this glistening design?    A submarine, huh...    Perhaps a refreshing whitewould be best.    Hurry up and make some coffee.    I just don't knowwhich one to pick.    Kakyoin, why are youtaking that cup?    Hello? Oh, is that you, Joseph?
02x23 - High Priestess, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:40Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Tum-ta-da-da!  Here he is!  That sly bastard Avdolwas still alive!  Doo-do-doo!  Mr. Joestar and Jotarowere the ones  who tended to the woundson my head back in India.  I also had Avdoldo some shopping for me.  From here on out,we're riding to Egypt in this!   You've got to be kidding!How'd you afford this?    EPISODE   :THE HIGH PRIESTESS, PART     The Red Sea.   It's what diversacross the globe have called   the most beautiful seain the world.   Flanked on the east and westby desert,   it was once believed to besurrounded by crimson sands.   Today, it's generallack of pollution   and inflowing river watermake its waters pristine.   Avdol, do you knowhow to steer this thing?   Tsk.It's no problem whatsoever.   And Avdol's not the only one!   Don't even think about it.   You're not putting usthrough another crash.   You sure seem to bein a foul mood!   So this is a submarine...   I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.   It's a lot more spaciousthan I expected.   Isn't it? Rich folks use them whenthey want to get away for a while   and explore the sea floorfor pleasure.   As you see, it even has windows.   -Oh! Nice!-Whoa there!   You know, I've always sort ofliked this kind of thing.   Though, I wish I could'veridden in one with a cute girl...   Once again,you haven't changed, Polnareff.   Can you try just this onceto take things seriously?   What's that?   This is sonar.   It uses reflected sound waves   to detect underwater objects,like radar.   Wow...   All clear.   I'm not picking up anythingin our vicinity.   With this machine, we can detectanyone trying to att*ck us,   from any direction.   But if someone didatt*ck us in here,   we'd have nowhere to run.   Don't forget, we are    metersbelow sea level.    It is amazing...   But I guess it isa cruiser for the wealthy.   It has a refrigerator,coffee maker...   It's even equipped withthe latest in satellite phones.   Hey, Kakyoin, get me a drinkwhile you're up, will ya?   I'm dying of thirst here.   -I'll take one, too.-All right.   Is cola okay?   Old man.   Why are you just standing there?   Men, I need you to give mea moment of quiet.   I just remembered I need tomake a phone call.   A phone call? To where?   Who would you need to callfrom all the way down here?   Someone important, I assure you.   You might even call ita delicate matter.   Again, I need you all to be quiet.   Oh, heaven's me...Which one should I pick?   The sparkly designis much more to my liking,    but is it appropriate forthe charity event tomorrow?   Perhaps a refreshing whitewould be better...   Oh, what do you think, Rosas?   Both of the gownslook lovely on you, Madam.   Coming!   Hello?   Oh, Joseph, darling, it's you!   Where have you been?And where are you calling from?   It's a bit...   hard to hear you.   Right, sorry... I'm at a hotel.   I hate to say it, but...   I have to attend someunexpected business that's come up.   Oh, goodness. It must be difficult   traveling to another countryright after going to Japan...   It's been nearly a month,hasn't it?   Yes. I'm sorry.   By the way, Suzie...   Have you spoken to Holly?   Yes, I just spoke to heron the phone yesterday.   She mentioned catching a cold   that's developed intoa bout of pneumonia.   She tried convincing meit's not serious,   but I think I might visit her.   No, don't. There's no need for that.   I'm positive she'llrecover quickly.   -You're such a worrywart...-This is what he meant by "delicate"?   Indeed. Madam Joestar   is still as effervescent as ever.   So he checks in now and again   to ensure she doesn't visitMiss Holly in Japan.   That way she's protected from the truth.   Are you saying that she...?    I am.    She hasn't been told anything.    We needn't worry her unnecessarily.    There's nothing to worry about.    Well, if you say so....    All right, I understand!    I'll hold off on going to Japan!    By the way, Joseph,I have something I need to ask you.    I'm having difficultydeciding between    the white dress and the purple one...    Is that so?Suzie, I need to speak to Rosas.    -What?-Madam.    Have you considered wearingyour blue dress?    I think it's inthe back of the closet.    That's right.I'll go and have a look.    Hello, Master Joseph. It's me.    Where's Suzie?    She's left the room, sir.    She won't overhearour conversation now.    I see...    Actually, I'm callingfrom the submarine    we spoke of a while back.    Then I take it you were successfulin reuniting with Master Avdol?    Yes.    Now then, tell me abouthow Holly's doing.    Have you gotten hold of the doctorsfrom the Speedwagon Foundation?    Well, actually...    On the phone, Miss Holly saysshe has nothing more than a cold.    She is quite insistent...    But her condition worsensby the day.    Master Joseph!    Don't you think the time has cometo tell Madam Joestar the truth?    No.    There's no needto get her riled up.    We are going to putan end to all this very soon.    I want Holly to go back    to her normal life.    Don't inform my wife of what'sgoing on under any circumstances.    I'll call again soon.    If that is what you wish.    I pray for your safe return.    Oh, Rosas, did you hang up already?I wasn't finished talking to him!    Oh, Madam...    It's no matter.Why don't we have some tea?    You will join me for a cup,won't you, Rosas?    -Oh?-Madam!    Don't trouble yourself.Allow me to serve the tea to you.    Really?    I'm sorry you have to do that,Mr. Joestar.    But you can rest easy,'cause we're right here behind you.    We'll be in Egyptbefore you know it!    We must defeat Dioas soon as we can,    and save Miss Holly from his curse.    I have returned from the brink,for this very reason!    Thanks, you guys, really.    Driving this isactually pretty easy!    Guess that's how you weremaking it look so simple, Avdol.    For Pete's sake!    Hey, don't get so carried away!    The sea is riddledwith potential hazards!    Yeah, yeah.    All right!Let's speed this tub up a b--    Polnareff!    I had nothing to do with that!    I'm so tired.Tell me we're almost there...    One, two, three, four, five...    Oh, exactly five cups in here.    Hey!    Hurry up and make the coffee, man!I want some now!    Make it yourself!    Good news! I've just spottedthe coast of Africa!    We'll be there soon!    Near this coral reef,    lies a natural undersea channel.    The exit istwo hundred meters inland.    We can surface there.    We've finally made it to Egypt.    It took long enough.    So this is Egypt...    Yes, we have arrived.    -What's so funny?-Nothing.    I'm just feeling sort of happy,that's all.    It's been a whilesince the five of us    were all gatheredtogether like this.    Hey, Kakyoin.    Why'd you grab six cupsfor five people?    That's peculiar.I guess I didn't notice.    I could have sworn it was five...    -Wh---What?    -Old man!-Mr. Joestar!    Impossible!    It's a Stand!    I don't know how,but it managed to sneak on board!    -Now it's gone!-No, it didn't!    It transformed!    It disguised itselfas one of the gauges!    Just like with the coffee cup!    Come again?    The coral reef!    And we were a few     metersfrom reaching Egypt!    Luckily, it looks like Mr. Joestarwas only knocked unconscious.    The problem is his hand.    The phone?    Who'd be calling us now?    Ignore it, Polnareff!    We have to stay focused!    It's the High Priestess.    Our enemy is using a deadly Standcalled The High Priestess.    So you know it well?    Somewhat.    The name of this particularStand user is Rose.    She has the ability to controlher Stand from far away,    so she's most likely on land.    What's its power?    It can turn into almostany inanimate object,    as long as it comes from a mineral.    Plastics, metal, glass, or vinyl.    There's no way to recognize it,until it decides to att*ck.    But how'd it sneak aboardin the first place?    I get it now,so that's how it did it.    How simple...It cut a hole and moseyed on in?    The ballast tanks are damaged!    We're sinking even faster!    Not to mention we're losing oxygen!    We can't go on like this!    Shut up! Whoever's callinghas horrible timing!    Jotaro?    Hey! Anything we touchcould be the--    Hi again, Joseph, it's me!    We weren't finished withour conversation,    so I made Rosas give me the number.    Why aren't you speaking?    Come to think of it, what's withall the ruckus over there?    Is that a... siren I'm hearing?    And that running water...Is your bathtub overflowing?    Sorry, but the old mancan't come to the phone.    I know that voice... Is that you...    Jotaro? Where's Joseph?    You should be in Japan.    Why are you with your grandfather?    Jotaro, answer me!    There's nothin' to worry about,Grandma Suzie.    He'll be fine.I'm right here with him.    Later.    We'll call backonce things calm down.    Jotaro!    Brace yourselves!We're about to hit the bottom!    Oh my God!    I knew this would happen!    Every vehicle we usegets destroyed!    I'm never riding ina submarine again.    HIGH PRIESTESSROSE    How strange...    I was getting through a moment ago.    It's as thoughthe line's suddenly gone dead.    But...    And why was Jotaro...    Hey, the oxygen'sgetting thin in here.    Kakyoin.    Did you catchwhich one of the gauges    the Stand merged with?    It looked likeit turned into this one.    That's not it! Jotaro!    It's already moved!    It's right behind Kakyoin!    Hierophant Green!    Kakyoin!    Everyone, head for the door!    It's traveling acrossthe machines' surface!    You say that, but...    If we stay in this room,    there's a very good chancewe won't survive!    Kakyoin, are you all right?    Yes...    Everyone, get to the next room!    We'll seal the room off,and trap it inside!    There's no way!    It already moved to the doorand transformed into the wheel...    I have to let gobefore it's too late!    Its claws wereable to slice through    Mr. Joestar's prosthetic hand...    What?    Yes! We got it!    That was close...    Apparently, our little friend hereisn't as fast as Star Platinum.    So, what should we do with it?    Jotaro, what are you waiting for!    Show no mercy!    Hurry up andrip its little head off!    Aye-aye, sir.    That bastard...    It turned into a freakin' razor!    Damn...    It's strong!    I can't believeit outsmarted Jotaro!    What an enemy...    What the hell is going on?    Whatever's happening here,I'm pretty sure we're in a pinch.    Shut up, old man!    The beast will att*ck usif we touch it.    Meaning we must useour Stands instead!    Magician's Red!    Silver Chariot!    It's a tough one!    Chariot's rapiercan't pierce its armor!    Pick up the pace!    We have to att*ckbefore it gets away!    Everyone, stand back!    There's still someoxygen over here.    It's going to run out soon!    -Are you all right?-Yeah.    Forget it, Jotaro!It'll only transform again.    We're taking on water fast,so we need to trap that thing!    We'll figure outhow to fight it then!    Know that it'll be Jotaro Kujo    who'll hammer youinto a bloody pulp.    What did you say?    Jotaro, why in the hell would youanswer a call from Suzie?    Damn it... You reallyshouldn't have done that!    Whatever....    We'll talk about itwhen we get out of this mess.    Leave everything to me!    Do you have a plan?    You bet... And it's a brilliant one.    Joseph Joestar has gotten throughsituations like this    more than once in his life!    I can't begin to understand whyJotaro is with Joseph?    Has Joseph said anything?    No, Ma'am...    Though... My heart jumped with joyto hear that boy's voice.    I heard he's beenquite the handful,    but deep down he's a sweet childwho cares very much for his family.    I'm sure he's helping Josephas much as he can.    Yes, Madam.    Master Jotaro and Master Josephare most likely    in the midst of battlinga common enemy as we speak.    They're fightingto save Miss Holly,    someone very dear to them,    from a curse of unbridled evil.    What do we do now?    I have a feelingthat devil of a Stand    isn't really the one trapped here.    Sooner or later, that monster'llcut its way out of that room    and catch up to us!    Being sealed off withall this machinery    makes us sitting ducks in here!    The submarine is done for!    We need to abandon ship and escape!    We'll have to findsome other way to Egypt!    We're    meters below sea level!    It doesn't sound that bad,    but how are we supposed toget out of here?    We're really gonna scuba dive?    I've never done anything like this...    Hurry everyone!Suit up on the double!    Good grief.    I just realized I won't be able tosuit up in time    with this busted hand.    Help me out, Jotaro.    Do it yourself.    First of all,make sure not to panic.    The ocean floor is so beautiful...    If it's OK, you'll do this...    If we're in trouble, do this.    I think I'd like to seeyour face sometime.
02x24 - High Priestess, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:41Anyone else getting nervous?  Try to stay calm.  Times like these require usto keep our heads on straight  and be prepared.  Putting this stuff on with one handis a lot harder than it looks.  So has anyone everscuba dived before?  Not me.  -No.-I haven't.  The High Priestess willbreak through any moment!   You have to teach ushow to dive now!   Try and calm yourself, Avdol.   You must never panic,no matter what.   This is the most important rulewhen scuba diving.   When you're underwater,   for every ten metersyou go below the surface,   the corresponding pressureincreases along with you.   The surface pressurestarts at one atmosphere.   We're    meters belowthe surface right now,   so we'll endurefive atmospheres of pressure.   If we surface too quickly,   the pressure'll cause our lungsand blood vessels to burst.   We have to rise slowlyso our bodies can adjust.   We're nearing the Egyptian coast.   It's best to ascendalong the sea floor.   OK...   I'm letting the water in.   You're looking at a regulator.   The valve inside allows air in fromthe t*nk only when you inhale.   The air you breathe out existsthrough the piece on the left.   What about spit?   What happens if I need to droolor hock a loogie or something?   That stuff comes outthe opening here.   And, this should go without saying,but we can't talk underwater.   Instead, we'll use hand signals.   Let's keep things simpleand use two.   When things are going smoothly,we'll use this to say "OK."   When they aren't, use this.   Mr. Joestar, couldn't we justuse our Stands to communicate?   Oh yeah, I didn't think about that.   Aww, man! And I was about to sayI know a really good hand signal.   He says,"Your underwear is showing."   Yeah!   We could be att*ckedand k*lled at any moment!   Stop fooling around and let's go!   This room is about to befilled to the brim with water.   Put your masks and regulators on.   Polnareff!    EPISODE   :THE HIGH PRIESTESS, PART      When did...   The Stand had already integratedwith the regulator!   That bastard...   It's gonna rip him apartfrom the inside!   sh*t!   Drain the room!   It's too late!   It must have been lying in waitfor just this moment!   Crap!   It managed to burrowinside Polnareff!   It'll tear out his guts!   What should we do?   Hierophant Green!   Hermit Purple!   Hey...   I grabbed it before it wenttoo far down his throat!   Me, too!   Let's pull it outbefore it transforms!   Success!   All right, keep it just like that!   Look!   It's transforminginto something else!   You've got to be kidding me!It turned into a spear g*n!   Emerald Splash!   Silver Chariot!   Let's get moving!   It's already reloading!   It doesn't quit!   Hurry!   Move it, old man!   Yeah, I'm coming!   That was too close...   It's too soon for us to relax.   The bastard knows exactlyhow to hit us where it hurts most.   Polnareff, you all right?   Yeah, I'll be fine...   You guys saved me back there.   Merci beaucoup.   Just look at how beautifulit is down here.   This would've made a spectacularplace to visit on vacation.   Plan your next getawayanother time!   We have to surface beforewe run out of oxygen.   Think we're safe?   I believe so.   The High Priestess can transforminto metals and glass,   but it can't take the formof bubbles or fish.   Just keep your eyes peeled.   If it pursues us,   it'll probably transform intoa screw on our gear.   Be careful of moving pebblesand stones, too.   Look! I think it's the sea tunnel!    We're at seven meters.    We've finally reachedthe Egyptian shore!    We can swim along these rocksto the surface!    What?    Is that the...    It's the Stand!It merged with the sea floor!    And it's gargantuan...    It's pulling us into its mouth!    This is impossible!    How is it so gigantic?    The hell?    It's colossal! This power!    It was so small before!    You boys are so slow on the uptake!    Didn't it cross your mindsthat if the rocks are mineral,    it would mean the sea bedis mostly mineral, too?    If the Stand is this powerful,the Stand user must be close!    And I'd wager,she's closer than we think!    You guessed it!    I'm seven meters above you,on the shore!    But since you're about to be groundto bits by my High Priestess,    you'll never have a chanceto see my face!    I can't tell what partof the Stand we're in.    Seems like we'restill inside its mouth.    Luckily, we weren'tsucked down its gullet.    Hey, Jotaro!    You're just my type,    so this is going to be as painfulfor me as for you.    It's too bad I have to makethe High Priestess digest you.    If only things were different.    How sad!    But if I k*ll you,Lord Dio will shower me with praise.    So don't hate me!    Good grief, do I have to?    Just say it!    Come on, hurry, get on with it!    Say what?    I see...    Rose,    I wish I could've seen your face,if only once.    You might've been my type, too.    I just might've fallen for you.    I bet she's a beauty!    I can tell from that voice of hers.    Yes. She comes acrossas an elegant woman.    My fortune teller's instinctsenses it.    If you ask me, she soundsjust like Audrey Hepburn.    Man, if I were only   years younger.    You bastards! You don't meana single word of that!    I'll k*ll you all!    Holy sh*t!    Everyone, look!    What's that?    It's a tongue!    It's the Stand's tongue!Here it comes!    Jotaro!    Jotaro!    Jotaro's going to land in...    He landed right on the molars!    Jotaro! Get outta there!    You'll be crushed!    You want to pit your strengthagainst mine, do you?    Damn, such crazy power...    Jotaro! These teeth areas hard as diamonds!    You'll never be able to break them!    I'll crush you to death!    We have to save Jotaro!    Get outta my way!    That damn tongue again!    Magician's Red!    We're outta time!    Pull him out of there!    -Jotaro!-Jotaro!    HIGH PRIESTESSROSE    Those giant teethpulverized Jotaro!    Jotaro...    We didn't make it in time!    Hold on a sec.I think I hear something.    It sounds as ifit's coming from far away...    I think it's getting closer.    That voice belongs to...    The teeth!It's coming from inside the teeth!    Everyone, brace yourselves!    Huh?    They were hard as diamonds,and he still punched his way out!    Oh, my God!    And look!    He's busting the rest of them!    That show off...    His Stand's immense powernever ceases to amaze me.    C'mon, I'm getting usout of this hell hole!    Good grief.    Well, you were right aboutthose teeth being sturdy,    but they weren't sturdy enough.    Guess your so-called diamondswere a little low on calcium.    You couldn't pay meto do that again...    Hey, there's a womanpassed out over there.    I assume it's Rose,the user of the High Priestess.    Should we leave her?She looks harmless.    I think I'll go seeif she's hot or not!    Looks like she's gota pretty nice body.    Let's see...    Well? Polnareff?    No comment...    Stop! Don't look!    Her teeth are all busted!Don't even bother!    Well, we've finally made it to Egypt.    Indeed.    What would've takena mere    hours by plane,    ended up takinga whopping    days.    It's been quite the adventure.    We've gone inside a brain,and even inside our dreams.    Our dreams?    What do you mean, Kakyoin?    What's all this about dreams?It's morning, wake up already!    Oh, right. You guysdon't remember that.    Whatever. Let's go.    The Stand.    An otherworldly essence,powered by the mystical,    symbolized by the Tarot.    Around the World in    Days.    So was Joseph Joestar's descriptionof their globe-trotting journey.    From Tokyo to Hong Kong,they faced Tower of Gray.    On the seas to Singapore,    they tackled Dark Blue Moonand Strength.    In Singapore, they encounteredEbony Devil and Yellow Temperance.    In Calcutta, India, it wasHanged Man and Emperor.    In Varanasi, India, the Empress.    And near the Pakistani border,they fought Wheel of Fortune.    In the mountains of Pakistan,they battled Justice.    In Karachi, Pakistan, the Lovers.    In the desert ofthe United Arab Emirates, the Sun.    And in Saudi Arabia, Death   .    On a small island inthe Red Sea, Judgement.    And now, on the Red Sea floor,they've defeated High Priestess.    With several ofDio's assassins vanquished,    they have finally arrived in Egypt.    Only a few Tarot Cards remain.    But little do Jojo and crew know,    new threats lie ahead,ready to take our heroes on.    That's...    One, two, three... nine.    There are nine in all.Both genders...    Huh?    What... is that?    Have the meddlesome fliesswarming about been swatted?    The Speedwagon Foundation...    For pity's sake. I can't letmy guard down for a minute.    I've gotten quiteused to this body.    Tell me, Jonathan, can you feel it?    Your descendantsare inching ever closer.    It can be so cruel and unforgiving...    This wretched little world of ours.    So that's what's been going on!    Why didn't you just tell me Jotarowas helping you with work?    That's fantastic!    The boy still has a long way to go,compared with me.    So, this work is important enoughfor you to ask for help?    That's right.    It's my most important mission yet.    It's imperative thatwe don't mess up.    But as long as we work together,we should get the job done.    Say, Joseph.Could I speak to Jotaro?    Sure, but what about?    Nothing much.    Is it wrong that I want to hearmy darling grandson's voice?    Well, no.    Jotaro.    It's me.    Grandpa told me everything, Jotaro!    Work hard. And take care ofyour grandfather for me.    Will do.    I know in my heartif you work together,    you Joestar men can overcomejust about any hardship.    I truly believe that.    Grandma Suzie, you...    Hm? What's the matter?    You sound so seriousall of a sudden.    It's nothing.    All right, I'm hanging up.I look forward to good news. Ciao!    Madam...    It's already been    years    since I've workedfor the Joestar family.    But I can honestly say    we've never faced somethingof this magnitude.    Oh, come now, you're overreacting.    Didn't he sayit's just a business trip?    Well I...    It's so troublesomewhen men refuse to tell us anything.    But I'm used to it all by now.    The Joestar family has beenlike this for an entire century.    I'm sure if she were here,    she'd say the sameand laugh it all off.    What's the matter, Jotaro?    It's nothing.    All right, it's time to head out!    After a century,    it's time for us Joestars to bringan end to Dio's grip on our family!    But we don't have to do it alone.    Hey, Mr. Joestar!    We got the car!    Let's hurry and hit the road!    We should probablyget to where we're going    before it gets too dark.    Old man.    -Guess we are-If you don't hurry up,    -pretty lucky.-we're gonna leave you behind.    Yeah, yeah, we're coming.    This is the land of Egypt:a nation   % desert.    But, thanks tothe blessings of the Nile,    beautiful, fertile greenspreads across    the entirety of its river banks.    In addition to the cultureof the ancient Egyptians,    Egypt is home to Persian, Greek, Roman,    Muslim, and Arabian cultures.    All have lefttheir indelible marks.    In this eternal land,    what bizarre adventuresand challenges await Jotaro and crew?    EGYPT ARC
02x25 - Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'Doul, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:41It's about time.   EPISODE   : IGGY THE FOOLAND GEB'S N'DOUL, PART    What's that?  They're here.  It's a helicopter!  No need to tell us.  They're here fromthe Speedwagon Foundation.  They're looking forsomewhere to land.  Speedwagon Foundation?   The group looking after Momback in Japan?   Your old friends?   You got it.   Don't tell mewe're taking a copter now.   No. As much as I'd like to,they're not Stand users.   We can't put them in harm's way.   So why are they here?   They've brought us an ally.   What? An ally?   He's a bit of a handful;   that's why it tookso long to fetch him.   Mr. Joestar!   You aren't seriously consideringtaking him with us!   He'd only hold us back.   So you know him, Avdol?   Yes, all too well.   Hold on.You mean he's a Stand user?   That's right.And his card is the Fool.   The Fool?   The Fool?   Sounds like a dumb card to me.   Just be glad he's not your enemy.   You can't b*at him.   What'd you say, you assh*le?   You'd better watch your mouth.   It's the truth.   Now move your hand.You're hurting me.   -Who made you boss...-Enough!   The helicopter's here.   Good to see you, Mr. Joestar!   Thanks for bringing himall the way here.   So...   Which one of you is it?Who's the Stand user?   I said, which one of youis the Stand user?   You?   It's not us.   He's in the back.   The back ...   I don't see him.   No, he's there.   Hey, hey, hey!   Come on! Quit joking around.   Is he really short or something?   Come out, come outwherever you are!   Watch out!   Huh?   What's this sticky stuff?   Please, be careful, sir!   The helicopter ride was rough,so he's in a really foul mood.   Get away from him!   I told you he's trouble!   Polnareff, remember,you can't b*at him.   I'm just asking where he is...   Huh?   He's...   ...a dog!   Don't tell me this dog is....   Yes, this dog possessesthe Stand of the Fool.   His name is Iggy.   He's crazy about ripping chunksof hair out of people's heads.   I don't know where he's from.   But Avdol found him in New York.   None of the dog catcherscould catch him.   Avdol was the only one who could.   Oh, I should mention.   When he rips people's hair out,he sorta likes to...   ...pass wind in their faces.He's kinda dirty.   You little mutt!You're gonna pay for that!   Damn you...   Chariot!   That's...   So that's The Fool.   We fought an orangutan Stand userback in Singapore, but...   Who does this stupid muttthink he is?   Don't make me turn youinto dog meat!   What the--It turned into sand!   I can't cut him!   And now he's solidifiedand caught my rapier!   That's...   It's a Stand made of sand.   I see... So the simpler their makeup,the stronger they become.   I'm not sure I could land a punch.   Hey! Help! Get this dog off me!   Sorry, Polnareff,   but I thinkI'll hold on to my hair.   You monster!   Did you bring his favorite snack?   Of course. He wouldn't havecome with us otherwise.   Stop! Help me!   He has a keen sense of smell.    What is that?    Iggy loves coffee-flavored gum.    He'll do just aboutanything for it.    Mr. Avdol,hide the packet before you--    Blast it!He grabbed the whole thing!    He loves his coffee-flavored gum.    People on the other hand...    At least take the wrapping off.    Now how is he going to help us?    -Good grief.-Damn it...    He's ruined my beautiful hair...    This bastard!    He's distracted, as long ashe's chewing his gum.    Let's get the supplies out now.    Here's water and food for the trip.    Oh, thank you.    There are medical suppliesand a change of clothes, too.    Also, a new camera to usewith your Stand.    A lot easier thanusing a TV, right?    Oh, I know.    Hey, men!    Ah, the perfect memento.    Avdol! Hurry up with the gum!    But you're already such good friends,Polnareff!    All right, Mr. Joestar,we're heading back.    Before you leave,I have something to ask you.    It's about my daughter...    How is Holly holding up?    And don't hold back.    Yes, sir...    Well, I'm afraidshe's not doing well.    She's losing strength rapidly.Nothing they do seems to help.    Our doctors atthe Speedwagon Foundation    say she has two weeks.    There's no time.    Damn it...    I have some other informationas well.    Our investigators say that,two days ago...    nine unidentifiedmen and women gathered    in a building believedto be Dio's hideout.    Apparently they leftand disappeared.    Dio and nine others?    We have no informationon their identities.    The spy who reported thiswas then promptly k*lled,    and the mansion had alreadybeen vacated.    We were unable to locatethe nine men and women.    Our spies aren't Stand users,so we couldn't tail them.    What, they're Stand users?    Hold on.    They can't be.Except for the Emperor,    the only tarot cardthat remains is The World.    I suspect that is Dio's card, but...    Avdol?    I don't know.    I'm astounded.Nine more Stand users?    It seems, Dio's head has yet to adjustto his new body.    He would never run from us.He's far too conceited.    He's going to do everythinghe can to keep us out of Cairo.    Good grief. Nine Stand usersin two weeks, eh?    That's one hell of a whirlwind tour.    We'll be off, then.    Godspeed, sir.    Thank you. Look after my Holly.    That mutt...    So it sniffed outthe Great N'doul, eh?    So close.    I almost caught it this time.    Just a bit more practice and...    The Tsetse Fly...    It's because of these fliesthat Joestar and his friends    uncovered Master Dio's locationin Egypt...    THE FOOLIGGY    Mr. Joestar,do something about him!    Why does this piece of sh*tget to sit in the seat    while we're stuck in the trunk?    It's so cramped, my back hurts.    You'll just have to wait untilthat coffee flavor runs out.    When it has,    throw some more gum into the trunkto lure him back there    and switch seats.    All right, all right.Calm down! Damn it...    What the hell?    Look! Over there!    That's...    The helicopter!    The Speedwagon Foundationhelicopter went down!    I see no sign of expl*si*nor g*nf*re.    It looks like it justfell out of the sky.    Could it be?    Be careful!    You can bet it was att*ckedby an enemy Stand!    Look! It's the pilot!    He's dead...    And whatever happened to him,it wasn't pretty...    The poor fellow.    Approach carefully.    Something could be hiding there.    It's water.    All this water...and from one person's mouth...    No, the water must befrom his lungs.    Where'd the fish come from?    He drowned inthe middle of the desert!    What on earth?    Hey...    The other guy's over here.    He's alive!    Talk to us! Hang on!    Tell us what happened!    Wa...    Water...    What? You want water?    Polnareff, hand me that canteen.    Huh? Right.    Here, just hang in there.Here's some water.    Drink it slowly.    No! The water att*cked us!    What?    It's a Stand!    The enemy Standis inside the canteen!    Damn it!    They were just innocent bystanders.    Why did it k*ll them!    Avdol, did you seewhat kind of Stand it was?    All I saw was a hand.    But I think it's stillinside the canteen!    I haven't seen it leave.    Who could it be?    So Dio met withnine men and women...    Could one of them be the assassin?    Jotaro, find the Stand user.    I'm already on it.    But...    I don't seethe Stand user anywhere.    When we battledthat idiotic Sun stand,    he was hiding behinda mirror, but...    it seems this timethe enemy's far away.    Polnareff, slice up the canteen.    Huh? Me?    The pilot's head was suckedinto that tiny little container.    If I poke a hole in that thing...    No way!    Kakyoin! You're closer!    Just use your Emerald Splash!    I don't want to.    Don't make me do somethingjust because you don't want to do it!    What's going on with you?    No means no.    Well, I already told you,I'm not gonna do it, either!    That's the...    Kakyoin!    It's the water!    It had already left the canteen.It hid itself in the blood!    The Stand wasn'thiding in the water...    It is the water!    It got Kakyoin!    It got Kakyoin's eyes!    Polnareff! Don't panic!    Summon Chariotand protect yourself!    Crap.It's going to get Polnareff, too.    What's going on?It att*cked the pilot's corpse!    No, not the corpse. The watch.    It att*cked the watchbecause of the alarm.    Sound! It huntsits victims by sound!    Sound?    sh*t! Polnareff!    It's coming for you this time!    Get to the car!    It's so fast!    Hurry, Polnareff!    It got me!    Hermit Purple!    It disappeared into the ground...    It detects sound throughvibrations in the ground.    And it moves through the earthwhere we can't see it.    It can att*ck us from behind    or from below at any moment.    What's worse,the Stand user could be far away.    So they've sought refugeatop that car.    Seems they've realizedthat I, N'doul,    am hunting them with sound.    No matter.It's all futile anyway...    How's Kakyoin?    It's not good.    He may have been blinded.    Let's drive.    We have to get himto a doctor immediately.    But if we move, it'll att*ck.    We can't afford to be careless.    What?    Hm? That sound...    It's the dog.    It left the car before I att*cked.    It anticipated my Stand's att*ck.    Seems this dog is going to bequite the nuisance.    The tires are in the water! sh*t!    It's no use. It's pulling us in!    I can't hold on much longer!    Everyone, move to the back!    Hey, flea bag!    You're supposed to help us,damn it! Help, already! Hey!    That accursed dog...    It knows I'm four kilometersto the west of them.    Oh, what to do...    Perhaps I should do awaywith the dog first!    Go ahead, get comfortablewhile we fight for our lives!    You stupid dog!    No, forget the dog.    Joestar and the otherscan't control that mangy mongrel.    It's harmless.All it cares about is taking a nap.    Now, for the k*ll...    It's so sharp! That water justslashed our front tires!    Get back now!    So that's what it's trying to do...    sh*t! Everyone hang on!    I can hear it!    Don't make a sound.    He can smell where the enemy'sgoing to att*ck next.    The water started chasing Jotaro!    If we can just find their body,    there's a good chance we can defeatthat fearsome Stand!    It's Iggy.
02x26 - Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'Doul, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:42Everyone, hold on!  Oh no!  It sunk into the sand...Don't move!  Don't make a sound!  It's much too late now.  I know exactlywhere each of you landed.  Four... Five steps.  You're walking ever so quietly.  But I hear you.   These "steps" musthave thrown him.   Cursed water Stand!Go ahead and att*ck.   I'll vaporize youwith Magician's Red   the moment you show yourself.    EPISODE   :IGGY THE FOOL AND GEB'S N'DOUL, PART     He's here!   Wait. Why did he takeonly five steps?   Why has he stopped moving?   Now!   Magician's Red!   What?   What--   Avdol...   He's so...   So quick...   Avdol!   Ingenious indeed.   I must pay more attentionto their vibrations.   Those weren't footsteps.   It seems he threwring-like objects.   And these burns...   It must have been Avdol.   But he'll be a problem no longer.   Good bye...   -It's back!-It's back!   Avdol!   Hmm... someone is running now.   I don't believe it!Jotaro's running?   His stride tells mehe is about    ...   No,     centimeters tall.   He has a youthfulness to him.He's not Joseph.   It must be Jotaro.   But where is he running?   It dove in!   The water's after Jotaro!   So it's come to this.   It stopped attacking Avdol, but...   Jotaro! He's catching up!   I hear of all our enemies' Stands,   Jotaro's Star Platinum isby far the fiercest.   Master Dio will be delightedif I m*rder him.   With every fiber of my being,for Master Dio,   I shall defeat Jotaro!   Jotaro just picked something upoff the sand.   What was at that location?   What was it...   No, it's not inanimate!   It's the dog!Jotaro grabbed the dog.   He knows!   So that's your game.   You jumped out of the carbefore it was att*cked!   You can smell it! You know wherethe Stand's coming from!   Don't stop, Jotaro!   Time to earn your keep, Iggy.   Where's it coming from?Spill it, Iggy!   Or else we die together.   You won't get any gumfrom me, either.   Iggy!   He can fly?   Not so fast!   Go ahead, pant all you want.You're not getting out of this one.   My Star Platinum is fast.   You let me go,and I'll snap your neck.   What? He jumped and then nothing.   They haven't landed anywhere.   Impossible...   That's brilliant!   Jotaro's using Iggyto find the Stand user!   If we can find whoever'scontrolling the Stand,   we might actually havea chance of defeating him!   He's gone...   I can't hear Jotaro's footsteps.   Where is he? Where did he go?   Why can't I hear his footsteps?   They're flying lower and lower...   Looks like The Fool can't flylong distances.   It's gliding like a paper airplane!   My legs are about totouch the ground.   Hey, quit tensing up like that.   You're farting again.   You'd better notlet loose a big one.   I guess I have no choice.   Time to get a little more air.   That brought us a lot closer,   but the sound of that kickjust sent us back some.   Now he'll know we're flying.   So that's it! The dog's Stand...   can fly.   And they're...   heading this way!    I must k*ll Jotaro beforehe gets any closer!    His Stand is going after Jotaro!    He figured it out whenJotaro struck the ground!    All we can do now is trust Jotaro.    He's getting closer.    Sure, he was able tobring down a copter,    but he won't findour exact location.    Iggy's Stand makes barely a sound.    If I can just find the Stand userbefore touching the sand,    it'll be lights out for good!    Found him!    The Stand user's about    meters away!    Seems our enemy is blind.    It's sand!Sand's falling from the sky!    That's why he's hurling sandinto the air!    Not good!    He's locating us by listening tothe sand bounce off the wings.    Just like a submarine uses sonar!    I can hear you... I can hearthe sand bouncing off you.    I've found your coordinates.I know your altitude...    Jotaro!    GEBN'DOUL    sh**t him!    Star Platinum!    Star Platinum's speedmeans nothing.    If you can't determinemy direction of att*ck,    my Stand has the advantage!    Here comes another!    Iggy...    You damn dog...    That dog is dragging Jotaroright into my Stand's grasp!    It'll do anythingto save his own hide.    Even abandon his master!    Bastard...    -You little piece of...-Iggy...    That's what you get for relying onsuch a fickle creature, Jotaro.    The end has finally come.    Now, to put an end to your misery...    What? He's thrown something at me!    This wind shear...    What was it?    It's Iggy.    Come on, now.    You'd better use your Standsto defend yourselves,    or you'll both end up one big mess.    Such incredible velocity...    Damn! It's going to crash into me!    I can't believe it!He threw the dog...    Blast it! I was so closeto finishing Jotaro...    No!    I lost Jotaro's locationbecause of that damn dog!    Where is he?    He's not moving...    He's staying absolutely still.    This must be part of his plan!    Where are you, Jotaro?    Where? Show yourself, Jotaro.    Right here.    I see...    I didn't realizeyou had slinked so close.    If I hadn't protected myselfwith this water shield,    you would have alreadystruck me from behind.    I suppose I no longer needthis cane to hear you.    But I'll need itwhen I return home.    Iggy...    You knocked off my hat.    You know, I kept that hat oneven when I was scuba diving.    Don't worry. I went easy on you.    You'll live.    What? You used your own Stand to...    Why did you do it?    You thought you couldget me to talk...    tell you about the othereight Stand users, didn't you?    I know Joseph Joestar'sHermit Purple    can read people's minds.    I'll never tell you anything...    anything that you coulduse against him.    Dio...    Why are you all so loyal to him?    So loyal that you'd die...    Jotaro, I do not fear death.    My Stand has always enabled me    to live life unfetteredby a fear of death.    I could win any fight.    I could have and do whateverI wanted. No one could stop me.    k*lling, stealing...it meant nothing to me.    I'm sure that muttknows how I feel.    He was the first and only person    to instill in me a desire to live.    He was so strong, so wise,so beautiful.    He was the only one who sawa purpose to my existence.    I waited so long to meet him.    I will gladly die, but...    I will not disappoint him.    Evil needs an evil savior.    I'll tell you just one thing.    My name is N'doul.    My Stand hails from Egypt,birthplace of the Tarot.    One of the great Ennead,the nine gods of Egypt...    It is called Geb, god of Earth.    The nine Egyptian gods?    What do you mean?    I will tell you aboutmy Stand only...    After all, you are the onewho defeated me.    The rest stays with me...    Dio is like some charismaticcult leader...    Just who is he?    And the nine gods of Egypt?    It's all a mystery.    But we have to continue onward.    Hey, no need to be defensive.I'm not mad or anything.    I doubt you wanted to be    dragged out into the desertand forced into some human fight.    Guess I don't blame youfor being pissed.    Here, Iggy. Want some gum?    Calm down. I said I'm sorry.    Here.    Good grief.That dog's a pain in the ass.    Stay out here in the middle ofthe desert for all I care.    Iggy...    Well, what do you know.You picked up my hat for me?    Maybe you're not so bad.    Thanks.    Gum. Damn mutt...    You're no ordinary pooch.    Hey!    Jotaro!    Jotaro! Are you all right?    Good grief.    Oh? Is that a comic book?    Never seen one here before!    So Egyptians read comics, too?    Want some mini-donuts?     TASTY DONUTS    Hey... Um, can I see that?    I'm a comic book artist searchingfor inspiration.    I love rare books and comics.    Here, I'll let you usemy binoculars.    What's this? "Zenyatta MondattaBrothers Adventure."    I don't see the author's nameanywhere...    Wow.    Such weird pictures.    Great print quality,and in full color!    There once lived two brotherswho got along very well.    "My name is Zenyatta."    "My name is Mondatta."    Mondatta, the younger brother,was very shy    and wouldn't do anythingwithout Zenyatta.    He was always alone.    One day, while his big brother,Zenyatta, was away,    Mondatta met a very kind traveler.    The traveler gave Mondattayummy snacks,    and let Mondattalook through his binoculars.    Mondatta had so much fun.    "Oh, it's   :  !"    But the very kind traveler...    was impaled on a telephone poleand d*ed.    What a weird comic.    Is this comic popular here?    This book is so weird.    The rest of the pagesare all blank.    Nothing's printed...    Must be defective.    Somehow this comic hastotally pulled me in.    I know this sounds crazy,but could I buy this book from you?    -It's not for sale.-Huh?    My brother's book isn't for sale!    Now get lost.    Brother?    Didn't you hear me?    I told you not totalk to strangers.    There are lots of bad peopleout there, ya know.    Last call! The bus for Aswanis about to depart!    Let's go.    I heard they're heading    to the hospital in Aswanto drop off their friend.    I see...    I guess we can't domuch about that.    Then we'll have to waitfor the next bus.    We are unstoppable brothers!    Who's there?    It's me, Polnareff.    Jotaro, what happenedto your uniform?    You're acting weird today.    Could it possibly be that you're...    -Could it be...-Could it be...    Zenyatta, the predictionsare absolute.    Do your best!
02x27 - Khnum's Oingo and Thoth's Boingo / Khnum's Zenyatta and Thoth's MondattaQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:43Ah, new pages...  they came.  The brothers Zenyatta and Mondattatook a bus four hours later...  So they managed to avoid gettinginto an accident. Yippee!  What adventures await them now?  Once in Aswan,they made their discovery:  "Oh! There they are!"  "The five bad guys!",cried the brothers.  But the brothers wondered,"What are they talking about?"   The bad guys seemed so worried...   It's them.   Little did they know. They haddrunk tea laced with poison. Gulp!   Zenyatta...    So all I have to do is poison them.   Mondatta, you and Iare invincible together.   With your clairvoyant comic Stand...   and my face Stand...   my transformative ability...   They're as good as dead!    Our cards are Thoth,God of Writing,   and Khnum, God of Creation!   We're the ZenyattaMondatta brothers!    EPISODE   KHNUM'S ZENYATTA AND THOTH'S MONDATTA   In this café,   at that table... This is wherethey'll drink their poison tea.   My Stand, Thoth,the God of Writing, never lies.   So, how are they?   Luckily, Avdol's major arteriesweren't damaged,   so he'll probably bereleased tomorrow.   But Kakyoin's injuries are serious.   He could go blind.   I'm worried about him.   I hate to say it, but we might haveto leave him behind.   Hey, look at all these cafés.   We could all use a break.Let's get a drink.   Sounds good. Which one?   My cigarette says that one.   Welcome.   What would you like?   Let's see... How bout some tea.   Same.   Yes, sir.Three teas, coming right up.   No, scratch that.   -Huh?-Listen. We're in enemy territory.   This is Dio's dominion.   Who knows whenour enemies will att*ck.   We have to be more cautious.Someone could easily poison us.   From now on, we drink onlyfrom bottles and cans.   What? Are you serious?   I am serious.   Hey, forget the tea.We'll take coke instead.   Coke?   Yeah. Something wrong?   No. Okay. Coke, right?   Okay, three bottles of coke then.   Oh, and we'll open them ourselves.   Give me the third, fourth,and fifth ones from the right.   Now they want Coke?   How am I supposed to put poisonin an unopened coke...   Was the prediction wrong?   No, my brother's comicis always right.   I have to believe!I have to believe Mondatta!   If I can't stand behindhis predictions,   we won't have a chance!   Brother, my predictionsare foolproof!   Hey, you! This Coke's warm!   Is this your idea of a cold drink?I'm not paying for this, idiot!   Hey, the Coke's not cold?   The fridge is down so...   You're being paranoid.   Even if that guy was our enemy,   and even if he was tryingto poison us...   how would he have knownwe'd come to this cafe?   This city has tons of cafés,and I chose this one on a whim.   I could understandif this was the only café,   but there are tons of them.   My point iswe can't be too careful.   If you're that worried,let's go somewhere else then.   Let's go to the oneacross the street.   All right.   -Fire!-Huh?   My café is on fire!   Some fool left a burning cigarettein the road.   It ignited the trash!   Hey, sir.We'll take three teas after all.   We won...   But...   What kind of jerk would tossa lit cigarette near the trash...   They're drinking it!   Drink it all...   -They drank it!-They drank it!   A dog took my cake!   Who the hell broughta dog in here?   -Iggy...-Iggy...   Whose dog is this?   Hey! Get that dog outta here!   Damn it, Iggy!   Get back here, you!   Damn it! They were just aboutto swallow the poison!    sh*t! What's supposed tohappen next?    It hasn't come yet...    But the comic wasn't wrong.    Thoth sees the near future.    Next time we'll get them...    We'll k*ll them withthe next premonition!    That's right. We're...    the Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!    "That darn dog! We failed!"    "We were so close!",fumed the brothers.    Zenyatta and Mondattawere very mad.    But they didn't give up.    Zenyatta and Mondatta followedthe three guys and their dog.    While following them,    they met a man who had a facethat really made them angry.    It was exactly the kind of facethe brothers hated.    Something must havehappened to me in a past life    to hate guys like this...    It really pisses me off.He deserves a knuckle sandwich!    He was a perfectly nice man,but Zenyatta punched him anyway!    The man with the bad face ran away...    and left a wallet full of money.    "Yay! We're rich!    We're so lucky! Whoopee!"cried Mondatta.    What a fool.    We're rich!    Ah! Brother, another page.    The brothers continuedtheir pursuit.    The bad guys got in their carand headed to the hospital    to see their friendsAvdol and Kakyoin.    Zenyatta made a b*mbout of an orange    and planted it in the car.    Jotaro was blown to bits!    His head was split in two,and blood splattered everywhere!    Look how clearthe comic came in...    Yes!    KHNUMZENYATTA    My Stand, Thoth,can see only the near future.    But once the prediction's printed,it can't be changed! Ever!    Jotaro will blow up!    The b*mb will detonatethree seconds    after he sticks his finger into peel it.    It's destiny!    There's no way out!    -Who's there?-Wha--    Who's in our car?    It's not Jotaro?    No. Jotaro said he was goingstraight to the hospital.    -Be careful!-Crap...    Don't let him get away!    Crap! It's Joestar and Polnareff!    Hey, stop hiding in there!    Who are you? Come out.    I said come out, damn it!    Hurry it up!    Hey, what's the matter guys?    It's me, can't you tell?    Oh, it's you, Jotaro.    My Stand, Khnum,is a transforming Stand.    I can alter my height, weight,and scent to whatever I want.    I used my hairto recreate this hat!    But what happened?    You said you were goingstraight to the hospital.    Huh? Um, uh... Right, the hospital.    I forgot something, so I came back.    My wallet.I left my wallet in the car.    Good grief.    Jotaro, what happened toyour school uniform?    School uniform?    What? School uniform?    That's really nota good look on you.    Oh, my outfit.I mean my school uniform...    It's at the dry cleaners!    I took it to the cleaners,and didn't have any money.    That'll convince them. Yeah!    Huh. I see...    Then get in the car. Let's go.    Huh?    Huh? The car?    It can't be...    It can't be!    If I get into the carwith this face,    that means the real Jotarowon't get blown up! It'll be Me!    Impossible!    Nah, actually,I think I'm going to walk...    There isn't time, Jotaro!    It'll be fasterif you just get in the car.    Zenyatta!    Crap...    I've got to undomy Jotaro disguise,    or I'll be the onewho gets blown up!    That's it! I just need tothrow it away!    I'll get rid of this one    and put it back in the car later,    so it can blow up the real Jotaro!    I did it!    There! Now I'm safe!    Hey, it's Iggy!He's chasing our car.    He's got an orange in his mouth!Did you steal that, Iggy?    That'll make a nice giftfor Kakyoin and Avdol.    Wha-- Yow!    -"Yow"?-"Yow"?    I never thought I'd hear you saysomething like that.    You're acting strange.    No... Yow. You know, yow.    I was saying there wasa cyow over there...    Jotaro... You are actingpeculiar today.    Where's your usual cool self?    You're not actually...    a fake, are you?    Good grief. What the hell are youtalking about, Polnareff?    Are we at the hospital yet?    Hey, Jotaro.Show me that trick again.    That... trick?    What is he talking about?    The one you taught me.    You know, this!    Hey, you've gotten better.    Oh, that! You mean that trick.    Thank goodness!    I know how to do that!It's risky, but I can pull it off!    Sure! It's easy.    All right! Do the onewith five cigarettes!    Five?    Come on! Hurry up.I wanna see it again.    Crap! Damn that Jotaroand his stupid party tricks!    If I don't do it...    they'll really thinksomething is up.    They're already suspicious of me.    And Polnareff is about toset off the b*mb!    Fine! Dammit!    I'll do it!    Fine. I'll do five.    Come on, now do it!    I'm gonna do it!Fine, I'll do it, dammit!    Here I go! This is nothing!    Ow, hot!    Hot...    I did it! Hot damn, I did it!    There! Did you see that? I did it!    A man can do anything whenhis life is on the line!    Here.    Last time you drank juice withoutputting the cigarettes out.    Come on.    Aw, you blew it!    Jotaro, are you all right?Oh my God!    Brother! Mondatta!    Make that predictiongo away right now!    Tear up that page!    Zenyatta! The predictioncan't be changed!    Hurry up and go backto your regular self!    Undo the disguise andthe real Jotaro will blow up!    You can do it!    Jotaro, you're actingreally weird today.    I just... feel a bitunder the weather...    Crap!    I know their type.They're going to interrogate me    and realize I'm an imposter!    If they figure me out,they'll k*ll me.    And if I don't undo my disguise,    I'll blow up just likethe prophecy said!    That's it! I'll just pretend I'm sick.    I'll make them let me out ofthe car to relieve myself!    Jotaro, the way you'reclasping your hands...    You've got your left thumb on top!    Dammit!    Does Jotaro always clasp his handswith his right thumb on top?    What kind of person notices that?    What am I going to do?    That just proves you were a womanin your past life!    Since I put my right thumb on top,    I was a man in my past life!    Wow, really? I always putmy left thumb on top.    Sorry, Mr. Joestar.    Then that proves you toowere once a woman.    What do you mean, "proves"?    What do thumbs have to do with it?    That's so stupid!    Now I really feel sick...    They're driving me nuts!    All right. I'll tell themI've got a stomach ache...    Jotaro, let's see who can eatan orange the fastest!    What?    Hey...    No! Don't, idiot!    Whoa! What are you doing, Jotaro?    What's the matter, Jotaro?    Oh, it's nothing.    You really are acting weird.    Not that orange. Not that one.    Huh? Why?    Well, you know... Iggy found it.    He could've found it in the gutter.    Eat this one instead.    It's not dirty or bruised.It's fine.    Fine, I'll eat this one.You can use one of those.    -It hurts!-Huh?    -Hey.-My stomach hurts!    I have to go to the bathroom!My stomach hurts!    Stop! Hurry!    Oh, your stomach hurts?    I can't hold it anymore!Let me out!    I'll go behind that rock!    But the hospital's right there...    Just go ahead without me.    I mean it,I'll just catch up later!    Not so fast, Jotaro!    Here, toilet paper.    I...    I did it! I made it!    I got out of that car! I'm safe!    I'll go behind that rock andundo my disguise!    Who knows whereIggy picked up this orange.    Maybe it was lying in the gutter.    Do you want it?    No. Toss it.    Yes! Now I can use Khnum's powersto change back to normal.    And then we win!    The Zenyatta Mondatta brothers win!    We win!    Ah?    Oh, no!    Huh? What was that?    Who cares? Probably constructionor something.    Zenyatta...    Speak to me!    We lost, Mondatta.    No...    No! My Stand, Thoth,hasn't lost yet.    I'll k*ll them myself!    Mondatta...    Don't, Mondatta.    They're no ordinary guys.It's impossible.    I'm gonna do it!I've made up my mind!    I'll do it on my own!    I can do it!    You were always so shy...You've grown up, Mondatta.    I'll k*ll them all!    What does the book of Thothsay next?    That's them...    They're the ones who punched meand stole my wallet!    All right, guys!b*at them to a bloody pulp,    and I'll make sureyou're richly rewarded!    It's that guy!    Brother! I'm really scared!    Despite his burst of bravery,    Mondatta would have to waitto avenge his brother.    But don't give up, Mondatta!    Life has its ups and downs.    Huh?    Well, if it isn't Jotaro.    Hey. Took you long enough.    We took too long?    How'd you poop behindthat rock so fast?    I can't believeyou got here before us...    You even went to the dry cleaners?    What the hell are you two...    Hey, an ambulance.    Looks like someone's hurt.    That's too bad...    Oranges, huh?I was just getting thirsty.    I'll take one.    Oh?    That man's clothes...    Do you know him?    No, of course not.    Come on. Let's go find out howAvdol and Kakyoin are doing.    And so the brotherseventually gave up.    The battle was over,    and Jotaro and the otherswere none the wiser.    Ba-dum-tss.    Hey, look!It's a sword.    He's holding a sword.    It won't come out...It won't even budge.    I want to cut you down now, too.    Use me, and k*ll them.    Come at me with your Anubis Stand.
02x28 - Anubis, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:43Any improvement withyour injuries, Avdol?  Yes. But I am relieved to knowyou will be all right, Kakyoin.  Well I...  Luckily my cornea wasn't damaged,  so they expect meto make a full recovery.  I remember whenI was in middle school,  and my classmate wasstruck by a baseball  directly in the eye.  It turned out he wasfine the next day.   The eye only lost a bit of fluid.   Are you serious?   No!   The bandages will come offin a few days.   I'll catch up with you later.   It's less than     kilometersto Cairo... and Dio.   Everyone, you must be vigilant.   Hmm, what language isthis hospital bill in...   Arabic?   Man, it's so confusing!   The   is supposed to be five...The decimal is zero, and seven is a six?   And this wormy-looking one is...   A four. So, the amount we owe is...    Forty-six thousand three hundred fiftyEgyptian pounds?    That's insane!    He's adorable!   What is he I wonder?   He's so funny looking!   What in the world?He's chewing gum.   He must be waiting for someone.   Such a good little doggy!   And here I thoughthe was waiting outside.   Good grief.   So he's a hit with ladies, is he?   I wonder why he's chewing gum.   What a weird little puppy.   Um, hello?   Let me give you some advice.You'd best step away from that dog.   He may seem charming,   but he basically hates people.   If you're not careful,he'll make your--   Damn mutt!Get off of m--   -You stinking...-Ew! He tooted!   He's so cute!   You get along so well.   We don't get along at all!   Damn it, Iggy! Get off of me!   Catch you later, lovebirds.   Mr. Joestar?   Hey, hang on!   You...   You nasty little mutt!    In ancient Egypt,the dead were always buried    on the west bank of the Nile,where the sun sets.   That's why all Egyptian citiesstand on the east side of the Nile.   On the west, you'll findgraves and mortuary temples.   But our enemiesdon't care about east or west.   They'll come from all directions.   Your cows are far too lazy.   They're strong, though,I'll give them that...   Chaka! Get a move on!   Stop falling behind!   Damn it!   What kind of man are you?Are you really my son?   Your cows and your sonare just like you!   A sword?   What's it doing here?   Hey, look! It's a sword!   Give me that!   What? Someone must've dropped it.   Amazing someone left it!   This is incredible!It must be worth a fortune!   Hey, maybe the owner'sstill around.   He must've been in a major panic.   You don't think, it mightbe some kind of artifact?   Are you going toturn it in to the police?   Idiot! This could fetch usloads of money!   But I found it...   But if it's blunt,it won't be worth anything.   Come on! Pull it out.   Right!   What's wrong?   It won't come out!It won't budge!   Give it to me.   Here.   Hold that end.   Right.   It's no use.   The blade hasn't movedone centimeter!   Let me have a try.   Shut up!   How are you going to do it,if I can't, idiot!   My hand!   My hand! This gaping wound!   How? How did it cut me?   The blade wouldn't even come out!   The only thing I grabbedwas the hilt!   There's something strangeabout that sword...   Um... How about if I try now?   Fine! Go aheadand try already then!    It just came out.    But I didn't putany effort into it.    What...    I can hear the blade ringing...    I don't know much about swords,    but I've never seen a bladethis beautiful.    It's like a Japanese katana!    It glistens, like it's cloakedin ice-cold water...    What an amazing find!    Hey! Give it to me!You shouldn't be holding it!    Hand it over!    Hey, wha...    Why did you do it?    I don't know...    You were standingbehind me, Father.    It's not my fault...    What are you doing?Hurry!    We have to take him to a doctor!    This sword is evil!    It's like it has a mind of its own!    Be calm.    Let your heart grow still, Chaka.    Their deaths mean nothing.    Who are you?    I can't see you,but I hear your voice...    I am the Stand of the God Anubis.    Ruler of the underworld...    Deity of embalming,Lord of the dead...    You have unsheathed me.You shall be my Stand user...    You are my flesh!    You are a virtuoso.    I shall make you masterof the sword.    No one is stronger than you.    Wield me, and k*ll!    Father and that manboth deserved to die.    I think I'll hack youto pieces, too.    What?Hey, Chaka, stop!    Please stop!    Impossible!    The cow's unharmed...    Slaughter Joseph!Slice Polnareff!    Cleave Jotaro in two!    You are a fighting genius!A master of the sword!    No one is stronger than you!    The world is no matchfor your blade!    Kom Ombo?    Do we really have timefor this place?    Quit moaning.    They've allowed us passageon their ferry.    We must show our respect.    Come on, I'm starving!Let's get something to eat.    You never stop, do you? Here.This'll tide you over for now.    That's Iggy's!    Don't worry about it.Just take it.    By the way,where can I find a bathroom?    Shall we investigate?    Hey, mister, over here.    Want to buy some papyrus?    Papyrus is the original paper!Want a piece of Egyptian history?    Look, look! It's real papyrus!    Papyrus?    I'll give you a good price.    It's the real thing?    Of course, my friend.    A famous Egyptian craftsmandrew this.    Hm...    It's a fake. Real papyruswould never rip so easily.    You can't fool me.    Huh?    Where is Mr. Joestarand the others?    Huh?    Iggy? Why, you little...Hold it!    Hey! Where's my money?    That stupid dogjust gave me the slip...    Hey.    That's a pretty ballsy move...    Preparing to att*ck mewith so many people around.    Guys like you are rare.    Stand users don't usuallyshow themselves,    let alone facetheir attacker head-on.    It's quite noble, really.    I didn't think any of youwere like that.    Tell me your name.    I am Chaka.    My Stand is Anubis,Ruler of the Underworld.    Jean Pierre Polnareff,your life is mine.    My life is yours?    You certainly don't mince your words.    Your boldness is impressive,I must say.    Bring it on!    Let's see what your so-calledAnubis Stand is made of!    Chariot!    He's holding a sword, but...    Is he really going to fight me withthat instead of his Stand?    Something's strange.    His movements...That grip...that stance...    They're the hallmark of an amateur!Something's strange.    I need to be careful.    I need to keep my distance.    ANUBISCHAKA    What the hell?    The sword passedthrough the pillar.    And my shirt too!    He cut me withoutcutting my shirt!    I would've been k*lledif I hadn't stepped back.    You bastard! Chariot!    Stop hiding, and show... yourself!    Crap...    How could I? I lost him.    He could be hiding behindany one of these pillars.    His sword can pass through solid objects.    And my Chariot's striking rangeis only about one meter...    Damn!He's tougher than I thought.    I can't believethis jerk is giving me a run for my money    in sword fighting.    But you won't havethe advantage for long!    All right, Chaka, old pal!    Try and att*ck me now!    You can't sneak up on meif I'm not behind a pillar!    You're not gonna pop up outof the ground, are you?    What?    The pillar...    My sword need not passthrough objects!    I can cut throughthe pillar itself!    Die, Polnareff!    That was close.    Even Jotaro doesn't knowabout that technique.    Silver Chariotcan launch its rapier.    I have one chance only.    If the opponent dodges,I'm done for.    I use it only as a last resort.    No, I didn't k*ll you,    but I don't thinkyou'll be fighting again.    That's strange...    The sword's back in its scabbard.    Did it just slip back in by chance?    Now that I see this sword up close,    I see its beauty.    I must unsheathe it...    Hey, Polnareff. There you are.    You worried us,going off like that by yourself.    We thought you'd been ambushed.    Polnareff?    Huh? Oh.It's you, Mr. Joestar.    My mind's so fuzzy...    Maybe it's frombeing tossed around,    or maybe it's fromall these wounds.    Polnareff, why are you squatting?    You step in some poop?    Wait? Where'd you find that sword?Did something happen?    Yeah...I was just fighting that jerk.    What? An enemy Stand user?    It's over now.    He said his Standwas the god Anubis.    It was a Stand that couldphase through objects and cut them.    He was a powerful opponent.    "But, of course,he was no match for me."    Polnareff reassured himself.    He att*cked me with this swor--    Huh?    It's gone?    Rats are runningoff with the sword!    Hey!    Talk about creepy...    So rats steal stuff here?    If you want to steal,go steal some damn cheese!    That's odd...    Now the sword's stuckin the scabbard.    Polnareff!    I'm glad you're all right,    but don't ever run offby yourself again.    It's too dangerous!    They'll att*ck if you'realone for even a few seconds.    Oh, no! That's our ship!    Let's hurry.We need to get to Edfu today.    Wait. Hey!    Polnareff...    So you brought the sword?    I'm turning it in to the police.It is a dangerous w*apon.    Good, we can't take any chances.    Who knows who mightpick it up at those ruins.    Besides, it's likely to beextremely valuable.    Hey, Iggy! Quiet!    We could get kicked out of here!    What the hell is with you today?    Well, since this damn dogwon't shut up,    I think I'll take thisto the cops now.    Polnareff! I thought we told younot to go off on your own!    I just told you!Jotaro, go with him.    Right.    Hey.Shouldn't we get to the police station?    Oh, come on!    A man's got to lookhis best, right?    Oh, right.    Excuse me, would you putthis sword over there?    Certainly.    That thing's a dangerous w*apon.    Anyway, I was rolling around a bitand got kinda dirty.    Make this handsome face gorgeousagain will you, Mr. Barber?    Certainly.    Ow...    Hey, watch it!That razor's dull.    Sharpen that thing!    This is supposed to bethe most relaxing part!    Good grief.What a prima donna.    That so? My apologies.    Good!    Much better.Now that's a shave.    So very... glad to hear, sir.    Très bien!    Now under my chin, too.    Certainly.    Right here...    under your chin, yes?    Under the chin!Right, Polnareff?    What?    It's me, you fool.The Anubis Stand!    Grr!    The sword itself is a Stand!    I won't lose to someoneI've faced before!    He's strong...    The more I fight him,the faster his att*cks become.    The look in Polnareff's eyes...    I'll have...    your head!
02x29 - Anubis, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:44Under the chin, right, Polnareff?  What?  It's me, you fool.The Anubis Stand!  Now what?  Die!  I'll shave your jaw clean off!  Who the hell are you?  And what've you donewith the barber?  Could that sword possibly be…   Could it be the Stand?   Is it controlling the barber?   So the guy at Kom Ombowasn't the Stand user!   Polnareff…   Either way,I'm still stronger than you!   He's so strong…   I learned Chariot's movesand powers during our last battle!   I won't lose twiceto the same opponent!   Come on.    Come on, you've almost got it.    EPISODE   : ANUBIS, PART     Oh?   Polnareff and Jotaroseem to be taking a while.   Polnareff, what's…   Is this barber a…   Stay back, Jotaro!   This sword is the Stand.   It's too dangerous to useStar Platinum's bare fists   against this blade.   The barber isn't the Stand user!He's just a puppet.   Not to mention,   this Stand's even stronger now!   You bastard!   Whoa, there.   Too much to handle?   Now I know the limitsof your defense.   Let's see if you can survivemy next att*ck, Polnareff!   Polnareff!   He's getting stronger…with every strike!   I can't keep parrying.   He's going to get me!   Now!   Take this!   What?   I know all your moves now.   It doesn't matterwho my wielder is.   If I fought you once…   I never…   ever lose twice!   It's no use.Without my rapier I'm dead…   sh*t! Help, Jotaro!   Star Platinum!   Think he's through?   No, that was a shallow punch.   And it took just abouteverything I had.   -Hey, Khan. Are you all right? Hey…-sh*t. This guy's strong.   We haven't seenone like this in a while.   A stand that doesn'trely on gimmicks…   Just pure power.   Not bad, Star Platinum.   So the rumors are true.You're swift.   But now that I've seen it,I can b*at it.   What's wrong, Khan?   Stay back!   He's being controlled!   If you want to remain in one piece,get back in and hide!   We're in major trouble, Jotaro.   The more we fight,the faster it gets.   Its next att*ck will beits fastest,   and strongest yet!   Move, Polnareff.   It's me he's after!   Run, Jotaro!   Die!   He caught it withhis bare hands?   To take that risk is…   Now I know.   The true source ofStar Platinum's strength   isn't its speed and precision.   It's Jotaro's split-seconddecision-making ability   and nerves of steel.   Now I know…   Is he dead?   No, he's just unconscious.   Jotaro, don't touch that sword!   You snapped it in half,   but the Stand's powersmight still be lingering.   Unsheathed, the sword controlsanyone who touches it.   Let's get the blade back inwithout touching the hilt.   Now what?   If someone ever draws it out again,we're done for.   This thing's alreadylearned our abilities.   We won't get any second chances.   How about tossingthe freaking thing into the river   to live at the bottom of the Nile?   The bottom of the Nile, huh?Sound's good to me!   Hold it! Police!   Perfect timing.This guy needs a hospital…   I have reports of a brawlat the barber shop!   What are you doingwith that sword?    Hand it over!    Hey, stop!    Don't pull it out!    Polnareff!    No!    His eyes… that stare…    He's under the sword's spell.    Hey! You drew the sword!    I drew the sword?    Officer, you should reallybe more careful.    And you call yourselfa servant of the law?    Hey, what are you doing?    You're the one who drew it!    I don't know who you areor where you're hiding,    but it's clear Polnareff'sunder your control.    I've never foughtagainst Polnareff.    And with Chariot I won't be ableto pull any punches.    I could end up k*lling him.    Don't forget that I, Anubis,    have already witnessedall of Star Platinum's moves.    If I've fought you once,    I never lose twice!    Hey, now.    His speed… it's incredible!    He's getting faster.Soon he'll outpace me!    I have to stop his sword!    I've got to catch the blade again!    It sped up!    I'll take your head!    Wha...    Such speed and power.    It's the fastest StandI've ever faced.    At this rate I'll lose.    I have to fight Polnarefffull force, or I'm dead.    So you head butted the sword away    after you realizedyou'd failed to catch my blade…    I almost had you.    I was so close.    But…    I've learned that skill now, too.    Jotaro.    You think you can k*ll Polnareffand live, don't you?    Such wishful thinking. How naive!    Because… what I'm about to show youwill end all of this!    Can you…    b*at this, Jotaro?    Behold the Silver Chariotand Anubis…    two-sword technique!    ANUBISKHAN    Dammit…    This extra sword,his accelerating speed…    Even my Star Platinum…    What's the matter?A bit winded, Jotaro?    I'll stop him before he kills me!    Star Finger!    My right arm is as lightas a feather now.    Interesting.I guess that was one option…    You look surprised.    Round two! Armor release!    You fool!Your "ora ora" is no match    for two swords wieldedby two master swordsmen!    Your stomach is wide open!    I've got you now!    I did it! I win!    Master Dio!I've exterminated Jotaro!    I, the god Anubis, have k*lled him!    Victory!    Don't think you'll be able to stopthe blade or pull it out.    I've already surpassedStar Platinum.    Now for the final thrust…    The final thrust?    Precisely!    I'll slice open your bowels!And Master Dio will rejoice!    Stop.    Don't drive the blade inany further…    It'll be m*rder.    No mercy!    I'll spill your gutsonto the pavement!    What?    You're breaking me!I have to pull free!    Stop!    Weren't you saying somethingabout slicing me open?    I told you it'd be m*rderif you drove that blade in any further…    your m*rder, that is.    You're an easy targetwhen the sword is still.    What a pain…    This last att*cktook everything I had.    Luckily it was enough to defeat him    before he could learn itlike all the rest.    I've never been so exhausted.    I have to find Avdoland the old man, fast.    What just happened?    The sword didn't possess me,did it?    Yeah… But it's over.    Forgive me…    Polnareff, get the old manand Avdol.    I can't walk. I'm too tired.    Wow, it's shiny…    Now I've learned that trick, too…    My Stand user was the swordsmithwho forged me     years ago.    He perished long ago,but I survive.    I am a Stand with no master.    Master Dio found me and saved mefrom the shadows of the museum.    Master Dio's Stand, The World,is far more powerful than me.    That's why I pledged my loyalty.    Jotaro,    I swear, I'll m*rder you!    I know your strength.    Your speed…    You'll never see it coming!    I'll s*ab you in the back!    Die, Jotaro!    What?    No! I missed!A dog tripped me?    Where did that mutt come from?    Hey, Iggy.    What are you eating?A lollipop?    Eating right off the ground again…Filthy mutt.    That river is…    The Nile River!    No, this can't be happening!    I'm heading right for it!    If I fall into the river,I'm done for! I'll rust away!    Somebody stop me!    Ah ha! A wall!The wall will stop me!    Lucky me!    What?    No! I was so panicked,    I went right throughthe wall by accident!    I'm going to fall in!    Yes! It's a ship!I'm saved!    If I wedge into those planks,    that guy's curiositywill make him pull me out.    Then, I'll take over his mind!    I'll use his bodyto take revenge on Jotaro!    Ack! A cow's on board?    Wait! Calm down! Hey!    Cool it, you stupid cow!    I know!I'll take over the cow's mind!    And then…    I won't make it in time!    Hey, look.That cow is going berserk!    Good grief.Who cares about a damn cow?    Just go get the old man and Avdol.    Help me!    Hey, fishies. Come here.    Come on, swim to me.    Hey, wait! Where are you going?    Hey, Mr. Crab.    Do me a favor and take me ashore.    I'll give you something yummy.    Wait! Don't leave me, Mr. Crab!    I'll be rusted throughin a couple of days!    Help me!    Don't leave me!    I'm so alone!     ANUBIS DEFEATED    Stupid mutt.    What are you staring at?    There's nothing to eat over there.    Wha...    You stinking…    What the hellhave you been eating?    Polnareff…    To think,all that happened without us.    The Anubis Stand, huh…That must have been rough, Jotaro.    Yeah…    -Stop!-I'm never going anywhere...    -Get off of me!-...with him again.    Stop it already, you stupid mutt!

02x30 - Bastet's Mariah, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:44Good morning!  How are we feeling today,Mr. Kakyoin?  Well, this new way of lifehas certainly set me on edge.  Any further discomfort?  No.The painkillers must be working.  Good. That's excellent news.  Morning, Kakyoin.  Doctor, these bandages...  How much longerdo I have to keep them on?   I don't have much time.   Kakyoin, you will recover,   but this is nothingto take lightly.   You will need to remain in our carefor a little while longer.   For how long, well, I'm afraid,I'm unable to say.   Oh I'm kidding!   You need time to heal.   But, well, for some reason,   the Speedwagon Foundation doctorsrecently contacted us.   They've asked that we entrustyour care to them.   Though I'm sure their state-of-the-artmedical treatments   will prove effective.   Who exactly are you, anyway?   The Speedwagon Foundationis world-famous.   I can't imagine they'd wantanything to do   with an ordinaryhigh school student.   Let's just say I havea very dependable friend.   Thank you, Mr. Joestar.   I guess it won't be longbefore I see you after all.   Jotaro, Polnareff, Avdol, Iggy...   Hang in there.    EPISODE   : BAST'S MARIAH, PART     Located along the Nilein Southern Egypt   is the city of Luxor.   To the ancient Egyptians,it was the site of Thebes.   And it is here,on the west bank of the Nile,   where the pharaohswere once laid to rest.   Today we call this sacred sitethe Valley of the Kings.   The tomb of the greatTutankhamun lies here,   in the Valley of the Kings.   Wow, this place is full of history.   Apparently,some residents of this area   still dig beneath their houses   in search of treasure withoutpermission from the government.   You think there areany undiscovered   tombs or treasure left?   Perhaps.   Hey, where'd the old man go?   To the bathroom.   He's with Iggy, so the dog willalert him to anything unusual.   Bathroom?   Do you need to go?   If it's a normal bathroom.   It's so arid here,   the crap dries upand turns to dust...   Instead of water,this toilet uses wind?   And there's no toilet paper.   Wait, is this...   some kind of sand bidet?   You wipe your ass... with sand?   Desert sand is sterile.   I think I'll pull a Polnareff   and wait untilwe get back to the hotel.   What's the point of this shack?Might as well go behind a rock.   This is weird even for Egypt.   This makes no sense.   Why is there an electrical outletin the rock?   I wonder what it's for?   There's no electricity here...   It shocked me...   Mr. Joestar, are you all right?   It's time to leave.   Huh? Right...   Got it. I'll be right there.   That scared the living daylightsout of me...   I can't believe it was live.   I guess the cables rununderground?   God only knows.   This place is surreal...   Card of the Goddess BastStand User: Mariah   You know what they say...Curiosity k*lled the cat.   We could make it to Cairoin two days,   but we're all injuredand exhausted.   Why don't we take tonightand tomorrow in Luxor   to recover somewhat?   Sounds good to me.Ever since we got to Egypt,   the enemy Standshave been getting stronger.   We've been winning by a hair.   Hey, Mr. Joestar,is something wrong?   My prosthetic's acting up.   I probably just needto oil the joints.   Hey you! That radio's busted!   That's odd. It's made in Japan,and I just bought it...   It's just static!Turn that thing off!   Mr. Joestar?   Yeah, I suppose we shouldrest up before heading to Cairo.   But don't let your guard down.   All right. Let's find a hotel.   How strange.   Thanks, mister.    Come again!    Hey, now it's working again!    What the...The hammer's so heavy...    What?    The nails! It hurts...    Did you bang your finger withthe hammer or something?    Watch out!    You can't just go throwinghammers around!    Geez...    Mr. Joestar...    Mr. Joestar... Wake up.    Hey, hurry up!    Polnareff won't stop blatheringabout getting breakfast.    Hurry and wake him up, Avdol!    Tell him he's got five minutes!    I thought old people get up early!    Damn smart-aleck. Has no respect...    Tell him I'll be down in a minute.    As you wish.    Did my watch stop?    But you know, Mr. Joestar...    For a man of your age,    your sleeping habitsare quite remarkable.    You're facing the wrong way.    You went to bed facing south,but woke up facing north.    A sign of youthfulness, perhaps?    I'll be downstairs.    Something's strange...Ever since yesterday afternoon...    My hand's still acting up, too.    What's wrong with this chair?It's moving on its own!    Could these floors be slanted?    For such a pricey hotel,it's sure made on the cheap.    Where should we go today?    Karnak was amazing,so I'd say something like that.    It's a little far, but how aboutthe Valley of the Queens?    What do you think you're doing,you old pervert?    Weirdo!    What just happened...    Oh, my. You naughty man.    You need to workon your approach, but...    You're j-u-s-t my t-y-p-e...    Smooch!    Something wrong!Something's really wrong!    Things have been offsince yesterday afternoon!    What?    It's...    It's stuck...    Is metal sticking to me?    Is that why metal objectsare flying toward me!    Has my body...    My body...    has it turned into a magnet?    Ow!    Is this...The work of a Stand?    But why?Why can't I see it?    How could these knives and forksfly at me without a Stand nearby?    Could it be...    Is this because of the socket onthat rock from yesterday?    That shock?    I can't pull free...    Oh, no!This escalator's made of steel!    The magnetic pull is gettingstronger by the minute!    What?    Hey, you!You in the micro-miniskirt!    You've got to help me!    Your chain's wrapped around me!    I'm getting pulled intothe escalator!    Push the emergency stop buttondown below!    Hurry! The chains arepulling me tighter...    This thing's gonna rip offmy hands and feet!    Hey, are you listening?    Have fun, Joseph Joestar.    What? So it's you...    You're the Stand user!    BASTMARIAH    So it's you...    You're the Stand user!    Once you've made contact    with the magnetic fieldof my Stand, Bast,    there's no escape.    Someone!Someone stop the escalator!    That's it!    I'll push the emergencystop button...    With my Hermit Purple!    What? Where's the stop button?    Does this escalator not have one?    Dammit!    This escalator doesn't havean emergency button!    I'm getting pulled in!    My neck!    It's gonna cut off my head!    I'm done for!    -It's gonna sever my head!-Ahem!    -This is it! I'm gonna die!-Mr. Joestar. Ahem!    Hello, Mr. Joestar.    -I'm gonna be decapitated...-Ahem.    ...by the escalator!    The escalator stoppedquite some time ago.    I pushed the emergencystop button.    It's on the side.    All good!    I just finished inspectingthis escalator.    Nothing's wrong!    The emergency buttonworks just fine!    Oh, are you the managerof this hotel?    Could you sign here please?    What's going on, Mr. Joestar?    It's a Stand.An enemy Stand's got me.    My body is like a magnet now...    She turned me into a magnet!Metal sticks to me!    Pull this thing off me!    The magnetic pullkeeps getting stronger...    That's her!That woman is the Stand user!    -What?-We have to stop her!    I have to somehow get rid ofthis insane magnetic pull,    or I won't be able to move!    Let's get Jotaro and Polnareff!They're outside.    What?    -It's... so heavy...-Avdol?    There's no time to get them!    She's getting away!    Mr. Joestar, don't stay! Go!    Right!    I have to get a good look at her!    This is...    She went intothe Ladies' Room.    Now what?    I'm going in.    My life's on the line!    -I have to catch her!-Mr. Joestar?    The old man's still not back?    Yeah, Avdol went to get him,but he's not back, either...    Oh no!    They sneaked off...    to have an amazingmeal without us?    He's just taking his timein the john.    Look, if they don't show upin the next five minutes,    we'll go look for them.    Oh, yeah. The bathroom.You're probably right...    Come to think of it, the bathroomsin this hotel are spotless...    Mr. Joestar,now that we're in here...    Just as I expected.    -We've got a problem on our hands.-Shh!    Shh...    Forgive me, but I haven't a clue...Which one do you think she's in?    She's got amazing legs.    Her legs?    Yes! Look for those legs!    You can't miss them.    We're going to peek?    No.    Nope...    And no again.    Mr. Joestar, here!    Come here! Are these her legs?    Oh, my. You're that handsome fellowfrom before.    You've come looking for me here?    Ooh! Such a filthy man...    Smooch!    It's that hag again!But she was on the second floor!    This isn't good!    We got the wrong person.This is very troubling...    How could you screw that up?    -Avdol, run!-Wai--    Perverts!    I don't deserve this!Polnareff's the one who should be    getting called a pervertin the Ladies' Room!    -Dirty old man!-Disgusting!    Perverts!    How scrumptious!    She's headed that way!    Damn it. How'd she get so far?    After her!    Avdol, I forgot to tell you,    but don't touchany electrical outlets.    No matter where they are!    That's her Stand!    You'll get zapped,and then the magnetism will get you!    I'm afraid I already did,Mr. Joestar.    What? Where?    When I pushed the emergencystop button on the escalator...    There was a socket next to it.It got me!    That little tramp...    Mr. Joestar, could you pleasegive me some space?    I can't run with youstuck to me like this.    You move, Avdol!    What are you talking about?    You're the onewho's running close to me!    Two magnetsnext to each other will...    stick together!    I can't believe she turned meinto a magnet too...    Mr. Joestar, we're in...    ...big trouble, I know!    She's so...    She's so...    ...strong!    My body, too, became a magnet...    We can't help it!We're both in her power now.    What a strong woman!    What should we do? At this rate...    I've never backed downfrom a fight!    I'm just going... to keep on fighting!
02x31 - Bastet's Mariah, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:45Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  That's her!That woman is the Stand user!  Oh, my. You naughty man.  You need to work onyour approach, but... Smooch!  Avdol, I forgot to tell you,  but don't touchany electrical outlets.  I'm afraid I already did,Mr. Joestar.  What?  Two magnetsnext to each other will...   stick together!   Mr. Joestar, we're in...   ...big trouble, I know!    EPISODE   :BAST'S MARIAH, PART      Hey! Wait!   Damn it...   She just turned the corner!After her!   Blast it! I can't believemy body's become a magnet, too!   Calm down, Avdol!   Getting hysterical won't help us.   Just focus on how to defeatthis Stand!   Now where is that woman?Damn it!   I don't see her.   Well, we can't stay herelike this forever.   Let's slowly try to stand up.   Very well.   All right, we did it.   Now, let's try to pull awayfrom each other.   Since we're stuck together,   the magnetic force holding ustogether is double.   Let's get to that fence.   Then we'll grab onand pull away from each other.   We can do it, Avdol!Get those stomach muscles ready!   Stay in sync!   Right, Mr. Joestar.   -One!-Two!   Mr. Joestar... I have to say,this is quite embarrassing.   Hey! What do you thinkyou're looking at?   We're practicing our dance moves.It's called dancing!   What a perfect dayfor dancing outdoors!   Now scram, damn it!   All right.Almost there, Avdol.   -One, two, and...-One, two, and...   We did it!We made it without falling!   Indeed...   Avdol, think you can slide off me?   Yes, I might be able to.   All right...   I'll hang on to the fence,and you slide down.   Free yourself once you're atthe tip of my foot.   Look, our faces are stuck together,so that means   my feet and your headshould repel each other.   Right...   NEGATIVE POSITIVEPOSITIVE NEGATIVE   All right! That's it.   What's wrong, Avdol?   Isn't this position a bit...   It's highly suggestive...   If anyone sees us,they might think...   No one's looking!Hurry up and slide off my...   They brought their friends!   Hey! Get lost, brats!Stop looking at us!   Hey! I said b*at it, you damn...   Avdol, hurry!Hurry up and get off me!   I'm trying...   I can't believethis is happening to me!   The embarrassment!   Fine, then I'll move!   Mr. Joestar, slow down!   Mr. Joestar, if you move like that...   It's that old hag again!   I come back for my handsome manand find this?   How dare you toywith a maiden's heart?   Cheater!   Hurry! Hurry, Avdol!The tears are coming!   You scoundrel!   Wait... This is a misunderstanding!   We did it!   We need to stay far apartfrom each other!   Your magnetic pullis getting stronger.   Curse you, damned fool!Go to hell!   There she is. It's her.   Look at her, smoking a cigarette...   Avdol, you go from that side.   Don't let her get away this time.   She's cunning.   This may be a trap.   No, Mr. Joestar...   It seems we've already falleninto her trap!   Railroad tracks!   My foot is stuck!   We're...   stuck...   -together again!-together again!   Son of a bi--   Mr. Joestar, something's...   That sound...Oh, no! We can't stay here!   Avdol, use Magician's Redto burn through the tracks!   We need to get out of here now!   But, Mr. Joestar...    It's coming! The train's coming!Hurry up and melt these tracks!    I can't.If I burn away the tracks...    The train will derail,and innocent people will die!    She's pure evil...    I could try to grab herwith my vines,    but she's out of range.    I might be able to pull us freeusing this post...    It's no use!    The magnetic pullis even stronger now.    Mr. Joestar, keep pulling!Keep trying!    It's coming! Pull harder!    Now what?    I win.    BASTMARIAH    I've won, Lord Dio!    Now to k*ll Jotaro and Polnareff!    Good thinking, Avdol!    You b*rned throughthe railroad ties    and dug a hole!    This is it!    This suits the imageof Mohammed Avdol!    This is the rolemy character plays!    Clever little bastard...    You...    sh*t-eating b*tches!    Magician's Red!    Hermit Purple!    I've got you!    Now, young lady...    I regret that I'm now goingto strangle you enough    to put you in the hospitalfor a week.    Your magnetism is rathertroublesome, you know.    What are you imagining?My chest didn't get bigger...    Your magnetism just got stronger.    This is what I had in my pockets.    The weapons I had in my pockets!    Mr. Joestar, duck!    Magician's Red!    Your magnetic force will keepgrowing stronger...    Until your bodies are crushed.    She's getting away!    No, she's not escaping.    She's keeping a certain distancebetween us.    I'm sure that woman fights by    staying neither too closenor too far.    If she gets too close to us,she'll be caught.    If she goes too far,the magnetism stops working.    This magnetismis the work of a Stand,    so it follows the rules of Stands.    Once the user is too far away,its power weakens!    What shall we do?    She said the magnetismwould keep getting stronger.    Shall we flee untilthe magnetic force expires?    No. Even if we were ableto escape this magnetism,    it won't meanwe defeated the Stand.    I, Joseph Joestar,    have strategically retreated fromfights in my younger days,    but I've never onceabandoned a fight.    I'm going to keep fightingwith all my might!    This is a map of the city.Right now, we're here.    The woman is here.    If she continues down this road,    she'll loop aroundand head back this way.    We'll split up    and catch the woman here.    I won't think of heras a woman anymore.    I'll get her, no matter what!    After her!    Hey, look.    The rails have been cut...    People from the city have arrived.    I'm sure they'll report the damagebefore the next train comes.    Let's go!    Seems like something's going on.    Someone cut the rail line!    Will the trains be okay?    They've stopped running for now.    Someone cut the rail line?    That's a pretty crappy thing to do.    Why would someone do that?Are they stupid?    You know, Jotaro...    I think people like thatwill get what they deserve.    I spent three months' pay on this.    Let's get married!    Oh, my...    Huh? Wait, what?    Huh?    They're chasingas fast as they can...    But they'll never catch me.    Stay calm. Gotta stay calm...    Looks like you can barely move now.    You won't be able tochase me anymore.    You think so?    I know these roadsbetter than you do.    Look behind you.    It's a pincer att*ck!    We've finally cornered you.    Now, at the last moment,the tables have turned!    A pincer att*ck?    You still don't get it.    You think you've cornered me,but it's you two who are cornered.    Look above you!    High voltage power lines!    Crap! Power lines are...    That's right.Power lines are magnetic.    You'll burn to a crisp!    Magician's Red!    Hermit Purple!    Avdol can defend himselfwith his flames, just barely,    but you have no chance, Joestar.    My Bast's power is far greater...    than your Hermit Purple's!    Woman, my flames will roast you!    Something's pulling me!My whole body's being pulled!    What is this?    I control flamesthat can melt steel,    but I can't defendmyself from this...    My body is being crushed!    I can't keep this up!    Joseph Joestar,since this is the end, I'll tell you...    You were quite amazing.    We've only known each otherfor a few minutes,    but you are witty and canny,and your experience gives you    the good judgmentthat young people lack.    You've gotvery charming looks, too.    Our ages are quite far apart,    but I might not have mindedbeing with you.    That's great...    Would you mind saving me, then?    Hmm...    You're a lot more powerfulthan my Hermit Purple!    I can't hold on much longer...Please. Stop the magnetism!    Well...    Nah, I don't think so.    You're nowhere near as charmingas Lord Dio.    Is there nothing that willconvince you to stop the magnetism?    No, not happening.Sorry, but you have to die.    Even though I'm begging you?    You're much too persistent,you fool.    Then you've lost, young lady.    What?    Shi--    We told you this wasa pincer att*ck!    Magnets are attractedto each other.    Once you were between us,your luck ran out.    She can't hear you, Mr. Joestar.It looks like she's passed out.    She's been crushed bythe weight and magnetic force.    I'm sure she's brokenmore than a few bones.    Now, then...Shall we go get some breakfast?    Certainly. I'm rather hungryafter all that running around.    It's already  :   a.m.    sh*t-eating b*tches...    MARIAHBAST    ALL BONES BROKEN,ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL.     UNABLE TO RECOVER.(MUST RETIRE)     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    They're taking forever...    What the hell are they doing?    They're taking longer thana woman getting dressed.    It's almost  :   a.m.    They might haveencountered an enemy.    Maybe we should go look for them.    Yeah. Good grief.    Come on, Iggy.

Come with me to the bathroomand take off your clothes.    Well done.    I'll help you take them off.    -Well done.-I'll apply some ointment.    Well done.    Is this really okay?    Well done...
02x32 - Set's Alessi, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:46First, let's rewind a bit.  While Joseph and Avdolwere fighting Mariah,  Jotaro and Polnareff were...  Here you go, ma'am.

I, Alessi, shall k*llJotaro and Polnareff.   Tenacious buggers!   I'll do whatever it takes.   Attaboy, Alessi.   Name: Alessi   Stand: Set, god of storms and chaos   Favorite phrase: "Attaboy!"   Polnareff, keep your guard up.   Forget who you're talking to?   Mr. Joestar and Avdolseem to have gone.   And it doesn't seem likethere was a struggle.   Old man. Avdol. Anyone home?   Jotaro.   I have a bad feeling about this.   Yeah.   That looks so good.   Come on, let me have a bite.   All right, here.   -Huh?-My sandwich!   Hey! Get back here!   You little devil!   Nowhere to run?   You don't get it, do you?   You didn't realizeI lured you here.   You thought you were hunting me?   You're going to fry!   Magician's Red!   Hermit Purple!   Avdol can defend himselfwith his flames.   It's over for you, Joestar.   My Stand, the Goddess Bast,   is far stronger thanyour Hermit Purple!   Um... Uh...I dropped my change...   Where'd it go...   Hey... What do youthink you're doing?   I can tell you're following us.   I can see the evil in your eyes.   Huh?   Were you talking to me?   I'm not sure whatyou're talking about.   Evil? My loving parentsgave me these baby blues...   I found my change.   Oh? Then prove it!   Prove that you're not a Stand user...   Bastard!   That was close...   So you are a Stand user!   He's running?   Hey, Jotaro! It's the enemy!   I found him!    Polnareff...    Where'd you go?    Jotaro, over here!    Come back here, you!    Wait!    What the hell? He's fast!How can he be so fast?    He's already so far ahead...    Huh? My voice... Whoa!    Ow!    What's with my shoes...They're huge!    Hey, watch it.    Run around in the streetand you'll get hurt.    You're lucky I wasn't some car.    Shut up, idiot!    Lecture someone elsewith that big mouth!    Now outta my way!I'm chasing someone!    What do you thinkyou're doing? Hey!    What? It's really high up here!    He's lifting me up with one arm?    How tall is this guy?    His face and hands are huge!    Hey, you little brat!    I'll teach you not to talkto adults that way.    You think you can be a grown-upjust by wearing grown-up clothes?    Annoying, good-for-nothing brat...    You bastard...    What? What the hell?    Move it, kid! Get outta the way!    What's going on?    Everyone looks like giants!    What?    What the?    I'm a kid?    Is this really me?    I've turned into a kid!    SETALESSI    Could this really be...    Is this kid really...    Me? I'm a kid!    I turned into a kid!    Impossible! No way!    It must be his Stand!    That creep must haveput a curse on me    when his shadow Stand touched me.    This can't be happening!    sh*t, this is bad.This is really bad!    Jo...    Jo... No, Jay, Jackie, J...    What was his name?I can't remember!    But I know this guy...He can help me!    Why can't I remember?    Hey, kid. Have you seena French guy around here?    He's about yea tall, and he's gotthe same haircut as you.    That's me! It's me!    Good grief... That was a mistake.    Wait!    You're a kid now, my boy.    Both in mind and body,you could say.    Soon, you'll lose all the memoriesyou built up during adulthood.    I'm going to forget everythingI knew as an adult?    It's true...It's all becoming a blur...    Guess it's about time, huh?    I love picking on the weak!    Attaboy, Alessi!    Hold it right there!I won't let you get away, brat.    I can't really say this too loud,    but picking on the weak reallydoes it for me. Maybe too much...    I may be a littlesick up here, but...    You know what they say...    If you think you're crazy,then you're probably not.    That must mean I'm all right.    And it feels oh so good to knowI'll never lose to some kid.    Mister! Whatever your name is hel--    So you see...    my mission is to dispose of you.    Unfortunately...    I don't have time to savor the fun.    That's Silver Chariot, huh?    I suppose I should'veexpected as much;    seems you were able to summonyour Stand when you were a kid.    But...    Chariot... Even Chariot is a kid!    Pami!    And he's weak!His sword's bent from those b*ll*ts!    My Stand, Set,reverted you to childhood.    Your mental abilities reverted too.    Meaning, your Standis also a child's Stand,    back before you two werefully attuned to each other.    Now do you get it?    Seems you do. Attaboy!    Still, as weak as it is, your Standis still at your disposal.    I shall use my Standfor your execution.    Die, Polnareff!    You're mine!    Oh, no!    It snapped!    Huh?    Take that! I meant to do that!    Ow! It hurts!    Are you all right, little boy?    He's gone!    That guy runs as soon asthere's another adult around.    I'm safe for now, but what a freak!    Wait, little boy.    You're hurt! What happened?    Huh? Uh... Um, uh...    What are you mumbling?    Huh?    Those wounds need treatment.I'll fix you up at my house.    Come on.    Should I go?    I have to defeat him or else    I won't be able to transform backinto an adult!    But he won't att*ck mewith her around.    I can think of a planin the meantime!    Come on, now.    Whoa...    Oh, right.    You're hurt. Here, grab on.    She smells good...    It hurts!    Damn it!    I'm not just going to sit back andtake this from that snot-nosed kid!    He's gonna pay...I swear I'll butcher that kid!    Doesn't look likehe's coming after me.    All right, little boy.    We're going to take a bath.Let's take those clothes off.    -Huh?-You're covered in grime.    I'll clean those wounds right upand put some medicine on you.    What are you staring at?    Oh, all right.    I'll take them off for you.Here, raise your leg.    This isn't...    What's wrong?    Nothing.    No, it is something!    It is definitely something!    I don't know why,    but I feel likeI should be really embarrassed...    And...    It's so tiny!    I don't know why,but I'm really sad. Boo-hoo!    Here, hold on.    We need to get all that dirt off.    -Here, lift your leg.-Huh?    I'm so happy!    Is it really okay if I do this?    Is it okay? Of course it is.    If we don't clean those woundsthey'll get infected.    Oh, you've got dirton your wee-wee too.    I just don't know why I'm so happy!    I guess it's all part ofbeing a "kid"!    All right, be a good boy, okay?    Okay!    Look at him... he's delirious...    I'll chop his delightedlittle face in two!    What are you grinning about?    All right. Time to wash your hair.    Huh? No!    I hate shampoo!    -It gets into my eyes! I hate it!-Rock, paper...    Scissors.    Monkey...    -Monkey do...-Monkey do...    I lost!    Now, sit down.    Does it sting?    It stings a lot.    Then can you washyour hair all by yourself?    Uh-huh, I can.    Oh! Attaboy.    Yes, that's it.    Attaboy!    That's impossible!    You fell out of the window,covered in blood...    The iron bars feel too close!    This is what it meansto be utterly helpless!    I touched the shadow again!    -Lick, lick...-The lady's gone... The lady...    What do you think happened to her?
02x33 - Set's Alessi, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:46Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  What?  I'm a kid?  Pami!  Are you okay, little boy?  I'll clean those wounds right upand put some medicine on you.  That's impossible!  Chariot!  Pami!   I'm totally outmatched!   -The nice lady's gone...-Pami!   Where'd she go?   She was just here...   She didn't even scream.What did he do to her?   Where is she?   Polnareff!   You said the shampoostings your eyes, right?   Well, since you got some in there...   Let me help you wash it off!   Thoroughly!   My short arms can't reach!   If they were just a little longer,   I could poke his eyes out and run!   So you pulled the plug, huh? Damn!   But...   This way, it'll take even longerfor the water to drain.   It'd take, what,five to ten minutes   before you'd everbe able to breathe?   Give it up!   Time to snuff you out.   How does it feel to beutterly helpless, Polnareff?   What is this?   This shape...This color! It can't be...   You didn't!   No adult would even think of...   This smell... It is!   Foul! You took a sh*t in the tub!   You thought I was helpless,but I still had one in me!   Take that!   How dare you?   Have you no basic human decency?   No hero would ever resortto something so low!   You're a very bad boy! Very bad!   Where is she?   What'd you do to her?   Where is she?   Hey! Where are you? Hey!   Hey!   What do you think I did?   Whoa, there!   We should bothwatch our step, Polnareff.   You might step on her.   What?   It can't be...   No way...This can't be happening...   Oh no...   Anyone who touches my Stand, Set,   will experience time in reverse.   Polnareff, you saw me coming   and jumped out of my shadow,   earning you a few more yearsthan your little friend.   But she touched my shadowfor several seconds.   That's why she's become a fetus!   She's alive for now,   but she'll die soon enoughoutside her mother's womb!   She got what she deservedfor helping the likes of you.   What a fool.   You scum!   Crap! I just...   Uh-oh!   You touched it again!   You're going to get even younger!   This time, perhaps four years oldor so, Polnareff.   Crap!   I have to...   I have to hurry up and b*at him,or the nice lady will...   At this rate, the nice lady will diein a matter of minutes!   I've got to b*atthat freak Alessi fast!   She made me all better.She was so caring...   I have to...   I have to hurry!   Come on!   What do you think you're doing,   running aroundcradling a dying fetus?   I'll turn you into a fetus too!   Oh no! I touched it again!   I'm getting smaller...   Yahoo!   Yes! There's no way I can lose now!   Polnareff! What are you,three years old now?   Soon your intellect will be thatof a three-year-old's, too.   Locking the door won't do any good!   Dammit! The bars aretoo close together.   Even a kid   can't slip through.   Darn!   I can't cut them...   Looks like your Chariot's becomea toddler, too!   Those bars areway too tough for it now.    Chariot's a slowpoke!    Ready or not, here I come!    Lickity-lick!    It's me, Polnareff!    Hm? He's gone...    What?    He's gone! That brat...    Did he somehow slip throughthe bars in the window?    Nice try there!    Damn you, Polnareff...Trying to trick me!    You're trying tofool me into thinking    you slipped through the window.    You must be hiding somewhere,    waiting to get the drop on me.    Not bad.    Quite cunning indeed,for a miserable little sh*t!    Come out, wherever you are...    You're so small now,you could be in that drawer.    He's probably hidingin the bucket or the drawer...    No, he might be hidingin that teddy bear.    Where could he be?I've got a one-in-three chance.    I'll get him with one swing.    I'll cr*ck open his skullwith this axe!    Gotcha! You're in the teddy bear!    Or just maybe you're...    in the grandfather clock!    I guessed wrong!    Then...    Hm, think simple... The bucket!    Huh?    So you are in the bear!    The drawer, then!    Where is he?    Impossible! He's gone!    No... He couldn't have!    The walls, floor,and ceiling are all stone.    Even if they wereone centimeter thick,    Chariot couldn't break through.    And those barsare too narrow for him.    I saw it with my own eyes.    This is insane! Where is he?Where did he go?    Outsmarted by a toddler, eh?    Gulp!    Mister Alessi.    What?    One of the goldfish disappeared...    SETALESSI    I was hiding in the fish t*nkwith a mirror!    Even a kid could figure that out!    And you totally fell for it!    You're as dumb asyou are creepy, Alessi!    A two-year-old Chariotcan still skewer your face!    Bad boy!    -Hey, wait!-Pami!    I'm going to keep attacking youuntil you break your stand's spell!    Bad boy!    Very bad boy!    That little swine!He escaped out the window!    Bad boy!    Jotaro!    Crap! I'm dead meat!    It's Jotaro! What's he doing here?    It's not often you see someonefall out the window    covered in blood...    Stay calm...    The one who stays calmat times like this wins.    Think about it... Jotaro must belooking for the grown-up Polnareff.    He has no clue who I am.    I'll do what I always do.I'll play dumb...    and att*ck himwhen he least expects it!    Ah!    My boss is goingto be so mad at me!    I was cleaning the windowand slipped!    What am I going to do?    I'm going to get inso much trouble!    Hold it right there, bastard!    Ah! Mister!    What was his name?What was it... Um...    Now's my chance! I was waitingfor Polnareff to poke his head out!    I've got you, Jotaro!    Ah! Watch out for his shadow!    I did it! He touched it!I touched his shadow!    No!    Jotaro! Now you're undermy Stand, Set's, spell!    This... Wha...    This is..    Oh, no!    He's turning turn into a kid, too!    Jotaro!    I heard you developed your Stand,Star Platinum only recently.    Which means you weren't able touse your Stand when you were a kid!    Now you're just some ordinary kid!    He's so small!    He looks like a seven-year-old!    I win! Master Dio,I'm gonna k*ll Jotaro!    You'd better give mea damn good reward!    Die, Jotaro!    Whoa! He punched him!And with his little-kid fist!    Good grief.    Don't underestimate mejust 'cause I'm a kid.    Damn! Jotaro could kick asseven as a kid?    I never knew he was that tough!And as a kid...    Mumble... Huh?    You just got off easy.Let's fix that!    Attaboy!    Stand:Set, God of Chaos and Storms    Alessi:    years old, single,    and unfortunate projectile.Out of commission!    Was I dreaming?    It's that boy's earring.    So it really did happen.    For some reason, I couldn't move...    That's right! I couldn't move,but I remember everything.    He devoted himselfto protecting me...    He fought against a grown man!    He had such a braveand heroic heart.    Where did that little boy go?    Where did my little knight go?    Where are you?Where did you go?    What an amazing woman.She was so kind...    So genuine.    That was close...    I'm back to my normal self...I wonder if she's OK.    Um, excuse me...    Did you happen to seea little boy leave my house?    He has silver hair, just like you.    Pardon me for asking,but have we met before?    No... I didn't see any kid.    Let's go, Jotaro.    Come on, hurry up.    Ah... Wait!    Could you be...    That earring...    We've never met before.    There's no way we could have met.    We're travelers,    and we've nevercome this way before.    Now, if you will excuse me,    we have to get to the next town.    So it was a dream.    Keep quiet, Jotaro.    Not a single word.    Oh! Jotaro and Polnareff!    Where have you two been?    Ah, Mr. Joestar and Avdol!    I told you two not to wander offon your own.    Look who's talking!You're the ones who disappeared!    Now, now.Let's get something to eat.    Iggy! And where the hellhave you been?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    Let me clear that away for you.    Thanks.    Finally, a little relief.    That was quite the late breakfastif you ask me.    Yeah...    We're almost to Cairo.    We've got to figure outwhere Dio is hiding.    Oh, Mr. Joestar's...    Will it appear?    I'm not sure.    But we're close, so the resultsshould be more precise.    All right, here we go!    Sir, is something the matter?    We're fine. Go away.    Yes, sir...    Well, old man?Can you see anything?    Just a little longer.    I see something...    There!    We have our final destination!    You're the onewho fell for the scam.    Oh, shut up.    Gambling isjust like relationships.    The one who cries loses.    If he does anythingeven remotely strange...    You can go home if you're scared.    Let's do it! I'll wager my soul!    Good.
02x34 - D'Arby the Gambler, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:47What is that which goes onfour legs in the morning,  two at midday,and three in the evening?  So goes the riddle of the Sphinx,  the legendary guardianof the pyramids.  The answer: Man.  Those travelerswho answered incorrectly,  the tale continues, were devouredby the ravenous Sphinx.  Now   ,    kilometersfrom Japan,  Jotaro and crew havefinally reached Cairo.   Cairo is a vast country.   We must searchthe city systematically,   working our way in toward the center.   At last, we made it.   Jotaro and the othershave reached Cairo.   But before they can reach Dio,   the team must navigate the many"Sphinxes" that stand before them.   Greetings, strangers.What can I get you?   There's somethingwe want to ask you.   We're looking for this building.   Any idea where it is?   Joseph and the otherswere exhausted.   They had been searchingfor the building in the picture   since their arrival.   Taken with Joseph'spsychic photography,   the picture revealsthe current whereabouts of Dio.   Dio was now in a new hideout,   and the Speedwagon Foundationcould not locate him.   Where is Dio?   Failure to locate him soon,   will spell certain doom for Holly.   Honored stranger, this is a café.   It is customary to order drinksbefore asking questions.   We'll have four iced teas.   Never seen it.   Cairo is a city of six million.   There must be at leasttwo or three million buildings.   How are we going to find him?   We know he's here...   There has to be someonewho knows.   This building, huh?   How am I supposed to tellfrom a little picture?   Sorry, doesn't look familiar.   I see. Sorry to bother.   Humph.   Let's go. We'll inquire elsewhere.   I know where that building is.   -What?-What?   I'm rather familiar with it,actually.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE GAMBLER, PART      Was that you?Did you just say something?   I thought I heard you sayyou know where this building is.   Indeed.   I do know where that building is.   What? Really?   What news!   Yes! I can't believe we juststumbled upon someone   who knows where it is!   Where is it?Tell us! Where?   Are you expecting somethingfor nothing?   You've got a point.Sorry about that.   Here's ten pounds.   So, where is it?   I am a gambling man.   A sucker for cheap thrills.   You could even say I'm an addict.   It's how I make my living,you know.   Tell me... do you like to gamble?   I'm not sure what you're getting at.   Gambling. If you don't fancy it,just say so.   I told you I'm not surewhat you mean.   What I'm saying is, would you liketo play a little game?   If you win, I'll tell youthe location of your building.   You mean a bet?Look, I'm a lucky guy,   but we don't have timefor poker right now.   I'll give you another   pounds, so tell us.   A bet can be anything.   It won't take long.   For example,take a look over there.   See that cat?   So, two pieces of dried fish...   Which will the cat eat first?   The right one or the left one?   How about it?It's simple but oddly thrilling.   Enough games!   Just take the    pounds,and tell us, bastard!   Polnareff, that's not the wayyou ask someone for a favor.   OK, fine! I'll take the bet.   I pick the one on the right!   Good! Now it's getting fun.   Then I'll bet on the left.   Hey, now...   Hey, Jotaro. Are you thinkingwhat I'm thinking?   Yeah... He might be a Stand user.   He could also bea compulsive gambler.   If he tries anything,   att*ck with Star Platinum.   Got it.   And if I lose, what do I owe you?   A     pounds?    I don't need money.    How about your soul?Yes, your soul, will do just fine.    What?    What kind of joke is that?Cocky bastard.    I wish we couldget the hell out of here    and away from this freak.    So?    Yeah, whatever.    Ah, the cat has taken noticeof the fish.    He's heading right.    He's going for the oneon the right.    If I were a cat,I'd pick the bigger piece.    The one on the right looks bigger!    You all saw it.    He took the left, then the right,then ran.    I win.    Hey, smooth move, Polnareff.Just perfect...    Now how are we supposed toget the information out of him?    Now, then. As per our agreement,time to pay up.    Huh? Pay what?    Your soul.    That is indeedwhat you just wagered.    Your soul!    I am a Stand user who steals souls!    It's much easier to take people'ssouls when they lose a bet.    That's when my Stand swoops into take its prey!    My God! What the...    Polnareff!    Hold it! I wouldn't k*ll meif I were you. It's too late!    If I die, Polnareff will die, too!    Polnareff!    Hey!    He has no pulse.    He's dead! Polnareff is dead!    Polnareff!    This is Polnareff's soul.    Now Lord Dio has one less enemyto get in his way.    Such a fool...    I almost forgot.Allow me to introduce myself.    My name is D'Arby.    D-A-R-B-Y.There's an apostrophe after the D.    Gambler, stealer of defeated souls,    and user of the Osiris Stand.    And by the way, this is my cat.    You bastard!    How dare you! You call that a bet?You cheating, son of a...    Cheating?    Is that so? It's his own faultfor lacking the insight    to consider all possibilities.    You see, gambling is an analogy    for man's relationshipwith his fellow man.    It is a dance of deception.    The one who cries loses.    Are you going to k*ll me?    Go right ahead.    If you don't mind losingyour friend's soul, that is.    You listen to me!    Don't think you're walkingout of here alive!    Do you rememberwhat you were doing on    September   nd,     at   :   p.m.?    What are you talking about?    I remember quite clearly.    I was in California    gambling against an Americannamed Stephen Moor.    He said the same thingyou just said.    This is him.    The chip below him is his father,    and the one next to himis his wife.    If you want Polnareff's soul back,    you have no choicebut to continue    our little game.    This man is evil incarnate...    He's planning to take each of us,one by one.    So what'll it be?    You're welcome to goif you're scared...    I'll just keep Polnareff herefor safe keeping.    Here... have a drinkand think about it.    Care for a piece of chocolate?    Mr. Joestar, what are you doing?    Do you know whatsurface tension is, Barbie?    It's D'Arby.My name is D'Arby.    You mean, how the liquor appearsto almost overflow    but remains delicatelyon the brink?    What do you have in mind?    The rules are simple.    We take turns dropping coinsinto the glass.    Whoever makesthe liquor spill loses.    Hey, old man...    You can't mean... Mr. Joestar!    I'll bet my soul!     OSIRISD'ARBY ELDER    I'll bet my soul!    Good!    What?    This is insane! Don't!You know he cheats!    He can't cheat!    I decided the rules!    Jotaro, keep a close eye on himso he doesn't try anything funny.    OK! Fine, I accept.    But first...    Mind if I inspectthe glass and coins?    Of course.    You have the right tomake sure I'm playing fair.    A question.What guarantee do I have    that you will returnPolnareff's soul if you lose?    Gambler's honor.    If I lose, I assure you I will pay.But I will not lose.    Fine. You first.Go ahead and drop in a coin.    Mr. Joestar!    Leave this to me.    The old "coin and glass" trickis my specialty.    Surface tensionis surprisingly strong.    There's room for at leasteight or nine coins...    I just have to stay calm andmake sure my fingers don't shake.    May I drop in more than one coin?    Sure, as long asyou drop them in all at once.    Well, then...    Five coins?    Hey, that'll create a waveon the surface!    Quiet please!    Hands off the table.    It's your turn.    You've got nerves of steel,putting in five coins at once.    I'll go with one.    It's too close to call.    Typical...    He's squeezing a cotton ballbetween his finger and the coin,    and dripping liquid into the glass.    He's adding more liquidto the glass!    And he told me to watchfor cheating?    Clever bastard...    Not bad.    The glass has reached its limit!    One more coin andthe booze will spill! I win!    Just like he said,    it's not cheatingif you don't get caught!    That was a close one.I thought it was going to spill...    Your turn, Obi.    It's D'Arby.Don't make me say it again!    My name is D'Arby!    Not Obi, not Barbie!    Sorry.    He's screwing up his nameon purpose to piss him off.    The old man...    is a natural gambler.    Let's keep playing.    It's your turnto drop in a coin, D'Arby.    The shadow makes it difficultto see from here.    I'll drop in the coin fromthe right side of the table.    Drop it in from wherever you want.    The glass is already at its limit,thanks to my little trick.    There's no way the liquidcan take another coin.    It'll spill over with justthe slightest touch.    You're thinking the glasshas reached its limit.    That it's impossible, right?    Well, you're wrong...    Impossible! No!    Why didn't it spill!    What do you mean,why didn't it spill?    You saw for yourself,I dropped one in.    He made no suspicious moves.    I was watchingwith Star Platinum.    He dropped the coinin fair and square.    There's no doubt about it.    I was sure of it!    I was certainI added enough liquid    to make it spillwith one more coin!    I don't get it. There's no wayit couldn't have spilled!    How could this be?    Hurry up.    Or are you trying to waituntil it evaporates?    I can't believe it.    Mr. Joestar!    In his heart of hearts,Joestar realized he had lost!    That's why his soul emerged.    I, D'Arby, have won this bet!    Polnareff, forgive me.    Holly, I've let you down.    Mr. Joestar!    Old man!    Two down!    Now, then.Let's continue our game.    Unless you've decidedto abandon these two    and crawl off withyour tails between your legs.    You bastard!    You don't get it, do you?    If you k*ll me,your two friends die too.    Damn it!    Avdol, stop!    Hey! If you're going tocause trouble,    I'll have to ask you to leave!    Shut up and stay out of this!    Yes, sir!    You're too late, Jotaro.    Is something wrong withthe glass?    This is why the coin didn't makethe booze spill over.    There's a tiny bit of chocolateon the bottom of the glass.    He must have stuck it onwhen he inspected    the glass and coins atthe beginning of the game.    You know the rules.    It's not cheatingif you're never caught.    What do you mean?    How could a piece of chocolateallow him to drop in an extra coin?    It's melted now,    but it was a solid chunk atthe bottom of the glass.    Just enough toslightly tilt the glass,    but not enough for us to notice.    Once it melted,the glass became level,    making room for another coin.    What?    But...    How could he have knownthe chocolate    would melt at that exact moment?    He used the sun.    It slipped my notice.    When he moved tothe right side of the table,    he allowed the sun to shinedirectly onto the chocolate,    thereby melting it.    All right,    D'Arby,    get your cards.    We're playing poker.    Jotaro!    Very interesting!    Poker is my absolute favorite!     Poker? This is a manwho just outsmarted Mr. Joestar!     It's too dangerous!     I know, he's tough.     He may not use strength,    but he's the most dangerous Standwe've ever faced.    Well...    There's no turning back.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    -Draw three.-I'll draw two.    He's not doing anything suspicious,and yet...    Cheating is all about findinga mental blind spot.    There's only one joker.    Well, then, Jotaro...    Very well. I'll wager my soul.
02x35 - D'Arby the Gambler, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:47Before we get started,there's something I want to check.  Shuffle those cards.  They're shuffled.  What now?  Draw a card from the deck.  It doesn't matter where.  Just make sureno one else sees it.  OK.  I'll tell you which one it is:the six of hearts.   I'll name the cardsin order from the top.    Five of spades, queen of diamonds,jack of spades, ace of hearts,    seven of diamonds, six of clubs,king of clubs, two of diamonds.   He's right!   And D'Arby shuffled the deck...   How did you...   I can tell you the entire deck.   Star Platinum sawthe order of the cards   when they were shuffled.   Very interesting.   But all I have to do is shuffle the cards   where you can't see them.   Don't you get it?   It's not going to be so easyfor you anymore   to cheat with me as your opponent.   Just something I thoughtyou should know.   Good.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE GAMBLER, PART     The security seal.   An unbroken seal means the deckhas not been tampered with.   One joker.   I don't see anything unusual.   It's a normal deck.   The page number is    ...      ... No, page    .   Hasn't failed me yet.   I can tell which page it issimply by touch.   Jotaro's Star Platinum may haveincredible visual prowess,   but I can remembereverything by touch.   I know the exact locationof every card, shuffled or not.   OK! Open the game!   Ten of hearts.   Seven of clubs.   I'll be dealing then.   I need to shuffle the cards atan angle Star Platinum won't see.   Cut the deck.   And now I'll deal.   Jotaro... Me...   What? What happened?   Jotaro, his finger!   Star Platinum just brokeD'Arby's finger!   I told you.   You won't be cheating anymore.   He tried to cheat? When?He was just dealing the cards...   I didn't see him doanything suspicious.   No. Take a good look at the cardsin his left hand.   The second card is sticking out...   That's the cardhe tried to deal me.   He pretended to deal the top card,   but was about to deal methe second card from the top.   Which means...   The top card would havegone to him.   He would've had three tenswith that card.   The so-called second deal.   A sleight-of-hand technique   in which the dealer dealsthe second card in the deck,   instead of the expectedtop card deal.   Performed by an expert,the cheat is almost imperceptible.   What's more,   D'Arby knows the location ofevery card in the deck by touch.   You trash.How dare you break my finger...   I was being nice.   You're lucky I didn't rip it off.   Good grief. I guess I can't let youcut the deck anymore.   Someone else is going do itfrom now on.   That boy over there on the hilllooks like he could help.   Good.   Avdol, ask him to come here.   Certainly.   Impressive...   To cheat successfully, one mustexploit the element of surprise.   It takes more than sharp eyesto prevent that.   It appears I underestimated you,given you caught my second deal.   I'll accept my fractured fingeras punishment.   And now, I'll devote my fullconcentration to our game, Jotaro.   I haven't done so since my colossalgamble on May   th,     ...   against a Japanese manknown as Shozo Mayama.   I won his eight Tokyo properties,and his soul!   His wealth had not dulledhis gambler's instincts.   I'm not here for Lord Dio.   I'm here becauseI was born to be a gambler!   What do you think you're doing?   Those are Mr. Joestar'sand Polnareff's souls!   I've split their soulsinto six chips each.   In poker,if you think you might lose,   you can fold.   You need to be able to drop outand up the ante,   so we can't playwith just two chips.   Winning back six chips,   is the equivalentto winning one soul.    Got it?    Now, Jotaro. If we play, you'll getyour chance to win back the chips.    But I still haven'theard you say it.    Fine. I'll bet my soul.    Good!    Jotaro...    Those pure white chipsrepresent your soul.    Once I win all six,    your soul is mine.     OSIRISD'ARBY ELDER    I'll bet one chip of Polnareff's soul.    Let's begin!    In this game of poker,each player is dealt five cards.    Players have one chance to improvetheir hand by swapping out cards.    But it's the betting that makespoker a game of psychology.    Now then, I suppose I'll raise.    Keep in mind Jotaro, those sixwhite chips are your soul.    Think before you make your move.    Listen, it's okayif you don't understand.    You don't have to worry.    Just cut and deal the cardsthe way you know how.    OK...    Give me three cards.    My, my, that's quitethe frightful glare.    You must have a very good hand.    I guess I'll play it safeand bet one more Polnareff.    Call.    If you don't fold, you needat least three chips per game.    All right! Come on, Jotaro!    Two pair, eights and nines.    Oh, sorry.    Two pair, jacks and queens.    That was close.I almost lost that one.    So then...    He has only three left.    Jotaro...    OK, next game. Deal the cards.    Only the next gamemay be your last.    One card.    What's wrong, Jotaro?    Hurry up and look at your hand.    Decide whetheryou'll change or fold.    Jotaro?    No...    these cards will do.    What?    Um, pardon me...    What was that?    I think I misheard you.    I could have sworn I heard you say"these cards will do."    You heard right. These cards will do.    I'll play with this hand.    I know that!    I'm asking if you intend to    play those cardswithout looking at them.    These cards will do.    Don't mess with me! Answer me!    How can you play withoutlooking at the cards?    Avdol, I have a favor to ask.    A favor?    Of course, but why won't youlook at your cards?    Answer me, Jotaro!    I'll raise you another two and...    I'll throw in Avdol's soul.    Wh...    What?    D'Arby, you are impressive.    Sure, you're no matchfor our Stands physically,    but you're cunning andcalm under pressure.    I'm no gambler.You could read me like a book.    I would certainly loseagainst the likes of you.    But I trust Jotaro.    I don't know whyhe won't look at his cards,    but if he asks me for my soul,I won't waver.    My soul is in Jotaro's hands.    I see...    Seems you both have crackedunder the pressure.    Boy!    I said "one card"!Hurry up and deal me!    Yes, sir...    Master D'Arby,I dealt just as you asked.    His hand is worthless.I'm sure of it.    My skills as a dealer never fail.    You've won. I know it!    Jotaro thinks the boyhas nothing to do with us.    But everyone in this café    and everyone within sightof this place is my associate!    Even the bartender andthose men over there!    No matter who deals, I can't fail!    My directive is infallible.Jotaro's hand has to be a weak one.    Though, admittedly, not lookingat the cards was a bold move.    He caught me by surprise,albeit briefly...    It's a bluff!How dare he bluff against me?    Does he really think I'll fold?What a fool...    Very well.    I'll match you with six Polnareffs.    And...    I raise you Joseph's soul!    A total of fifteen chips!    What?    What? Hold on a minute!    Jotaro doesn't have any more chips!    He's out of chips, you say?Of course he does.    What do you mean?    All my Stand needsis a written contract.    Then it will be ableto take a soul.    Whose soul could yoube talking about?    Did you forget about your friendKakyoin, in the hospital?    -You can bet his soul!-What?    Panic, fool!    Show me your doubt and fear!    Let me see you losethat cool composure!    How dare he try tobluff against me?    I'll destroy him.    I'll turn that poker face intoa miserable ball of anguish!    Fine.    I'll see you with Kakyoin's soul.    Jotaro!    You can't bet a man's soulwithout his knowing!    I guess it is kind of selfish.    Hey, Jotaro! What did you just do?    What did I do?What are you talking about?    You just lit a cig...    What's wrong? Not feeling well?    This little...    Such confidence! Could he have...    Could he have used Star Platinumto swap the cards without my knowing?     I, JOTARO KUJO, AGREE TO SURRENDERTHE SOUL OF MY FRIEND NORIAKI KAKYOIN     IN THE EVENT THAT I LOSE.JOTARO KUJO    Stupid brat!    Don't look at mewith that worried grimace!    If Jotaro finds outyou work for me, I'll m*rder you!    Damn fool!    I have four kings.    The only hands that couldb*at me are four aces,    a straight flush,or a joker-led five of a kind.    To get any one of those hands,    Jotaro would haveto switch all five cards.    Sure, with Star Platinum's speed,    there's a chance he could haveswitched one of the cards.    But five? Could he have switchedall the cards right under my nose?    No! Completely impossible!    There's no way I could have missedhim replacing all five cards.    Not the great D'Arby!    All right, Jotaro!Your time's come!    He lit a cigaretteto psych me out! He's bluffing!    You got a drink? When did you...    You bastard!How dare you mock me?    Come on, let's do this!    My hand is--    Hold it.    I haven't raised the pot yet.    What?    Raise?    You don't have anything to...    I'll raise you my mother's soul.    What?    Your mother?Jotaro, you're betting Holly's soul?    I came to Egypt to save my mother.    If I lose here, she'll die anyway.She won't mind if I bet her soul!    Now D'Arby,    you better bet somethingthat matches my mother's soul.    I want you...    to tell me the secret of Dio's Stand!    He knows...    He knows Dio's secret.    But Dio does nottake lightly to treason.    If he tells us,D'Arby's as good as dead.    Jotaro... If you're that confident,    you know your hand will win,don't you?    You wouldn't let us down,would you?    You've got the winning hand,right? Jotaro?    Well? Call or fold?    Spit it out already, D'Arby!    I'll say it!    I'll say it, damn it!    I'll say it!    I'm the world's greatest gambler!    I can do this! I'll call!    Call...    I'm going to call!    Ca...    C... Ca... C...    I can't! I'm petrified!I'm speechless!    I'm too terrified...The words won't come!    C...    I can't breathe...    C... Ca...    Ca...    His eyes rolled back...    He fainted on his feet!    The pressure was just too much.    Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's soulsare returning to their bodies!    Thank God!    Inside, he had already given up.    Deep down, he knew he had lost.That's why the souls were released.    Four kings?    He had four kings!    Jotaro, what was your hand?    I knew it...    Your hand was sh*t!    Even Star Platinumwouldn't have been able to    swap cards in front ofan expert gambler like D'Arby.    Luckily my bluff and intimidation worked.    But with such a worthless hand...    Good grief. Had I known,I would've freaked.    Freaked?    Jotaro, you bet our soulson that worthless hand?    His collection of souls appearsto have been released.    Come on, everyone!Let's play mahjong!    Backgammon is a lot of fun, too.    And, oh,I love a good game of dice.    Even if you have no chance!    D'Arby, User of the Osiris Stand.Status: Retired    I doubt we'll be able to getDio's secret out of him now.    He was a formidable opponent.    He almost singlehandedlytook us all out.    He was impressive.    Yes, he was fierce.    Ugh, what just happened?    Guess we can't be the heroesevery episode.    My daughter's conditionhas worsened.    I was talking about you.    Not prepared? Don't lie to me!    Women make you do that.    You saved my life!    Mondatta and Hol Horsewill be an invincible duo!
02x36 - Hol Horse and Boingo, Part 1 / Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:48sh*t, it's so dark.I can't see a thing.  Where is that bastard?  It's broad daylight, and I still haveto feel my way around this dump.  It must've been that room.  Dio must be in there...  What the? These are Dio's leftovers?  Damn broads just throwthemselves at him.  Like they want himto drink their blood.  Nuts, if you ask me.   Guess good's got nothin' on evil.   Besides,where'd he get all this gold stuff from?   This guy can have and do anything.   Did you   want something?   Master Dio!   Damn it.   Just looking at himgives me the chills.   Keep cool, Hol Horse.   Don't let him get to you.   He's nothing.He's only slightly stronger than you...   I repeat,did you want something, Hol Horse?   Ah, uh, well...I came to inform you that,   well, it seems two ofthe Nine Great Gods,   Mariah and Alessi,have been defeated.   And?   And that's not all.   Joestar and the others willarrive in Cairo tomorrow.   Only three of the Nine Gods remain.   When I said, "And"   I was asking about you, Hol Horse.   When will you exterminate them,Hol Horse?   You swore your loyalty to me,   but you've yet toprove yourself in battle.   Anyone can relay information.   You failed me twice,and now you've crawled back to me.   My body once belonged to a man   by the name of Jonathan Joestar.   He was the grandfatherof Joseph Joestar.   Look.   Notice how the left takes longer to heal?   The left side of this body is weak.   It proves that it isn'tyet completely mine.   That I am not yet immortal.   I am ill-equippedto engage in battle with them.   Now you must destroy Joestarand the others.   On my behalf...   If not, I shall k*ll you.   You're messing with the wrong guy!   You think you canthr*aten me into doing you a favor?   Humph... on his behalf...   I'm no fool.   I just side with whoever's strongest.   That was just lip service.I'd never really swear loyalty to you.   I'm not gonna sell you my soul.   Bastard! You're not so tough!   You're wide open!   Seems you're nottoo coordinated yet...   Come to think of it,   I don't have to fight Josephand the other three...   I've got Dio all to myself.   It'd be a hell of a lot easierto blow his head to smithereens   right here, right now.   Then the treasure's mine!   This'll be a piece of cake!   He has no ideaI'm aiming Emperor   point-blank at his skull.   I can finish him off right now.   All it takes is a little pullof the trigger...   It'll be over in an instant.   Emperor was madefor close-combat carnage!   I can do this. I can do this!   What are you doing?You seem to be hesitating.   Die!   I'll splatter your brainsall over the floor, Mister Dio!   Do you really want to sh**t me?   He's gone.   There is something about you.   As you were about to pull the trigger,you did not perspire.   Your breathing was relaxed.   You were completely calm.Impressive, Hol Horse.   How did he do that?   But I didn't see him...   There's no wayhe could have stepped behind me   without breakingany of those spider webs.   No matter how fast he is.   How? How did he get behind me?   I don't understand.   Was that Dio's Stand, The World?   Ill-equipped?Ill-equipped my ass!   I finally understand, Master Dio.   I've got to pledge my allegiance.   You've got me b*at...    EPISODE   :HOL HORSE AND MONDATTA, PART     Ladies and gentlemen,   we hope you enjoyed our flightfrom Aswan today.   We will be arriving on schedule   at Cairo International Airport shortly.   Whoops! 'Scuse us.   Guess it's our cab.    Thanks.    Got a problem there, buddy?    My god...    Take me to Mena House Hotelin Giza, pronto.    I'm going to open the suitcase.    Shut your lids if you don't wantthose peepers to hurt. Got it?    Huh? Did you just say something, sir?    I wasn't talking to you.    Shut up and drive.    Yes, sir.    It's your own damn faultI had to put you on the plane like this.    Next time don't make such a fuss.    Don't be such a baby, Mondatta.    Your brother's got another month    in the hospital thanks to that b*mb.    You're my partner now.    We're gonna use your bookof premonitions and my assassin g*n    to stamp out Jotaro, Joseph,and all of them. Got it, Mondatta?    Listen. I know that you're shy.    That you're afraid of just about anyonebesides your brother, Zenyatta.    But don't you want to avenge your brother?    Do you really wanna be a coward forever,Mondatta?    I'm out of options myself!    We're gonna fight!    We're gonna get our revenge, Mondatta!    I'm going to untie you now,    but you swearyou won't wail and scream?    All right. Good boy.    Don't get too nervous,you'll get sick.    I'm on your side. Don't worry.    Relax.    Sir? Wha--Did you throw up?    Shut up!    Oh... Plane made you sick?    Let's be pals, Mondatta.    I'm Mondatta. This is Hol Horse.    He's mean. I don't like him!    While Mondatta was sleeping,    Hol Horse tied him up andstuffed him in a trunk.    Mondatta was takenfrom his brother, Zenyatta.    He was so sad!    But Mondatta wantedto avenge his brother.    Even though he was very scared,    he worked up his courageand teamed up with Hol Horse.    You won't even get near me?    Well, I guess you're trying.    I heard your Stand predicts the future.Is that really true?    Hell, it better be.    It's the whole reasonI brought you here.    Then again,if your predictions are so great,    why'd your brother get blown sky high?    Answer me!Your Stand predicts the future, right?    A new comic appearedon the blank page...    While Mondatta and Hol Horse werewalking around the outskirts of Cairo,    they met a very pretty lady.    Then Hol Horse suddenly jumpkicked the lady in the neck!    The lady was so happy,    she gave Hol Horse her jewels.    Yay! We're rich!    What in the...    You've got to be kidding me!    You call this a prediction, Mondatta?    This is crazy!There's no way this could happen!    My... My Stand...Thoth's prophecies are    never wrong!    They're    % right.    One hundred percent?Quit messing with me, kid!    Some broad is gonna give me her jewelsafter I jump-kick her in the neck?    No one would ever do that!    Listen, Mondatta.    I'm a gentleman.    I got girls all over the world.    Sure, I might tell a white lie nowand then, but I'd never hit them!    I respect all ladies.    The beauties, the dogs, all of 'em!    There's no wayyour prediction's coming true.    I swear, I won't hit a woman.    Nope, never.Even if she paid me!    It's    % true, yes.    See? The prediction was wrong!    Who the hell are you?    This is...There was a scorpion in your shawl!    -That thing's sting kills!-What?    You spotted the scorpion beforeit could crawl into my clothes.    If you hadn't k*lled it,it would've stung her for sure...    You saved my life. I must repay you.    How about my necklace?    Please take it.    We're invincible!    Mondatta and I are the unstoppable duo!    THOTHMONDATTA    So the building in the picture, huh?    I've been repairing roofs in Cairofor over    years,    and I've never seen a place like this.    From the looks of it,    thing was built abouta     years ago.    I'd guess it's somewhere    south of here.    The buildings in Cairo get olderthe farther south you go.    Huh...    Sorry I couldn't be much help.    No, thanks, sir. Sorry to bother you.    I see. OK, thank you.    I called Japan...    My daughter's much worse.    She's lost all her strength.    She has three, maybe four days.    I can feel it.    Dio is near.    He's hiding somewhere close by.    He has to be around here somewhere.    Let's go.    We'll find him.    We'll talk to everyone we can.    Yes. All we can do is keep on.    We meet again...    Man, I'm getting sick of those faces.    I never thought they'd make itso close to Master Dio's mansion...    They're almost there.    By the way...    Mondatta!    About your new prediction...Are you really sure it's right?    This is just too...There's no way this could happen!    My, my...    "My premonitions are    % accurate."That's what you're trying to say?    They are, yes.    Damn it! I'm supposed to believe this?    You've lost it, boy.    "There, we found them!"shouted Hol Horse.    "Joseph, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol!"    "Darn it!," Hol Horse fumed."They're almost to Master Dio's manor!"    "Gosh-darn bafoons.They each get a b*llet between the eyes!"    Hol Horse was full of bad thoughts.    "You're gonna pay for whatyou did to my brother!"    Mondatta was very furious.    But, Hol Horse, couldn't use his g*n,    the Emperor, in the market.    "Now, Hol Horse," Mondatta instructed,"stick your fingers up Polnareff's nose."    And then...    "We did it! They're out cold fromlosing all that blood!"    Lucky you, Hol Horse!    This is your chance to finish them off!    Like hell I'm gonna believe that!    This is the premonition?    Stick my fingers up Polnareff's nose?    What the hell is this crap, Mondatta?    I get the part about k*lling themand all, but...    I mean it, boy, don't mess with me!    Listen. Even if I am supposed tostick my fingers up Polnareff's nose,    I'd have to somehow getclose enough to him to do it!    It's much faster if I put a b*llet in himwith my Emperor. Am I wrong?    You won't be ableto fire a b*llet... yes.    Even if you try,    fate won't let you... yes.    Trust me... yes.    If you try to go againstwhat's in the comic,    you'll suffer.    It's fate... yes.It's    %... yes.    But your brother followed the comicand nearly d*ed.    My brother was tryingto save himself    and disguised himself    as Jotaro without thinking... yes.    If he had trusted what he readand not disguised himself,    then the real Jotaro wouldhave been blown up... yes.    The premonition was correct... yes.    What to do...    Polnareff's gone.    Hey, where's Polnareff?    Where'd he go?    sh*t! It can't be...    Don't move!    Or I'll lance you head to toe.    Polnareff...    Fool!And what do you think you're doing?    Keep your hands where I can see them.    I thought I saw someonestalking us like a hyena.    And sure enough,it's our old friend, Hol Horse.    Still haven't learned your lesson?Still trying to k*ll us, huh?    Thanks for the good times back in India.    You're lucky Avdol survived.    Or else you'd be dead already.    Are you by yourself, Hol Horse?    Nah, you wouldn't be here alone.    You probably have someone nearby,    don't you?    sh*t!    At least he hasn't noticed Mondatta yet.    I still have a chance...    He can see you!The book! Your fingers!    You're not much ofa thr*at on your own,    but you've got a knackfor picking allies.    If you've found another helperlike before,    you could be seriously dangerous.    So where is he?Where's your Stand-wielding partner?    Your fingers...    Hide your fingers, Mondatta.    If he finds you, it's all over!    Believe!    You got hit becauseyou tried using your g*n.    Believe in fate.    If you believe, we will win... yes.    Hey, what's under that box?Someone's in there!    Hey, Polnareff, did you findthe guy following us?    Gah! It's Avdol!He's headed this way!    Believe, yes!    Trust the book andstick your fingers    up Polnareff's nose... yes!    Are you serious? Damn it...    I've got no choice!Fine, I'll do it!    You under the crate.Show yourself!    Now's my chance!He's looking the other way!    I know you're hiding under there!    What the...    Yes!    Yay! Everyone bled a lotand passed out!    Lucky you, Hol Horse!    Now's your chance to finish them off!    So, when the hellis this chance coming?    What am I supposed to do now?     What the hell are you doing,Hol Horse?    That's what I'd like to know!    What the hell am Isupposed to do now?    Now what?    What's wrong, Polnareff?    He won't answer.    That's odd.    sh*t!They're headed this way!    Damn it!    How do I make the restof the prediction come true now?    What the hellam I supposed to do?    Damn it! I've been cornered!    It's a sign for you to look behind me!    Looks like there wasa car accident over there.    I made tea, so have some lunch.    Once I stuck my fingers up his nose,    the prediction came true.    My premonitions are absolute.It is fate, yes.

Now, Hol Horse,Mondatta instructed,  stick your fingers upPolnareff's nose, and then  We did it! They're out coldfrom losing all that blood!  Lucky you, Hol Horse!  This is your chanceto finish them off!  So, when the hellis this chance coming?   What am I supposed to do now?    What the hell are you doing, Hol Horse?   That's what I'd like to know!   What's wrong, Polnareff?   sh*t! They're headed this way!   Damn it!   How do I make the rest ofthe prediction come true now?   Polnareff, did you find outwho was tailing us?   Answer me.   Avdol and the others are coming.   This is bad, really bad!   Chariot!   Whoa, hold it right there!   This is bad!   I'm the fastest sh**tyou'll ever meet.   Don't move or you're a dead man!   Hey, Polnareff, was that you?   Polnareff!   Oh, there you are.   What's the matter?   Was someone following us?   Er...   Damn it! I'm cornered.   I thought I was supposedto get my big chance   after I stuck my fingers upPolnareff's nose!   I'm in a whole lotta trouble!    Something wrong, Polnareff?    No.   If Avdol finds out I'm here,I'm a goner!   I think I'm gonna cry.   If I knew this was going to happen,   I would've just blown him awayfrom a distance!   Dammit, Mondatta!   I was faster than Polnareff, but...   Crap!   Polnareff?   Tell them to scram!   If they catch me,you're going down with me, Polnareff.   No one was following us.   Guess it was just my imagination.   I see.   And what are you doingstanding there like that?   Tell them you were taking a leak.You were pissing!   Oh, you know just taking a wizz.   What?   You were peeingin the middle of the street?   You amaze me sometimes.   Stop jabbing that g*n into my head!   That's it!I'll make a little gesture.   God I hope they figure it out.   Look where my tongue is pointing!   I'm trying to give you a sign!Behind me!   Behind me, damn it! Behind me!   Why are they being so quiet?   Ah, well. You guys go on ahead.   All right.   I was lying!   It was a lie! Don't leave me!   Look at my tongue. Behind me!   Behind me, damn it!Come on, just look!   What's wrong?   Why are you making that face?   Does your tongue hurt?   No, he's signalingsomething's behind.   You idiot! Shut up!   You don't mean...   Polnareff!   You son of a...   You were signalingsomething to them!   That's it! You've pissed me offfor the last time!   Die!   What?   -Huh?-It's him!   What the hell? He sneezed?   It's Hol Horse! Watch out!   He's got a friend hidingunder the crate!   Blast it! This can't be happening.   He sneezed because I jammedmy fingers up his nose!   Damn! If he hadn't sneezed,   I could've at leastgotten Polnareff.   I should've neverteamed up with you, Mondatta!   They're gonna k*ll me!   It's all because ofthat blasted premonition!   I'm doomed!   Brother, look! Look who's there!   That's him, all right.   It's the bastardwho blew off my ear at the airport.   I'll run him over!   What?   This is...    It all happened so fast.    They had no time to stopthe truck with their Stands    I stuck my fingers up his nose,and the prediction came true.    I can't believe it.All four of them at once!    It's fate, yes.    My premonitions are always right.    But it's too soon to finish them.    We must wait forthe next prediction, yes.    Okay!    EMPERORHOL HORSE    “We did it!”, they proclaimed.    The chance to finish offtheir enemies had arrived!    But be careful, you two.    Don't rush in. Hide and wait.    It's still too soon to move in.    Three of them are knocked out,but Jotaro's still conscious.    He's about to get up!    Jotaro wasn't hit directly.    That was a close one.    If we had crept up to him,he could've att*cked us.    He's looking for me.    He's wondering why I split    instead of blowinghis head straight off.    We're gonna b*at 'em right,Mondatta?    We've made it this far.I have to win whatever it takes.    You're with me right, Mondatta?    Yeah.    We're almost there.    So Mondatta, what do we gotta do nextto k*ll these guys?    Your comic's predictionsare    % accurate.    I believe you!    I'll do whatever I have to.    If it tells me to stick my fingersup something, I'll do it.    If it tells me to eat crap,I'll eat it.    I have to win!    There... it is!    It finally appeared, yes.    -The final prediction!-What?    Here we go! Hol Horse'snext att*ck will be his last!    Hol Horse came acrosstwo plumbers repairing drainpipes.    Then he paid themto open one of the pipes.    If Hol Horse firesall of his b*ll*ts into that pipe    at exactly twelve noon...    Hey, looks like there wasa car accident around the corner.    Who cares? Let's finish this thing.    Here, hold this pipe.    Okay.    What happensif I fire into the pipe?    Come on! Turn the page!    I fire my g*n into the pipeand then what?    And the b*ll*ts flew outthe other end!    Ka-boom! Hol Horse's b*ll*tswent right through Jotaro's skull!    Right smack in the middleof his forehead!    Yes!    This is it, yes!    I've been waiting for this, yes.    This is whatI've been waiting for, yes.    That's great!    I mean, it looks great,but hold on a sec!    What if we read it wrong?Then we're toast!    Look at this page.    This is the predictionfrom when your brother    tried to wipe out Jotaro.    But your brother was the onewho got blown up!    That's because my brothertransformed himself into Jotaro    without thinking, yes.    But you and I cannottransform ourselves, yes.    That's right!I don't have any disguise powers!    I couldn't even pretendto be Jotaro.    Does that mean...    It does! Yes.    I can avenge my brother! Yes!    There's no way to misinterpretthis prophecy, yes.    If you sh**t your b*ll*tsinto this pipe,    Jotaro will die!    Yes!    But wait.    It said a time.    At the stroke of noon, wasn't it?    Wait, twelve o'clock sharp?    We have two minutes!    Don't panic.    All you have to do is aim your g*ninto the pipe and fire, yes.    You have plenty of time, yes.    It's fate.It will happen.    I know. It's    %!    I believe you. I believe you, but...    I'm under the g*n.    I gotta hustle!    Hey, you guys! Listen up.    Open that pipe!    Just do it!    Hey, who do you thinkyou're talking to?    Who the hell do you think you are?    You wanna die!Hurry the hell up and open it!    Hol Horse, ordinary peoplecannot see your Stand, yes.    The comic saysyou pay them, yes.    Huh? Pay them?    Now only one minuteten seconds left!    Okay, I'll pay you!    All right! I'm sorry!I'll pay you to open it!    Please! Just open it!    Pay us? What a weirdo.    You'll pay usjust to open the pipe?    Then sure. Hand it over!    Right.    Hey, what's the problem?    I don't have any money!    That's right!I left my wallet at the hotel.    Who is this guy?    Mondatta!    Remember, if you got lost?I gave you some change just in case.    Give it to me. Hurry!    Yes.    We've got    seconds. Faster!    Here's your change purse.There's a lot of money.    Hey, one rolled behind the bricks.    It's just coins,but there's a lot of them.    How much you think there is?    Looks like maybe    pounds!Hey, you're stepping on one.    -Oh, you're right.-Pick the damn coins up later!    You can have it all!    Here you go, boys.It's almost noon.    I made you some tea.    Take a load offand have some lunch.    Oh, sounds good to me.    Listen, granny! I was here first!Now scram!    Thanks, ma'am.    You sons of!I said hurry up and open it!    Or I'll cr*ck your heads openwith this rock!    Okay, it's open.    Out of the way!    Die, Jotaro!    I did it!Just like the prediction said!    I sh*t 'em at the stroke of noon!    Go get him!    Wake up, old man.    I think I'll be okay.    Me too.Just minor cuts and bruises.    But Polnareff is...    Someone get this damn blockoff of me.    I won!    He's right in front of the pipe!    What?    Hey, hey.    Sorry, Jotaro.    I don't knowwhat Hol Horse was thinking,    but he stuck his fingersright up my nose.    The guy's disgusting.    It still itches. Sorry.    My b*ll*ts!    They missed!    Mondatta!What are you trying to pull?    What the hell is going on?    I don't know, yes.    My predictions are always true!It's fate!    I can't believe it!    My predictions have neverever been wrong, yes!    Look! Jotaro and the othersare still alive.    Not one b*llet hit any of them!    The prediction was totally wrong!    You little...    Tune in next time.    Now for the twelve o'clock news...    Huh?    What? It's noon now?    My watch!    It's fast!    That means I firedthe b*ll*ts too soon.    It's exactly noon!    What's gonna happen?    What's gonna happen now?    It can't be...    The prediction said the b*ll*ts would goright through Jotaro's forehead    at the stroke of noon.    Hol Horse, the b*ll*ts are...    What's gonna happen next?    Hey, did you hear that?I thought I heard someone scream.    I don't know what's going on,but something's fishy.    This truck.    Let's get out of herebefore the cops show up.    What the hell happenedto Hol Horse, anyway?    I don't know.    He disappeared for some reason.    Careful, Jotaro. Get awayfrom that pipe before you get soaked.    Is he dead?    No, but he's critical.    I have no idea what happened,    but looks like a b*lletwent through his forehead    and out the top of his head.    One centimeter lower,and he would have been a goner.    He's a very lucky man.    My prediction was correct.    And this was Hol Horse's fate.    But that Jotaro,    how lucky can he be?    Both my brother and Hol Horselost to fate.    Master Dio is the only onewho can defeat him.    Zenyatta,    Hol Horse taught methat revenge is just a big joke.    I'm going to forget about Jotaro.    From now on, I'm going to usemy prophetic powers    for our happinessand for the happiness of others.    Maybe people will start to like us.    Maybe our futurewill be a little brighter.    I'm sick of spending my lifecowering under a box,    afraid of everyone.    I learned a lot from this battle.    I'm coming home, Brother.    I'm coming home to Aswan,to join you.    Sorry.I kicked it without thinking.    I didn't mean to hit you.    Forgive me.    Wait, this dog...    I think I've seen him before,but where?    This dog!It couldn't be!    No!    Hey, by the way,where'd that dumbass dog go?    Iggy?    I'm sure he's scroungingfor food somewhere.    I told youthat he wouldn't help us.    If people could change that easily,life wouldn't be so hard.    Sure enough, Mondatta joinedHol Horse in the hospital,    meeker than ever.    Ba-dum-tss!    Iggy hates being with others.    I was looking for youbecause I have a request.    No doubt about it.It's this mansion.    By the way, where'd Iggy go?    Good grief. I can't let a kidwho likes dogs die.
02x38 - The Guardian of Hell, Pet Shop, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:49Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  So the buildingin the picture, huh?  I've been repairing roofs in Cairofor over    years,  and I've never seena place like this.  My daughter's much worse.  She has three, maybe four days.  I can feel it.  Dio is near.  Let's go.   We'll find him.We'll talk to everyone we can.   Man, it's scorching out here today.   I haven't had a showerin nearly two days.   It's ruiningmy gorgeous good looks.   What's the matter, jerk? You havesome kind of problem with me?   Not too bright there, eh?   I'm telling you to move!   What's a foreigner like you doingsitting here like some beggar?   Who told you to sit here?   Ah, you're a beggarfrom a foreign land.   It isn't much, but...   Hey, this is...   You bastard! How dare you?   This is supposed to bemy turf, damn it!   Your turf?   Polnareff!   Don't sit there.   Give that money to him.   So he's a beggar?   Excuse my friend.   He's not accustomedto the rules of this town.   Well, why didn't you just tell meyou're a beggar?   Cause that's my shtick!I'm a mute beggar!   There's a beggars'association here.   Beggars have their own areaswhere they are paid to sit and beg.   It may seem strange,   but their own rules helpkeep everything in order.   Huh!   Tsk! You bruised my ego!   I wonder if I'll make more money   if I just disguise myselfas a foreign beggar.   Well, there's always tomorrow.   By the way,I thought you looked familiar.   You're Avdol, the fortune teller.   I heard you fled to Japan'cause someone was trying to k*ll you.   Actually,I've been looking for you.   You know everything there isto know about this area,   so I wanted to ask you a favor.   You'll be well rewarded.   We need to find this building.   And we're short on time.   Well, that's enough workfor one day.   I'll find that mansion in three hours.Wait right there.   By the way, did anyone see Iggy?    EPISODE   : THE GUARDIAN OF HELL,PET SHOP, PART     It's a definite match.   That's the place.   And just in two hours.   There's nothingI can't find in this city.   Huh?   Meanwhile,Iggy thought to himself...   That bird is a Stand userjust like me.   It made that giant piece of iceand k*lled 'em.   He's protecting that place.   It kills anyonewho gets close to the mansion.   And that bird's...   gonna come after me next!   From very early in their history,   the ancient Egyptians recognizedthe prowess of the noble falcon   soaring high above the Nile valley.   They trained the birdas their hunting partner,   and considered ita representation of Horus,   guardian deity of the royal family.   Capable of spotting preyseveral kilometers away,   the falcon's eye is symbolizedby the Eye of Horus,   an emblem of protectionand royal power.   This is Pet Shop,   wielder of the Stand Horus,god of the sky.   Iggy wondered.   Looks like I just stumbled onDio's mansion,   that place Jotaro was looking for.   And it used its Stand to make   that giant hunk of ice.   It's a guard dog,I mean a guard bird.   You've got to be kidding me!   I couldn't care lessabout this Dio guy.   I was dragged here,   forced to be some allyto the Joestars!   Like hell I'm gonnafight this thing!   All I want is a little r-and-r,a girl of my own,   and some place to settle down.I don't wanna hurt anybody!   'Sides, if I fight this freakn bird,what's in it for me?   I'm not putting my lifeon the line here!   Time to playthe old "dumb dog" routine.   He'll never guess I haveanything to do with those guys!   Those eyes...   You can never tellwhat a bird's thinking.   I bet my Stand could b*at him.   Then again, there's a real good reasonI'm making a fool of myself.   I've got nothing to do with Jotaroand those other guys!    Go back to your mansion,you damn bird!    That bird.    What's with that bird?It's not moving!    It's too late!    I'm gonna run it over!    What was that bird?    It flew under this car?It's so low!    It didn't even tryto get out of the way.    It dove right under.    Crazy bastard!    Looks like he's lostinterest in me, for now.    Seems he att*cksonly when someone tries to get inside.    Even so,if Jotaro finds this place,    he'll have a hell of a time.    Well, that's their problem.    Tiny! Buch!    Where are you guys?    Hey, have you seen my two dogs?    They're Tiny and Buch.    Shut up! Don't ask me! I'm a dog.    I can't talk.What are you stupid?    That collar!    That's Tiny's collar!    Why's his collar under the gate?    And there's blood on it!    Tiny and Buch?    Is he talking about those big dogs?    Tiny! Buch!    Hey, he better not...    He better not be thinkingabout getting under that gate?    It'll m*rder him!    Tiny! Buch! Are you there?    This isn't my problem.    I don't really careif some human kid dies.    Survival of the fittest,as they say.    The stupid die.    And so do peoplewho don't think before they act.    I don't want any trouble.    So long, kid!    Tiny! Buch! Where are you?    Come back!    It's eating my precious dogs! No!    Good grief.    I do sorta have a soft spot    for kid dog lovers!     HORUSPET SHOP    Tiny! Buch!    Damn it! Guess...    I'll have to take care of this.    The moment had finally come.    Pet Shop was onto Iggy's Stand abilities.    Bring it on, bird!I'll slaughter you!    A falcon can dive at speedsof over     kilometers per hour,    making it the fastest animalon the planet.    It rips out its prey's vital organswith razor-sharp talons,    and can preciselytarget its victims,    even at its trademark speed.    What the?Did he just smirk at me?    I thought I just saw the cornersof his beak creep up.    Birds can smile?    What the?    Something's majorly wrong.    The air, it's suddenly frigid.    Ice is coming out of the ground!    Crap!    I was too busy looking up.My feet are stuck!    My Stand's feet are stuck too!    Crap!    Icicles?    Come on, Avdol.    Do you really think that guycan find Dio's mansion?    If not, no one can.    No one knows Cairo's complex mazeof streets better than he does.    Be patient. Have faith.    You say that,    but we looked for three days,with no luck.    I don't see how finding it inthree hours is remotely possible.    You're becoming tedious, Polnareff.    Could you try to gainsome composure?    Look we're all on edge.    All we can do nowis talk to the locals.    Jeez. To top it all off,Iggy's nowhere to be seen.    Where the hell didthat stupid mutt run off to?    Iggy's a loner by nature.    I'm sure he's close by.He'll show up eventually.    Aren't dogs supposed to light upand wag their tails with glee    when they see humans?    And here we are stuckwith the little cynic.    I managed to get away.    That thing's ice took the skinright off my paws.    Damn it!    I knew I should've letthat human kid fix his own problems.    That bird's Stand is no joke.    That was no ordinary ice.    He's not showing all his cards.    I better get the hell out of here.    Talk about holding a grudge!    Iggy disappeared.    Where did he go?    Damn it!    That bastard doesn't hold back.    He's only a bird.    This place reeks,but it'll have to do for now.    I have to keep quiet and hide outdown here until he gives up.    What's up with this bird?    Hey.    Don't underestimate me.    What, you think you just k*lled    is actually my shapeshifting Stand,the Fool!    Gotcha! Bird brain!    Looks like you're losinga lot of blood there.    You might wanna keep still.    I don't give a rat's assabout you or your master Dio.    Let's just call this a draw.    You got a few good hits on mewith those ice missiles,    so we're even, okay?    What the hell?    Does he think he's Bruce Leeor something?    Hey! I said I'll stay awayfrom your boss's mansion!    Let's stop this already. Okay?    So that's whatyour Stand looks like?    You stopped the bleedingby freezing it?    Crap!    He blocked the exit with icewhen I wasn't looking!    The ice is coming this way!    sh*t!    It's starting to cover the tunnel!    I've got to get out of here!    It blocked this exit, too!    He's locked onto me!    He's insane!    He's not relentless!    He's a hunting machine!    And if he catches me,he won't just k*ll me.    He'll eat me alive!    What? My foot!    I can't get my foot out!    -Man, this is really not my day!-That stupid dog.    That birdbrain is reallypissing me off.    It wouldn't be strangeif there was a Stand user    in charge of guarding the mansion.    I'm gonna have to do this!    If I don'the's going to k*ll me!

EPISODE   : THE GUARDIAN OF HELL,PET SHOP, PART      Hey, the sun's about to set.   Three hours, my ass.   Guess that cocky beggar   never did find Dio's mansionlike he said he would.   Eh, Avdol?   I just had a disturbing thought:   I'm beginning to hopehe hasn't found the mansion.   It's very possiblehe hasn't returned   because he did find it.   Hey!   I have a sinking feelingthat a Stand user is guarding Dio's lair.   We may have put that beggar's lifein grave danger.   Ah, come on!   My leg...   The ice caught my pawlike a bear trap.   I would've been dead meatif I hadn't gnawed it off.   I'll hide here for a while.   I have to hideand get him off my tail!   The Speedwagon Foundationcan make me an artificial leg.   Now I'm pissed!Damn bird!   You're not getting away with this!   I'm gonna make you pay!Just you wait!   That sound!   Something just dove into the water!   No, it can't be!   Birds are capableof plunging into water.   Like any human or canine,a bird has lungs to breathe.   But the average bird also hassome five to six air sacs   in its chest and stomach.   The air sacs allow a bird   to fly and remain consciouswhere a human could not   at altitudesof six to seven thousand meters.   Even when strangled,   a bird can survivefor several minutes   thanks to its internal air reserves.   Which means a bird can stayunderwater much longer than a dog!   Something's diving this way!   That's impossible!   I can't believe it.   It's heading right for me!   Is it? It can't be!   It's that bird!   How can a bird survive underwater!   That bastard, where'd he go?   He's closing in!He's going to att*ck again!   More icicles. One, two, three.   Three are coming this way!   Right back at ya!   I did it. How do you like that?   The wall isn't leaking anymore.   The icicle's baseis freezing the wall!   What now?   I know what he's up to.   He's freezing the water   all around me!   And he severed my air pipes!   He's not trying to suffocate me.   He's trying to bury me alive!   It's no use.It's gonna collapse!   It's too powerful!I can't hold him off!   I'm surrounded by iceand freezing water!   Damn it!   So much for a decent hiding place!   I'm just going to haveto dig my way out.   Man, today is really not my day!   I lose my leg,   and some psychotic demon bird wantsme flattened and flash frozen!   I can't hold him off anymore.I'm going to be crushed.   I need to dig myself out, pronto!   Huh?   What's that? Some kind of cave?   It's the bird!   He's gonna sh**t an ice m*ssile!   Crap! My Stand is behind me!   There's no way I can defend myself.   Nowhere to escape!   That's it!There's no other way.   It's do or die!   I'll let the dome break   on purpose!   The air pressure will catapult me!   I did it. I finished him off.   Damn bird got what he deserved.   But I'm done for.   I've lost a ton of blood.   I don't have the strengthto swim to shore.   I'm gonna drown.   I was supposed to livea trouble-free life.   Damn it,    I goofed up.    I can't believe it!    I was passing by and saw youstruggling in the river.    That bird got you, didn't it?Just like he got my dogs.    You'll be okay.    The bird is gone.    You can't die! Hang in there!    I'll patch you right up.    "That bird": Pet Shop.    Stand: Horus.Status: Deceased.     HORUSPET SHOP    Damn that Iggy!Where the hell did he go?    He's gotta stop doing this!    I'm worried.He's been gone a while.    That stupid mutt!    What's the matter, Jotaro?    So someone is following us.    No I thought I heard a voice.Like someone calling us.    A voice?    Iggy?    Iggy!    What happened to you?    He's got injuries all over!    Hey! He's missing his front leg!    Did he get run over by a car?    He's not the kind of dogthat gets into car accidents.    You were att*cked,weren't you, Iggy?    Looks like someonetreated his wounds.    They did an incredible job.    It wasn't Iggy that I heard.    It was definitely a human.    It appears Iggy had a run-inwith the enemy.    We saw a boy holding him.He was half-dead.    The doctors from the SpeedwagonFoundation tended to his wounds.    Just like...    my eyes.    You're...    Kakyoin!    It's Kakyoin! Hey!    Kakyoin, how are your eyes?    I'm glad you're all safe.    We missed you!    Were they able to treat you?    Yes. I'm fine now.    I've got a few scars,but my eyesight is back to normal.    Thank goodness.    Jotaro.    Hey, Iggy.Where are you going now?    He may've been indifferenttoward humans and Stands before,    but it looks like he's tryingto lead us somewhere.    I don't know what happenedbetween him and the enemy Stand,    but now,I'd say it's a matter of revenge.    Just where is he taking us?    Hey, Iggy, hold on.    That car!    It's the same fancy carthat beggar was driving.    This wreckage is...    What did this?    There's a huge hole,    like some gigantic pillartore through the windshield.    It's just as I feared.    I knewwe shouldn't have asked him.    Could this be the workof the Stand user    that Iggy possibly encountered?    There seems to be little doubt.    Iggy!    Hey, what is this?    I'm in a cold sweatall of a sudden.    I feel this oppressive doom.    Where's Iggy trying to take us?    I know this feeling.    This aura of evil.    This mansion.    The one from the picture.    Iggy! You were able to find it!    What lay before them was somethingmore evil and more sinister    than anything Jotaro and the othershad encountered before.    Finally,the source of their predicament,    the very embodiment of evil,their destiny, was within grasp.    The path that had led themhere was long.    Mysterious foreign lands    and treacherous Stand-usingassassins met them at every step.    Every battle wasa struggle for survival.    And the journey touched everyone.    There were tears, and there waslaughter, sadness, and rage.    There was joy.    Nearly    days has passedsince the team left Japan    on their quest to saveJotaro's mother, Holly.    All to defeat Dio.All to end the hundred-year curse.    Joseph was determined.    He was going to savehis daughter, Holly.    And nothing was goingto get in his way.    Kakyoin remained resolute.    He would defeat Dio,    not only to save Holly,but to overcome his own weaknesses.    Avdol was steadfast.    He considered it his dutyto locate and root out evil    wherever it lurked,wherever it thrived.    Polnareff was unwavering.    He would make Dio pay.    Pay for turning him intoone of Dio's puppets.    And pay for making himgo against his own principles.    Iggy was furious.    He knew Dio, the bastard,    was why he was caught upin all this absurdity.    And he was goingto make him pay.    And...    So, in other words, if we b*atthe sh*t out of Dio in there,    it will all be over.    He's here. This scent of evil,there's no doubt    he's inside the mansion!    Which means that we...    ...have finally reachedthe end of our journey.    Are you ready?    The gate's open.    We can just walk in?    It was closed yesterday.    Just as I can sense him,he can sense us.    Entering this mansionwould be like walking into a trap.    Now...    What do we do now?    The door is opening! Stay on guard!    Hey, look at this corridor.It looks like it goes on forever.    It can't be real.    It must be some kind oftrick or illusion    Polnareff,don't go through that door.    Dio's probably got one or twoStand users left to fight us.    What the?Something's coming this way!    What is he? Is he a Stand user?    Welcome.    Master Joestar,we've been expecting you.    I am the butler of this house.    Allow me to wager    that Star Platinum's first att*ckagainst me will...    Jotaro, blast him!    Take that corner at full throttle!    If we don't defeat you,we won't be able to proceed.    Exactly! That is indeed correct.
02x40 - D'Arby the Player, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:56What the?Something's coming this way!  I don't know who you are,but you're no ordinary human!  Polnareff!  And I'm gonna end you!  A playing card?  Welcome. Master Joestar,we've been expecting you.  I am the butler of this house.  My name is D'Arby.  D'Arby?   Yes. My name is D'Arby Younger.   The D'Arby whom you defeated,   is my older brother.   You're D'Arby the gambler'syounger brother?   So you're hereto avenge your brother?   No, certainly not.I would do nothing of the sort.   Did my brother not sharewith you his motto?   "The deceived, not the deceiver,holds the blame."   It is an adageI hold dear, as well.   My brother lost.He is the wrongdoer.   I hold no grudge against you.   My brother is my brother.And I am me.   We are two different people.   My brother and Iare ten years apart.   I did look up to himto a certain extent,   but we are of different generations.   My brother tried to winby deception.   He is old-fashioned.   He could win against onlythe outmoded and the inexperienced.   Master Dio realized that as well,   which is why he kept me by his sideand made me his butler.   Is something wrong?   If you wish to fight me,   then I invite youto enter our manor.   Stay on guard, everyone!   We don't have time for games.Take us to Dio!   Jotaro! Be careful!Something's coming out of his body!   D'Arby Younger. His Stand, Atum.Atum of the Egyptian pantheon.   Hey, he brought out his Stand!   We haven't seen this in a while.   So another Standthat actually shows itself.   So who's first?   Who shall be my first opponent?   Forget that!   Jotaro, take him down!   I'll bet youStar Platinum will first att*ck   with his left arm.   His first att*ck will be a punchthrown with his left arm.   -How much do you bet?-This is bullshit!   It won't makea difference either way.   One punch is all it takes!   Do it!   Hit him, Jotaro!   What? He dodged it?   Such amazing speed!   That's impossible.   Ah, too bad.It seems I lost the bet.   Like my brother,I enjoy a good bet.   But, alas,luck is never on my side.   To apologize, I shall take youto a wonderful world.   What the? A pit?   Blast it! It was all a trap!   Jotaro!   Jotaro's falling into the abyss!   Pull him out!   I suppose I have no choice.Join us.   Mister Joestar! Kakyoin!   Wait! It's too dangerousto go in after them!   Avdol, can you hear me?   If you don't hear from usin ten minutes,   torch that mansion!   Understand, Avdol?   Mister Joestar!    EPISODE   :DARBY THE PLAYER, PART     Is this an illusion?Are we underground or above ground?   This water feels so real.   What is this?   Just what is he trying to do?   Old man, Kakyoin,see if you can figure this out.   His Stand knew without a doubtI would throw a right punch.   Have any idea why?   If we don't figure it out,we'll lose this one.   Care to wet your whistle?   The drinks are real.   And I assure youthey are not poisoned.   Are we inside the mansion?   Yes.   Where in the mansion are we?   I cannot tell you that.   -Are we in the basement?-Perhaps.   Is a Stand doing this?The illusion?   Yes.   Is it your Stand?   No.   -Is it Dio's?-No.   Whose is it?   I'd rather not say.   The Speedwagon Foundationhas reported   that there are two to three moreStand users.   Is that true?    I'd rather not say.    You're not being very helpful.    I could lie,    but unlike my brother,I prefer not to resort to trickery.    So what you're saying is    if we don't defeat you,we can't proceed?    Exactly!    Absolutely correct, my good sir.    That gentlemanly demeanoris beginning to get on my nerves.    Remember, it's three against one.    We're short on time,    so you'll have to deal withall three of us at once.    Come now, take a load off.    I have something to show you.    This is my collection.    Collection?    Like my brother,I'm a humble collector.    Every collector yearns to sharehis treasured trinkets    for that ephemeral momentof praise, does he not?    Is he a...    Dolls? But why?    No, Kakyoin.    He's D'Arby's brother.    Those aren't ordinary dolls.    D'Arby!    Talk to me. Please, talk to me.    Talk to me!    I'm so lonely!    Help me!    Oh my God!    They're alive!These dolls are alive!    You bastard! You took their souls!    My hobby is making dolls.    Course,    most doll makers cannot imbuetheir handiwork with human souls.    I suppose I may begiving too much away,    but that is my Stand's ability.    My brother's collectionis rather boring.    All he has are simple coinsmade of souls.    With my collection,you can play dress up    and have actual conversations.    -Meet Sonia.-D'Arby!    She can wax poeticabout her many passionate love stories.    She has such exquisite skin,doesn't she?    Anyone would be proud to own her.    Dr. Elliott is a serial k*ller.He's k*lled eight people.    He'll tell you all aboutthe patients he's exterminated.    I made the glassesand stethoscope myself.    Oh, and how could I forget!I must show you this!    This is Tatsuhiko,a video game expert from Japan!    He was a formidable opponentwith an IQ of    .    It wasn't easy b*ating himand stealing his soul, though.    You're just as sickas your brother.    No, you're even more sadistic.    I'm losing all patience!    Beneath that polite façadeis a deranged sociopath.    You make me sick.    By the way,I'm sure you learned this    when you fought my brother,    but the human soulis a mysterious thing indeed.    The moment a person admits defeat,    the soul losesalmost all its vitality.    At that very moment,I can rip out a person's soul!    That is our Stands'fundamental mechanism.    I've heard enough!No more Mr. Nice Guy!    We'll knock the living daylightsout of you,    and get the hell on our way!    But you must listen!    Jotaro! You already knowyou're under my control.    Remember, Jotaro,when you tried to att*ck me,    and I knew exactly which armyou would use.    Shocking, wasn't it?    You still haven't figured it out!    You were shaken,and while only slightly,    I was able to touch your soul.    What do you think I didwhen I touched your soul?    What?    What is that?    I embedded Atum's handinside your soul.    I could crush your right armand make Master Dio very happy.    But if I did that,    I wouldn't be able to defend myselfagainst Kakyoin and Joseph,    and I would perish.    I certainly don't want that.    So I have a suggestion, gentlemen.    Let's play a gameand bet our souls.    What?    If you b*at me,I will let go of your arm.    Good grief.Already under your control, huh?    You're going to regret this, D'Arby.    I would love to hear youutter the words,    "I'll bet my soul on this game."    And I have another humble request    Kakyoin, you shall bemy first opponent.    Hey, what do you mean?    You should fight me first.    Mr. Joestar and you are family,but Kakyoin is not.    I'd prefer Kakyoin not back outand att*ck me with his Stand    after I've taken both your souls.    Damn, arrogant prick.    assh*le thinks he's won already.    Fine. I'll be your opponent.    -What?-Kakyoin!    It's fine. I'm not worried.    I've probably played morevideo games than anyone here.    I challenge you to F-Mega.    I'll bet my soul!    Good.    Kakyoin!    You don't have to go first.    Yes, I do.    The hand in your arm could hinderyour game-playing ability.    D'Arby,    how do I knowyou'll release Jotaro if you lose?    The TV, console,and game cartridges are all good.    It's an ordinary video game setup.    I am not like my brother.I do not cheat.    Now, let's begin.    Yes.    Go ahead, and select your vehicle.    Right.    So, I see you picked #  .    I will be #  .My birthday is January  th.    We can begin whenever you please.    Cut the courtesy and start!    Race start in...    Five!    He's button mashing the acceleratorat such an incredible speed    He's trying for a turbo start!    Three!    -Damn! I don't have time...-Two!    ...to do the same!    He'll take the lead!    One.    Start!    He blocked me!    As long as I'm in fronthe can't b*at me.    It's impossible for him to pass.    And unfortunately for you,    I never make mistakesduring a race.    It's over, Kakyoin!    What?    Kakyoin, you've playedthis game before, haven't you.    I'd rather not say.    All right!This is your chance, Kakyoin!    Hurry up! Get your machineback on course and start!    That technique...    You don't get these skillssimply by playing video games.    I never guessedhe'd make such a bold move.    They're tied! They're side by side!    No. Kakyoin is on the outside.    He's at a disadvantageon the turns.        kilometers per hour,    ,    .    Three seconds till the first turn!    I can't turn at this speed!    I'm entering the turnat full speed!    Two! One!    They're synchronized!    They turned at the same speedat the same time!    They're neck and neck!    I like you, Kakyoin!    Your soul is on the line,but you're unflinching!    You've conquered your fear!    You will make a worthy additionto my collection.    Noriaki Kakyoin thought to himself...    Conquered my fears?    Thank you.I haven't always been this way.    Six months ago,when I met your master, Dio,    he planted a flesh bud in my brain,    and I was terrified.    I still remember.    I remember the horrorof facing that monster.    My legs wouldn't move.Every hair on my body stood on end.    I was frozen.    I realized I was helpless.    The mere sight of him was turningmy own body against itself.    My stomach was in knots.    I could taste bilein the back of my throat.    I nearly threw up.    Dio gazed down at me,    and said tenderly,as if calming a child...    Kakyoin.    There's nothing to fear.    Let's be friends.    I curse myself! I heard his words.    And I was relieved.    Totally and utterly relieved.    "I can still live!", I thought.    But it was humiliating.I'll never forgive him!    It was humiliating beyond words.    I'll never forgive myself.    I curse myselffor submitting to him.    Jotaro saved me.    That's why I decidedto embark on this journey.    I will never againallow myself to become    the pathetic, cowardly KakyoinI was on that fateful day!    And that, D'Arby, is why I can fightwith my very soul on the line!    Three, two, one!    They're neck and neck again!    The third corner!    That is why I, Noriaki Kakyoin,    will never be controlledby my fears.    That, I promise you!    All right! The fifth corner!In sync again!    They're both turningat the same speed!    Kakyoin! Damn you!    The sixth corner is coming up!    The speed tunnelcomes right after the sixth turn.    If you enter the tunnel,    you can doubleyour max speed to    km.    I've got to make it to the tunnel!    The tunnel is wide enoughfor only one car.    If they try to enter the tunnelside by side,    one of them is going to crash!    Sixth turn!They're still neck and neck!    The tunnel! I see the tunnel.    Kakyoin, push'm aside!    Haven't you realized, Kakyoin?    Do you really thinkyou can push me aside?    Look at your power meter!    Kakyoin has less power!    You used up your power    when you spun aroundand blocked me    back at the beginning of the race!    Two seconds untilwe reach the tunnel.    You're going to crash!Let him have the lead!    Go in the tunnel behind D'Arby!    I can't do that!    If he makes it to the tunnel first,there's no way I can win.    One second!    Kakyoin!    He went on two wheels!    Dammit!You're riding the tunnel walls.    Yes, Kakyoin! You can do it!    Push'm aside!    Quiet! You're ruiningmy concentration!    He's slamming into Kakyoin!    I don't care if I lose some power.    I need to get around that turnfaster than Kakyoin,    even if it's only a hundredthof a second sooner.    I need to get out of the tunnelbefore him, even if it means    I'm just one one-thousandthof a millimeter ahead!    Hey, what's wrong?I can't see the cars!    From here on, we have to get throughthe tunnel in darkness.    What?    Absolute darkness,where the radar is completely useless!    And there are eight turns,a landmine, and a cannon att*ck.    It remains darkuntil you're out of the tunnel.    One mistakeand you'll slam into the wall.    But I know exactlywhere the turns are.    And I'm sure D'Arby does too.    That's the cars turning.    What's happening? Where are they?    Who's ahead?    Three!    Two!    One!    Cannon att*ck!    For a second there,the blast lit up the cars!    Kakyoin is slightly behind.    The exit!They're about to exit the tunnel!     D'Arby is ahead!    He's one car length ahead!    I win!    I will never let down my guard.    You have less power than I!    I've grasped his soul!    Don't be ridiculous, Jotaro!    I know the rules of baseball.    It is impossible to back out now!    You should offer encouragementat times like this.    This is pathetic.
02x41 - D'Arby the Player, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:57They're about to exit the tunnel!  Oh! D'Arby is ahead!  He's one car length ahead!  Now our speed will double.  I win!  No!  I still have more powerthan you, D'Arby!  Which means...  Kakyoin's car just...   He spun and knockedD'Arby's car off the race track!   He was going     kilometers per hour!   He's out!   Kakyoin's car is safe on the ground.   He did it!   The car with less power losesin collisions.   Forfeiting your powerto ram me was a mistake.   You didn't realize that I intentionallystayed one car length behind   so I could spinand knock you off course.   Is that so?   Seems you're the onewho's missed something.   Losing power was not an accident.   I planned it so you would knockmy car off course!   Everything restson this one moment!   Look where my car is going now!   What?   He landed on the opposite sideof the track, farther ahead!   I don't believe it!   Yes, normally, it's impossible.   Normally, an attempt to make itto the opposite track   by hurdling overthe curve would result   in an abrupt collision with terra firma,even at     kilometers per hour.   You can't make it by jumpingover the curves.   But Kakyoin, it's another storyif you're catapulted over them.   All I needed was your help!   I sacrificed my powerso you would hit me.   It was all part of my plan.   Now, then,   Shall we proceedwith our race, Kakyoin?   Don't give up, Kakyoin!   Kakyoin!   There, his soul is mine.   He admitted defeat.   He knew it was pointlessto continue racing.   I must say Kakyoin,   you are the first opponentto ever make me perspire.   This Kakyoin doll will make a mostexquisite addition to my collection.   He was my first opponentto conquer his fears   and not cr*ck under pressure.   Kakyoin!   I will treasure himand his good company.   Careful.   I advise you to remain calmand not to att*ck me.   And that's not all.   I could slip on a banana peeland hit my head,   choke on a piece of gum,or suffer a heart att*ck   and die from something as simpleas someone popping a bag of popcorn.   Kakyoin's soul would go straightto heaven with me.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE PLAYER, PART     -Jotaro?-Oh?   Hey, Jotaro!Why are you sitting down?   I'll b*at him! I'm next!   Old man, have you even playedany of these games?   Stay out of this, old man.   We're not playing cardsor hanafuda here.   We're playing baseball next.   That's how we'll do this.   I bet my soul.   Good. I bet Kakyoin's soul.   There. My Stand, Atum,has released your arm.   Now that I have Kakyoin's soul,   there's no reason for me to keepmy Stand's hand on you.   And I'd be at a bit of a disadvantage   if I faced youwith my Stand one-handed.   I know your Star Platinumis swift and precise.   Of all the gamesyou could have chosen...   This one is my specialty.   D'Arby! The minute Jotaro beats you,I'll throttle you.   Don't forget that.   This game hasn't been tamperedwith either.   I'm certain.   First, pick your team.   Jaguars.   I see.   You selected a strong offensive team.   You have two batters with overa .    batting average.   Then I'll choose the Red Dragons.   Offense or defense?Take your pick.   Offense.   Fine. Jaguars will bat first.   You can design your own playersby drawing their faces.   This is Star Platinum.   Done.   Now, shall we play ball?   Jaguars versus Red Dragons.   Play ball!   TOP OF THE FIRST   I've chosen number    as my pitcher.   January  th is my birthday,you know.   Here we go.    The pitcher is winding up.    The first pitch!    What?    Strike one!    Hey, Jotaro.What did you just do?    You swung the bat before the pitchereven threw the ball!    Hey, Jotaro...    What are you practicingyour swing for?    No...    Is this the first timeyou've played this game?    Have you even playedvideo games before?    Answer me, Jotaro!    Relax. I know how to play baseball.    I'll figure outthe game's controls as I go.    What?    Your timing is totally off!    Your swings are pathetic!    This is your first time playing,isn't it?    Strike two!    Now you swung the bat afterthe catcher caught the ball!    You have no clue what you're doing!    Dammit, Jotaro!    You've never playeda video game before, have you?    Strike! Batter out!    Quit messing around, Jotaro!    Stop trying to act so cool!    You bet your soul!There's no backing out!    Good grief.    This is when you're supposedto cheer for me.    Like "It's only the first inning.The game's just started.    You can do it, Jotaro." Like that.    What are you thinking?    Star Platinum's reflexes mean nothing    if you don't know the first thingabout video games.    Do you honestly think you can b*at him?What's your plan, Jotaro?    What's going onin that head of yours?    Jotaro.    If you're trying to trick meby pretending to be an amateur,    it's not going to work.    I'd never let my guard down,not even against a child!    I've bet a soul,and I will not hold back.    Old man.    I have no plan.    My only "plan" is to knock    the nose straight off the condescending,over-inflated douchebag    taking up space beside me.    All I care about is gettingKakyoin's soul back.    Say what you'd like.    It's still the top of the first inning,and you have one out.    There's still more game to play.    And remember,    if you fall more thaneleven points behind,    you lose.    Second batter, number three.    Strike!    He's getting worse!    He was over    centimeters abovethe ball when he swung!    Strike two!    Not even close!    Strike three! You're out!    It's all over.    He's no competition for him.    It's like the high schoolbaseball champs    going against the tea ceremony club.    It's pathetic.    Strike!    Strike two!    It looks like he really is a beginner.This is too easy!    In the same waythat a judo pro can gauge    his opponent's skill simply by lookingat the way he wears his gi,    I can tellJotaro is a complete video game novice!    But I will never let my guard down.    I know every batter's weaknessin this game.    Next will be a low pitchto the outside.    I'll throw my best pitch,the four-seam fast ball,    and strike him out!    First inning, two outs,two strikes, no fouls.    Here comes my next pitch.    Go ahead.    I pretty much got the hangof batting now.    What did he just say?    "Got the hang of it"?    What?    He can't have...    What is he talking about?    What does he mean?    What?    Jotaro!    Good. This game is pretty fun.    Huh? It can't be...    It's going. The ball is still going!    What did he say just now?    He just "got the hangof batting now"?    Got the hang of it?    It's good!    You've got to be kidding me!No way!    Home run!    A home run!    Jotaro!    What did you just say?    "I got the hang of it"?    Did you really say,"I pretty much got the hang of batting"?    I'm not going to say it again.    He was a beginner.    He learned how to swingwith just eight pitches?    Jotaro Kujo has all the speedand dexterity of Star Platinum.    Now I know why Master Diofinds him to be problematic.    Now I know why my brother lost.    Interesting. I couldn't have askedfor a more fitting opponent.    But revealing your talentsso early in the game,    that, my friend, is a mistakeyou will regret.    The game continues, Jotaro.    He did it!    He did it again!    Another home run!    You scored four runsin the first inning!    Looks like you've got this gamein the bag, Jotaro!    Keep it up! Keep going!    Hey, D'Arby.    I know you'll turna deaf ear to me,    but I'll say it anywaycause I'm a nice guy.    If you return Kakyoin's souland take us to Dio,    we'll spare your life.    My brother was a master gamblerand a genius con artist.    Yet he never said,    "Terrence, let's playa game of poker."    Not even once.    Why do you think that is?    When I was fifteen, I caught my brothermaking a move on my girlfriend.    He was ten years older than me,and I b*at him to a bloody pulp.    I broke his ribs and kicked himuntil he vomited blood.    The last thing he eversaid to me was, "I'm sorry."    Do you know why?    Cut to the chase, bastard!    Ever since we were kids,    my brother knewhe could never b*at me.    And there's a reason for that.    Right now, you may appear confident,hitting home run after home run.    But you feel a sense of unease,    just like my brotherdid all those years ago.    My prowess worries you, doesn't it?    You're thinking,"No... Maybe... It can't be..."    Right, Jotaro?    What are you talking about?    I'm changing pitchers!    Number    is out.Number    is in.    Number    is a power pitcher witha maximum pitch speed of     km/h.    I'll also tell you my pitch.    Number    will throw a forkballright down the middle!    What? He's declaringwhat he's throwing?    A forkball right down the middle.    Do you believe me or not?    Jotaro, he's just trying to shakeyour confidence.    Just ignore him!    Throw the ball, D'Arby.    To believe or not to believe?    It's coming right at him!    It's a fastball!    Is it going to change direction?    What's going to happen?    He swung!Jotaro bet on the forkball!    But it's not changing direction!It's a fastball!    He hit the bottom of the ball!    Out!    First inning!Three outs! Change!    FIRST INNING    You idiot!    You fell for it?You swung for a forkball!    No.    He already knew I would swingfor a forkball.    He knew before he threw the ball,so he switched to a fastball.    And he's right.    I've been worried ever sincewe stepped foot into this mansion.    He somehow knew that Star Platinumwould throw a left punch.    That's impossible!    Are you trying to tell mehe can read your mind?    It's my turn at bat.    This will be a home run.    I'll hit a home run right intothe left-field bleachers.    Old man.    You're sure the gameand console are good, right?    I'm positive.    And I haven't seen him makeany funny moves either.    Then the secret is his Stand.    His Stand doesn't just take souls.    He has another ability.    I'm going to aim for...    Now I'll get to the bottom of this.    What? He's going to try to hitthe batter on purpose?    Where might you be aiming now?An inside pitch?    Will you throw it high?    Or low?    Are you planning some sort of trick?    What? He pulled back the secondJotaro threw the ball!    He knew exactlywhat was going to happen!    There's no wayhe could have done that    without reading Jotaro's mind.    Home run!    That's one run.    Damn.    We've faced all kinds of opponents,but never one who could read our minds.    If he can really read our minds,    then it doesn't matter how smartor strong we think we are.    We don't stand a chance!    Jotaro, what are you going to do?    BOTTOM OF THE FIRST    Damn it! He's declaringanother home run.    Let's see.Will it be an outside pitch?    Or are you going to aim low?    Perhaps a fastball?    Four to two.    A person's body languageand the surrounding environment    can sometimes help predictan opponent's next move.    But never perfectly.    His Stand predicts Jotaro's pitchwith    % accuracy.    And technically he's not cheating!    Another home run!It's four to three!    How do we stop himfrom reading our minds?    How?    I'll be in the lead in no time.    Now, will your next movebe an inside pitch?    A fastball? A high pitch?Perhaps a curveball?    Oh, what do youhave up your sleeve?    Your hat...    Heh, you fool.     Do you honestly thinkI'd cheat like my brother?    Jotaro, that's not it!    Hiding your facewith your hat won't help.    He's not watching the reflectionof the screen in your eyes.    There's no way he can seewhat you're pressing    or what pitch you're choosing.    I've been watching him.That's not what's going on.    I'm sweating.    That's why I took it off.    Please hurry upand throw your next pitch.    But I won't besweating anymore.    I'll tell you my next pitch.    I'm throwinga high, outside fastball.    What?    What?What did you just say, Jotaro?    Just as I said.    Losing your hearing, old man?    I just told him my next pitch.    I'm going to throw a high,outside fastball.    Jotaro!    To believe?Or not to believe?     Not too bright, are you?    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    What did you just say, Jotaro?    I said I was going to declare my pitch.    -Jotaro is not lying.-Yes.    -You rigged the console somehow!-No.    Your school hat provesthat you're cheating!    It's not cheatingif you don't get caught.

Losing your hearing, old man?  I just told him my next pitch.  I'm going to throwa high, outside fastball.  Jotaro!  To believe?Or not to believe?  Not too bright, are you?  My Stand can peer intoyour soul in the same way   that a thermal imager detectsan object's radiation.   It doesn't matter what Jotaro may say,his soul cannot lie.   Yes or no? Right or left?   By analyzing your soul, I can seethe answer to any yes-or-no question.   Outside or inside? High or low?   Fastball or curveball?   My Stand is infallible.    A high, outside fastball?    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART      Yes or no?   Jotaro is telling the truth.   He's going to pitcha high, outside fastball.   This is no ruse.   What is he up to?   He b*at my brother by bluffing,   but he thinksthat will work with me?   You fool!   Here it comes.   Don't forget, you loseif you fall eleven runs behind.   What? A curve!   That wasn't a high,outside fastball!   And he hit it!   But it's a grounder!Throw to first! He's out!   I don't believe it.   There was no way he wasn't throwinga high, outside fastball.   No one's soul can lie.Not even the great Buddha's.   Not even my brother's,the world's greatest con man!   Next is another high, outside fastball.   He's not lying. He's serious!   Jotaro, you don't intend to have mebelieve you're cheating right now, do you?   I do!   What?   He's cheating?   A low, inside forkball!   Fly ball! The pitcher caught it!   Out!   You cheated!Jotaro, you bastard!   You must've tamperedwith the console!   What?   So he didn't tamper with it?   I know you're cheating!   Now come clean!   No response.   Damn! I have to aska yes-or-no question!   Looks like you can readmy thoughts   only when it's a yes-or-no question.   Like your brother used to say,   it's not cheatingif you aren't caught.   It's not cheatingif you aren't caught?   How dare you?   Do you knowwho you're talking to?   Go ahead and pitch, Jotaro!   I'll figure out your trickand take your soul!   Now, then.Shall we continue?   My next pitch will be...   A high, outside fastball.   Jotaro's soul isn't lying.   He is genuinely goingto pitch a high, outside fastball.   I'll figure outhow you're cheating!   This ends now!   He hasn't changed his mind.   It's still a "yes."He's going to throw it!   Here it comes!   It's still a "yes."He threw a fastball!   It tumbled! A forkball!   What? It's a different pitch!   Out! That's three outs! Change!   I don't get it! I can't figure outhow he's cheating?   Jotaro's soul kept sayinghe'd throw a fastball,   but it curved!   How is he deceiving me?   You're done for, D'Arby.   Shut up!   It's the hat!Why did you take off your hat?   You've been cheatingever since you took that hat off!   Move! I'm checkingyour station and controller.   Damn you!How did you do it?   I don't suppose, it has somethingto do with that hat,   does it?   The culprit is somewherearound here!   You're using Star Platinumto cheat, aren't you?   You're doing something, Jotaro!Admit it!   Damn it!   I can read people's minds!   And I can read Jotaro's thoughts!   How does his mind throwthe ball one way,   but his body throws it another?   He, uh... looks like he's losinghis youthful glow.   He definitely doesn't look likea guy in his twenties anymore.   D'Arby, it's your turn.    Hurry up and throw it.    Four to three...    Only a one-point difference.I can b*at him.    I am a video game genius!    I cannot lose.    I am a video game genius!    I cannot lose.My mind is a steel trap.    I've won every match!I'm invincible!    A video game expertis an expert at life!    You thinkyou can shake my confidence?    It's in! It's a home run!    Another run for the Jaguars!    It's five to three!    No! I inadvertentlyreleased his soul!    Kakyoin's soul just...He's conscious!    No! I didn't admit defeat!    It was an accident!Releasing his soul was a mistake!    If you released his soul,then that means...    your soul admitted defeat.    What?    Joseph's Stand,he entwined it around the controller.    Oh, whoops.    Something so idiotic...    The cheat was...The one manipulating the controller...    Damn it...    So Jotaro wasn't controlling it.It was you, Joseph Joestar!    That's right, D'Arby.    I'm sure your brother would havefigured it out a long time ago.    By the way, old man.    I'm glad you caught on to my secret idea.    Of course! I know exactlywhat you're thinking!    You're my grandson!    Come on, Kakyoin.    Damn it... From behind...    Now...    What to do with you?    You have to forgive me!I gave you Kakyoin's soul back!    Everything's back to normal now!    We're good! Right?    If you want to knowwhether I'll forgive you,    why don't you just read my mind?    Tell me, will I hit youwith my right fist or my left?    Guess.    Just get it over with.You'll use your right.    Your left?    Both?    Are you going to dothe "ora-ora" thing?    Yes! Oh my God!    D'Arby Younger: Out of commission!    Looks like we broke throughsome sort of wall.    That's our ticket out of here,Jotaro! Kakyoin!    Good grief.    Forgive me for disturbing you, master,    but as I'm sure you arealready aware,    about ten minutes ago,    Joestar and his comradesinfiltrated the manor.    I must also inform youthat D'Arby has been defeated.    D'Arby was a genius.    With such competence and acumen,D'Arby should have won.    Why do you thinkhe suffered defeat?    Come in, Cool Ice.    As you wish.    The Joestars    are unconditionally preparedto sacrifice their own lives    in order to save their family.    Kakyoin and the other two...    What were their names...    Ah, yes...    Avdol and Polnareff are willingto die to destroy me.    They believe running from mewould mean running from themselves.    Such fools.    But that is their strength.    D'Arby may have swornhis loyalty to me,    but he was not preparedto die on my behalf.    That is why, at the edge of glory,he could not clinch victory.    For all eternity,D'Arby will remain in ignorance.    Ice...    Look at the scar on my neck.    Jonathan Joestar's bodyis still rejecting me.    But all it takes is the bloodof one more soul.    The body will become mine,and the wound will heal.    Ice...    Will you give me your life's blood?    Yes, master. With pleasure.    What is mine is yours!    You beheaded yourself.    Most splendid.    But Cool Ice,    I cannot accept the bloodof such a loyal servant.    I shall heal my woundwith another's blood.    You must live.    To your rebirth.    Your resolve shall secureyour victory.    Dio, my lord.    One's own body is always best.    You are ready.    Take care of them, Cool Ice.    Lord Dio...    I will not let you down.    I promise, I shall destroyevery one of them.    You need not helpwith the door.    Your Stand can completely vanishfrom this dimension.     COOL ICE    The ten minutes are up.    Mister Joestar said to setthe mansion ablaze,    but I say we go in after them.    Yeah.    Before we proceed, there's somethingI have to tell you, Polnareff.    If you lose your way or are injuredand can't go on,    I will not save you.    Iggy, the same goes for you.    I know it sounds cruel,    but we've come here to defeat Dio.    If I become injuredor separated from you,    promise me you won't attemptto save me either.    You must think of your own safetyfirst and foremost.    We can't let ourselves get k*lledtrying to save one another.    Yeah, I got it, Avdol.    If we get out of here alive,    you'd better treat meto a mind-blowing feast of a dinner.    I'll treat you and Iggy, both.    All right, let's go.    Silver Chariot!    Hey, Avdol. What should we do?    It looks like it goes on forever.    I know Mister Joestar told usto set the mansion on fire,    but this structure isan immense labyrinth.    Setting it alight would put us allin grave danger.    Instead...    Magician's Red!    The flames detect lifeforms.    They will sense anything that breathes,human or animal.    They can even detect cutaneous respirationand minute movements.    They will also sense a Stand's energy.    The flames will lead the way.    Why are there six flames?    There is a flame for each ofthe four directions,    as well as ones for the spaceabove and below us.    If something is hiddenwithin fifteen meters,    regardless of size,the flames will detect its presence.    Mister Joestar and the otherswere pulled below us.    Let's head down.    The flames alreadypicked up something.    There's something in front of us,to the left.    What?    The Fool!    Hey. Who is this guy?    -Look around us, Polnareff!-Huh?    The maze! It's gone!    His Stand created this illusion.    When Iggy slashed him, it vanished.    His name, Billie Jean.Defeated without resistance!    The mansion is back to normal.    For now, at least,the flames aren't detecting anything.    HE WHO READS THIS CARVINGAND TURNS ABACK SHALL...    HE WHO READS THIS CARVINGAND TURNS ABACK SHALL...     PERISH    The flames don't sense anything.    Iggy hasn't picked upanything, either.    What is this thing?    Impossible! My flamesand Iggy's nose didn't sense it!    Where did it come from?    Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!    Hey, Avdol! Where are you?    What was that just now?    Whose arms are those?    Hey, Avdol!    Where are you?    Avdol!    Where are you?    Avdol!    Avdol!    What the hell is that?    Where did it come from?    Why didn't Avdol's flames sense it?    Hey, Iggy!    You couldn't smell himwith your nose?    Answer me!    Where are you, Avdol?    Where did you go?    Avdol...    has been disintegrated.He is dead.    Beyond my jaws liesan endless void.    A dark dimension unto whichmy own understanding reaches not.    Your ally is already gone.    You two are next.    Your arrogance will not last.    One by one, each in his place,    I shall strew your atomic fragmentsacross the void.    I don't believe you.    It's impossible.    Avdol can't be dead.    You lie!    -Is fate telling me to live on?-I heard another wall fall down.    -More sounds of destruction?-He's full of spite.    I will eliminate you.    Don't let his spite overcome you!    -There's no time to deal with the pain.-Suck on my sword and die!

One by one, each in his place,  I shall strew your atomic fragmentsacross the void.   It's impossible...   Avdol can't be dead.   You lie!   What?   Polnareff's Standcan att*ck this swiftly?   And at such distances? Astonishing.   Look over here,you good-for-nothing maggot!    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART      What was that?    When we broke through the mirage,   I think I heard a wall collapsedeep in the mansion.   Do you think Avdol and Polnareff...   Damn it! I know I hit him,but he's not dead.   He cannibalized himselfinto the abyss.   He and his Stand!   Avdol... Damn it.   You said it yourself.   Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!   You told us to look outfor ourselves.   You said you wouldn't save me.   You liar!   You've been meddlingin other people's business   ever since we set foot in India!   Avdol! Why couldn't youjust leave me alone?   If I hadn't ducked just now,I'd be a dead man.   It's fate;something's telling me to carry on.   Avdol must be telling meto fight back.   This room is way too dangerous.   We've got to get out of here, Iggy!   Come on, Iggy! Upstairs!   We're going upstairs!   The exit!That's the door we came in!   But I can't leave.   Avdol sacrificed himselfto save us.   Because he believed in us,that we can defeat Dio.   I can't... I won't let him down!   I refuse to turn backlike some coward.   I'm not running away.   I'm running to get closer to Dio!   And these stairs aren'tgoing to slow me down!   I expected himto dash out the door.   Such a pity...   Impressive. He managed a hit.   Polnareff's mental fortitudeemboldens him   to conquer his own fearsand face immanent death.   I shall corner himand obliterate his body.   There is no question.   He is no match for my Stand.   His Stand's jaws are the gatewayto an alternate dimension?   A dark, unimaginable abyss...   All I know is that he can move aboutour realm without making a sound,   without leaving the faintestscent or sign of life.   But how...   How can I b*at him?   He cut us off!   He's close.   He's here!   Iggy, watch my back!   I'll watch yours.   He can't reach usif he can't break through the wall.   As long as he emergesfrom the dark beyond,   I can k*ll him.   Come at me, bastard!I'll slice you in two!   You've got me pissed, which makesmy Chariot all the faster!   I've lost Avdol,and I'm not letting you get away!   What? He's hiding in the cr*ckunder my foot?   Chariot!   My foot!   That was so...   you can't run away!   Bastard!   Not so fast.   Mister Joestar!It's that shaking again!   It has to be Avdol and Polnareff.   They've come in after us,and they're fighting somewhere.   Come on!We have to find them, fast!   You've managedto hide amid the chaos, Polnareff.   Such futility.   With that injury, you won't go far.   You must be hidingbeneath the rubble.   You are helpless against me.You shall die by my hand.   Now, where are you, Polnareff?   That's quite the ruckus, Cool Ice.   Lord Dio!   Take heed, my lord!   Polnareff and that mongrelare hiding nearby.   Allow me to be of assistance.   You must not trouble yourself.   A fake Dio made from The Fool!We got him!   Attacking from behindmight be cowardly.    You'd think I'd feel guilty.    But you k*lled Avdol from behind.    I'll show you no mercy!    This is the death you deserve!    Do it, Iggy!    Quarter the bastard,shoulder to hip!    Fillet that scoundrel!    You're kidding!He figured it out!    The sun enters this room.    Lord Dio would never...    enter this room by day.    Iggy!    The real Lord Diobestowed me with his trust.    He entrusted mewith the honor of k*lling you.    That is why Lord Dio would never descendto the second floor!    No! He's going to k*ll Iggy!    He'll be swallowed upinto the abyss!    You damn, pathetic dog!    How dare you force meto destroy Lord Dio's likeness?    What? He punched him!    He didn't use the void!    He punched Iggywithout k*lling him!    Do you have any idea...    I don't care if it was a fakemade of sand!    You made me destroy it!    I'll kick you to death,you filthy mutt!    It would take only an instantto absorb you into my dark abyss!    That won't satiate my fury!    It's your fault!    It's your faultfor making me angry!    It's your fault!    Time to learn your lesson!How's that?    I'll teach you!And this? Better?    Stop...    Cool Ice is crazy.    He's insane!    He's lost it becausehe destroyed that pile of sand    that looked like Dio?    His soul is the murky abyss!    His soul is the inky hellthat obliterates all!    Lord Dio said    the resolve of the human heartmust never be underestimated.    But you're just a filthy stray!    You have no resolve.    Your soul knowsnothing of pride!    Stop...    Take that! And that!    Stop...    How do you like that? And that?    Stop it, Cool Ice!    I will end this, Polnareff!    sh*t!    He disappeared!    But...    Iggy!    Our Stand decoymay've fallen through,    but your sandmight've just saved us.    Now I know how to find him!    I can see him.I can see him moving!    How do you like that! We did it!    Damn you!    When you move,    you have to absorbeverything in your path.    So swallow this!    Take a big mouthful of sandand come here, you piece of sh*t!    And when you peek outfrom behind your Stand's putrid teeth,    I'll finish you off!    Bull's-eye! Yeah!Eat that!    I found your weakness, Cool Ice!    Your attempt to pinpoint my locationleaves you vulnerable!    You can't see me without emergingfrom your dark dimension!    Suck on this!    Suck on my sword and croak, bastard!    You bastard...    I've skewered your throatand your brain stem!    Die, damn it!You're supposed to be dead!    Hurry up and die!    Die, Cool Ice!    I cannot die.    I do not have time to feel pain.    I will k*ll you without fail!    I will swallow Iggy,the Joestars, and anyone left!    I can die after that!    You bastard!    Good boy.You've withdrawn your sword.    This time, I'll send you to hell!    Is this the vile armthat stabbed me?    You bastard!    Damn it! I had no choicebut to shove him away!    No!    Not so fast, buddy!    I got him! But...    Damn it! He got my leg.I can't move.    But I can't think about the pain!    I almost got him!    This guy is different.    He's vengeful to the core.    And he's not just nuts.    He's consumedwith devotion to Dio!    I won't let him get the upper hand!    I can't die until I k*ll you!    Damn him! Here he comes!    Take this!    It's no use.It got part of my sword!    It's impossible to att*ck himwhen he's hidden in the abyss.    It'll just swallow me whole.    He's absorbing the buildingat random! Damn it!    The bastard knows I'll att*ck himif he shows himself.    So he's blindly attackingfrom every angle!    He's good.    At this rate,he'll hit me for sure.    I have to pull back Chariot.    Damn it...Iggy's losing too much blood.    His broken ribsmust've punctured his lungs.    Talk about insane...He's devouring the walls.    No... I was wrong!    This isn't random.It's all part of his plan!    He's drawing circles around me,smaller, concentric circles!    He's making a spiral.    Like a giant mosquito coil.He's closing in!    It doesn't matterif he doesn't know our location.    He doesn't haveto break out of the abyss.    He'll hit us anyway!    He's got usright where he wants us.    There's no wayI can dodge him with this leg!    I've got to carve an openingin the floor to get away!    Damn.I don't have enough time!    He's coming right for us!    Somehow I dodged...    But he's closing inlike a needle on a record.    In about five more rounds,he'll be here!    The question is...    How do I dodgewith this injured leg?     SELECT THE BEST ANSWERFROM THE FOLLOWING THREE OPTIONS:      . THE HANDSOME POLNAREFF WILL DEVISE     THE PERFECT COUNTERATTACKJUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.      . HIS FRIENDS WILLCOME AND SAVE HIM.      . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DODGE THE att*ck.LIFE IS A BITCH.    If it were up to me,option two would become my reality.    But I can't count on that.    They entered the mansionten minutes before us.    There's no waythey'll just appear out of thin air    like some American comic book hero,swooping in to save the day.    For all I know, they might bein the middle of a fight themselves.    Looks like option oneis my only choice.    Chariot! Pull me out of the circleas fast as you can!    Damn it! Pull me faster!    It's no use!    Damn! So it's option three.    Life is a bitch.    Silver Chariot is a Standthat fights with a saber.    It doesn't have the powerto pull my weight,    especially when I'm injured.    Blast it...    You're all torn up!Just stay still, stupid!    If you moveor use your Stand's power,    your broken ribs will sink deeperinto your lungs and you'll die!    Just cut out the tough-guy act,you idiot!    Are you trying to die beside me?    I'm the onewho's going to save you!    You have to live on    to tell Mister Joestar and the othersabout this bastard.    You have to defeat him!    Avdol might've saved me,but you sure as hell better not!    If we all die,everything will be in vain!    One more loop and he's got me.    So it is number three.    Life is cruel.    Guess he wanted victorymore than I did.    So long, Iggy.    This blood is not your doing.    It is Avdol's.    I don't know the details.    I have really bad luckwith friends.    Not to the likes of you!    It happens every time.
02x44 - The Miasma of the Void, Vanilla Ice, Part 3 / The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 3QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:58What the...This carnage...  It's perfectly spherical, like someonepulled a cork out of the wall.  What in God's name...  It's not just here. The destructionspreads into the other room.  There's no question.  Avdol and the othershave had a brush with evil!  Jotaro! Break down this door!We're going in!  Yes.  So long, Iggy.    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART     Polnareff. The blood that stainsmy body is not your handiwork.   It is Avdol's.   My plan was to simultaneouslyeradicate you both,   but Avdol pushed youout of harm's way.   Anyone else would haveinstinctively saved himself.   He is the one responsiblefor my injuries.   I may be injured,but I am far from death.   Now I shall k*ll the other three!   They will not survive,I assure you.   Dammit, Iggy.I told you not to use your Stand.   You had to show off...   I told you not to do it.   Polnareff!   To Cool Ice, he was a filthy stray.A soul without resolve.   A soul that knew no pride.   But a Stand is a manifestationof the soul.   Iggy's soul actedof its own volition.   Something had compelled it to action.   The sand... I can feel it.But it's a Stand...   How could this have happened?Damn it!   It's a lifeless remnant.A vestige of a Stand...   I feel the chill of death.A life cut short.   Damn!Why am I the one who survived?   Ig...   Iggy!   You're slow, Cool Ice.And it's as you say.   Life is cruel.My friends have all left me.   I was supposed to save Iggy,but instead, he saved me.   Damn it!   How could this be happening?   I only now realizewhat he meant to me.   It always happens this way.   It's always after they're gone.   You may've beena miserable little mutt,   but you always impressed me.You were stubborn.   You lived life by your own rules,not by the whims of others.   Now I understand.   Your indifference to us wasa product of your self-respect.   I told you not to save me.   Damn! Why did you haveto be so stubborn?   I knew it.I know what you are, Cool Ice.   I knew something was strange.   You're immortal.Dio's changed you somehow.   What's happening to me?   You didn't even notice it yourself?   He gave you his blood, didn't he?   I never would have guessed.You're turning into a vampire.   Your body is just like Dio's.   A soulless, filthy vampire!   You bastard!   I must have k*lled your old body   when I drove that saberthrough your gullet.   Bring it!   Come on!What are you waiting for?   Didn't you swearto protect "Lord" Dio?   Come and get me! I'm right here!   What's wrong, Cool Ice?I'm waiting!   You're not going to...   Burn in Hell.   Avdol. Iggy!   Am...   Am I seeing things?   Or...   There's no time.I have to go upstairs   and reach Dio.   Mourning can wait.    AVDOL: DECEASEDIGGY: DECEASED   THE FOOLIGGY   Japan.   Forty-three days have passedsince Jojo and crew began their journey.   Stop the car, Rosas.   I said, stop the car.   SOBA AJIDOKORO   Madam, you don't really intendto visit that soba stand, do you?   Of course I do!   It's been so longsince I've been in Japan.   I'd like a quick bitebefore I go see my daughter.   You! Hold my turtle for me.   You mustn't, Madam!   In Japan, these kindsof establishments are frequented   by common businessmen,not by ladies like yourself.   Madam Joestar, you mustn't.   Oh, calm down. It's so quaint,I have to record it.   How utterly fantastic!   Such local flavor...Good!    NO VOMITING OR PEEING   Mister Rosas.   Have you told Madamabout her daughter Holly's condition?   Over here, Rosas! Hurry!    Coming, Madam!    I haven't uttered a word.    She came to Japan to visit Holly    under the assumptionthat she has pneumonia.    I've worked for the Joestar familyfor    years.    And I've known Lady Hollysince she was in grade school.    I know I haveto tell her the truth,    but I don't havethe heart to tell her.    Being in Japan hasn't changed that.    Holly is at death's door.    She has only a few days left.    Would you like me to tell her, sir?    No. I've been lyingto Madam Joestar long enough.    I shall tell her myself.    Is it true that Holly will be curedif Dio is defeated?    Yes, if we destroy him.    Holly's body is reactingto a certain energy known as a Stand.    Only people with Standscan observe the phenomenon.    Put simply, Dio's evil energyis slowing destroying her.    Madam cannot see Stands.    But she will see her only daughteris in the final throes of death.    You must tell Madam now.    Throes of death?    Rosas, what are you doing out here?    Come have some curry udon with me.    Madam, there's somethingI must tell you.    Oh! I must get some footage     of this fascinatinghealth-drink vending machine!    Good!Would you like one, Rosas?    Madam, please stop!Those are not drinks!    Please listen to me, Madam!    Oh? What is it?    Well, it's about Lady Ho--    Look at this Japanese man!Such a unique fashion sense!    Very nice!    Good!    Hello, give me a smile!    What the hell?     Who gave you permissionto videotape me, huh?    Madam, please get back in the car!    Yay!    Come back here, damn it!Messing with me, huh?    Gimme that camera!    Who the hell are you?Damn foreign hag!    Looking to see some blood, bitch?Huh?    That's quite enough.    I forbid you to lay a fingeron the Madam.    Madam! You need to learna bit more about Japan!    Okay.    I couldn't tell her    that Lady Hollyhas only a few days left.    To bear such sorrowful news.To traumatize her so...    We're almost here.I still haven't told her.    Soon we'll be in sightof the Kujo house.    I must tell her now.    I must be the one to tell her!    Rosas.    I know there's somethingyou're trying to tell me.    I know what's troubling you.    My daughter's lifeis in danger, isn't it?    When I called her from New York,    Holly would try to be cheerfuland pretend.    She said it was just a cold.    Joseph would alwayscall me on his trips,    saying he was fine and very busy.    But I knew...    I knew something terriblewas happening    to my daughter and husband.    I've been married to himfor fifty years.    She's my own flesh and blood.    I was scared.    I was scared of what I would find.    I so much wantedto see my daughter,    but the thought of going to Japanwas too much.    Since you are aware of the situation,we will tell you the truth.    Your daughter has onlya few more days to live.    Mister Joestar and the otherstraveled to Egypt    to eliminate the sourceof her illness,    but we haven't heardfrom them since.    Please forgive mefor not telling you, Madam.    There was nothingwe could do for Lady Holly,    it was too difficult.    It was so cruel!    What kind of foolishnessis that, Rosas?    There is one thingwe can do for Holly.    Holly.    Mother...    Rosas, listen carefully.    What we can do for my daughteris believe.    I don't understandthe whole picture, but I know    if Joseph and my grandson, Jotaro,are trying to save Holly,    I will put my faith behind them.    He has never let me down,    not since the day we metin Italy fifty years ago.    If he says he's goingto do something, he will do it.    Believe in Jotaro and your father.    You'll get better, and our familywill be together again.    Mother...    Madam... Miss Holly...    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Cool Ice, Billie Jean,D'Arby Younger...    I knew you were incompetent fools!    I can't help but laugh!Serves them right!    Oh the satisfaction,oh the sweet vindication!    That's what they getfor calling me a loser.    Guess who's the loser now!    Pathetic loser.    There's no way you can defeatthe Joestars with that power.    Shut up and get out of the way.    Hey! I want to fight them, too.    You're just an ordinary vampire.    Get in our way and we'll k*ll you.    Behave yourself, loser.    I'll be the onewho finishes off Jotaro!    Stop! There's something up ahead,to the right.    It's a woman...    Please have mercy!    Please don't suck my blood!    I'll do anything you want!Just don't k*ll me, please!    Hey, just wait a second.Calm down.    I swear I won't run away anymore!Please, have mercy on my soul!    Just calm down!    We aren't Dio's minions,and we aren't vampires.    We're the good guys.    We'll help you,but you need to calm down.    Good guys...    Good guys? You're not the vampires?    You're really going to help me?    That's right. We're good.    Good at defending justice.    Sure, we'll help you.    Help you go straight to Hell!    Right, Kakyoin?    This is impossible!How did you do it?    How did you figure it out?    My power is impossible to cr*ck!    Is your power having the faceof a woman on the back of your head?    If you're going to flip your head,    you should make sureyour hands match.    Damn, you're right!    I never noticed. Blast it!    All right, loser.    Tell us where's Dio's room.    Jotaro, don't knock him out.We need him to take us to Dio.    Why, you...    How dare you call me that?I'll show you!    I'll k*ll you!    Lord Dio's blood flows throughmy veins. I'm immortal!    Oh? Did you just sayyou were immortal?    So you're a vampire just like Dio.    Then let me test how immortalyou really are.    You know, for future reference.    Oh my God!    I see. You really are immortal.    Vampire or not, we can still tear youinto a million little pieces.    Come on. Take us to Dio.The sun's about to set.    Okay. But may I ask you one thing?    How did you knowthey call me "loser"?    Good grief.    Nice curtains, Dio has.    Now I can walk, even jump.    It still hurts,but now's not the time to fret.    Finally, Polnareff.We meet at last.    Dio.    At last you show yourself.    So we finally meet, Dio.    I don't have fond memories of them.    I do not regret this journey.    I'll tell you everythingthat just happened.    Not good.Something here is not good!    When did he bring out that Stand?    I shall give you one chance.
02x45 - DIO's World, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:59At last you show yourself,  Dio!  Bravo, Polnareff.You managed to avenge your sister  while traveling all the wayfrom the Far East.  To celebrate I shall gladlytake your life.  I'll give you one chance.  Descend two steps and live.  I'll let you be my servant again.  If you choose death,rise forth to me.   At our first encounter,fear overcame me like a curse.   I let myself submit to your evil.   It was the beginningof a futile existence.   An existence more horrifyingthan death itself.   a life consumed by the sole desireto do your bidding.   But that fear is gone.   The only thing that consumes me nowis a burning will to fight.   In the    days since I first metMr. Joestar and the others,   I've traveled the globe and watchedmy friends die at my feet.   I'll never be scared of you again.   Are you sure about that?   Then climb these stairs.   Interesting, Polnareff.   You've descended the stairs.   So you do want to serve me,after all.   What?   But I went up the stairs.I'm positive...   What's wrong?You appear shaken, Polnareff.   Could it be that you're scared?   In your mindyou thought you stepped up,   but perhaps your descent is a caseof fear overriding consciousness...   That's impossible!I know I just climbed the stairs!   What did he do?Is it his Stand?   Could it be...   Dio's Stand...   The World?   What is...    Polnareff, ever wonderwhat the human soul desires most?   It is human nature to wantto overcome anxiety and fear,   to live free from worry.   People seek fame,   they control others,they acquire wealth.   All for a sense of security.   Marriage and friendship is merelya means of securing peace of mind.   Humans say they wishto help others,   for the sake of love and justice.   But this is only to settletheir own minds.   The foremost desireof the human psyche   is to achieve a senseof secure serenity.   Why then would youpossibly hesitate in serving me?   If you do my bidding,all I speak of will be yours.   Are you not afraid to challenge me?   You know that your deathwill be certain.   It can't be!Am I unconsciously submitting to him?   You are a talented Stand user.   It would be a shame to k*ll you.   Betray Joestar and becomemy everlasting assistant.   I promise you unending peace.   I must resist.   Avdol, Iggy,I need your courage!   Cut the crap, Dio!   I've already d*ed once.   If I die trying to figure out   your Stand's abilities,then so be it!   Then you leave me no choice.   Prepare to die, Polnareff!   Is that The World? Bring it!   Futile!   Mister Joestar!   Don't worry, Polnareff.   Dio!   Was that Dio?   Come on,before he gets away!   I have somethingI have to tell you first.   I saw him use his Stand,but only for a moment.   Or, well, I didn't so muchsee it as feel it...   I can't explain exactly.   Look, here's what happened.   I was climbingthe stairs toward him,   when all of a sudden,I was below where I started!   I know it doesn't make any sense.   I don't get it either.I don't know what he did.   I feel like I'm going crazy.   And it wasn't some hypnosis trickor feat of supersonic speed.   It was a sense of somethingwholly and completely terrifying.   Where are Avdol and Iggy?   They didn't make it.   They d*ed trying to save me.   I see.   Mister Joestar, the sun is setting.   We need to hurry.   You're right.   Hey, loser. What's upstairs?   The towers.   There's also a room at the top.   It's Lord Dio's dwellingduring the day.   Is there another staircaseto the tower?   No. These stairs are it.   Fine, lead the way.   So that's him.    We've never met, but I've knownabout him my entire life.    Yes. I've known him all along.    Since the day I was born.    The same goes for Jotaro.    We'd hoped this daywould never come.    But we always knewwe had to destroy him.    As Joestars we knew,    one day, we would haveto come face-to-face with him.    I have no regrets.    About the journey I've made,or what's about to unfold.    I accept it all.To me, it's never been clearer.    This feeling. I feel embracedby lightness, by good.    Dio is the absence of light.The void.    Joseph and Jotaro are my light.    My body is battered,but I have no fear.    I have goodness, the light,by my side!    We att*ck when he stepsout of the coffin.    Be ready.    Who knows what's in there.    Loser, open the coffin.    Lord Dio, I swear,I haven't betrayed you.    I led them here because I knowyou will dispose of them.    I'm certain of it!    As certain as a man wets himselfwhen pissing in the wind.    Please understand!    Shut up and open the coffin!    Please, oh please,k*ll these bastards,    Lord Dio!    Get ready, this is it!    Huh?    Me?    Why am I inside?    -But I was opening the coffin!-What?    How?    I never took my eyes off him!    Did any one of you seethe loser get in    or get placed in the coffin?    No. I was watchingthe whole time,    and then, suddenly,he was inside!    Polnareff's right!    This isn't a mind trick.And it's not super speed!    sh*t.    This isn't some game!    Run for it!    Damn it!    What are you doing, Polnareff?    Damn it!    What was that?    I couldn't see it, but I couldsense it is far more powerful    than any Stand we've evercome across before.    It was like knowinga bulldozer is behind you    just from the sound of its engine.    I sensed it, too.That insane lust to k*ll us!    It felt like someone shovedan icicle straight up my ass!    If we hadn't escaped,we would've all been k*lled!    This is bad... This is really bad.    The sun's almost belowthe horizon!    Darkness is Dio's domain.He has the advantage now.    Don't tell me you're planningto retreat until dawn.    Listen, Mister Joestar!    I'm not running away nowwith my tail between my legs!    I'm with you, Polnareff.    Listen, I agree with both you.But the tables have turned on us.    We may've encounteredhis Stand, The World,    but we have no clueas to what it can do.    It's like climbing a mountain    without knowing the routeor knowing where the summit is.    Fighting him now would bea guaranteed disaster!    It's as inevitable as burpingafter drinking cola!    We know Dio will come after us!    He'll try to finish us offbefore sunrise!    In the meantime,    we can figure out the true extentof his Stand's powers.    We need to waitfor that opportunity.    No! I can't run!    Avdol and Iggy d*edbecause of me!    I'll fight dirty.    I'll go to Hell and back.I'll do whatever it takes to destroy Dio.    But I won't run away!    Wait, Polnareff!    Forget it, old man.It's no use when he's like this.    Jotaro, what do you thinkwe should do?    Polnareff is going after Dioto fight him.    We're retreating,but we'll also be fighting him.    Which means,    we'll att*ck from both sides.    Hey, you.    We want to buy your truck.Sell it to us.    What'd you say?This baby's my bread and butter!    What're you...    I'm flooring it, Kakyoin!    So, Dio, you finally show yourself!    Run away until dawn?Like hell I will!    I'll settle this on my own!    I don't know how Dio's Stand works,but it doesn't matter.    I'll find a way to defeat him!    I'll assassinate him!    Not so fast, Polnareff!    I told them we need to let you go    'cause it's no use tryingto convince stubborn guys like you.    But the old man and Kakyoininsisted I stick with you,    so here I am.    Jotaro!    Good grief.    THE WORLDDIO    Ah, the automobile...    Such impressive power and speed.    In my youth, all we had werehorse-drawn carriages.    Hold it right there!What do you think you're doing?    This car belongsto U.S. Senator Mr. Phillips!    Wanna puke out your eyes?    My, my... Young people these days.So full of piss and vinegar.    Ow!    Hold your tongue and proceedto the front seat. It's time to drive.    Who the hell are you?    Do you think you canget away with this?    That's right, this is unforgivable!    No one gets away with doingsomething like this to me.    I was valedictorianin high school and college!    I was captainof my college wrestling team!    Even after graduation,people respected me.    That's how I became a politician!    I'm owner of a villaon a thousand-acre plot of land in Hawaii!    My wife is a gorgeous modeltwenty-five years my junior!    I pay fifty times more taxesthan anyone in this town!    I destroyed every enemywho's every stood in my way!    And someday,I'll become president.    I'm Senator Phillips, dammit!    You listen to me, punk!    I'll make sure you rot in prison!    You hear me? You'll live the restof your life behind bars--    I'll say it one more time.    Drive.    What is this guy?He's going to k*ll me!    If I don't get out of here,he'll k*ll me!    Someone help--    What?    What?    I thought I jumped out of the car,so why...    Why am I back in the car?    Why am I back inside?    Catch up to that truck.    Fail and I'll k*ll you.    Yes, sir.    Why am I still inside? Why?    Ah, of course!It's because I'm a senator!    There's nothinga senator can't do!    I can still sense Dio's sinister,foreboding bloodlust.    He's after us.    I know he's following us!    Does Dio knowyour precise location?    No. He stole the bodyof my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar.    I can sense his body somehow,    but I can only tellthat he's close by.    I can't pinpointhis exact location.    The same wayI could tell he was in Cairo,    but I couldn't narrow downthe precise location of his lair.    All he knows isthat Jotaro and I are nearby.    But he can't tell the differencebetween us.    Most likely he hasn't realizedthat we've split up.    That's strange.    Cars always start upwhen they do this in the movies.    It's a traffic jam.    The evening commuteis always like this.    Keep going.    But there's nowhere to go.    There's plenty of roomon the sidewalk. Go.    The sidewalk?    It's covered with peopleheading home from work!    I don't care. Go.    Yes, sir!    -Step on it.-Yes, sir!    Okay, it's running.Get on, Polnareff.    Right...    See what I do for you!    You'll spare me...    You'll spare this senator's lifenow, won't you?    No.    That's it! This is a dream!    I'm a senator.There's no way I could die.    It's a dream! A dream! Hooray!    There they are.Catch up. Get closer.    I can't use The Worldunless I'm close to them.    He's getting closer.It's that car! Dio's in there!    Kakyoin!    Kakyoin's...    Take this, Dio! Emerald Splash!    Incredible!    He deflected my att*ckwith one finger.    And all while sittingperfectly still!    Then what about this?    I concentrated the Splash,but he still dodged it.    Damn!    When did he bring out his Stand?    How could I've missed that?    He's too far away.    He flew out of The World's range.    What's happening?    And what would I getby telling you?    Pay attention to the roadand drive.    Careful, Kakyoin!You're too close!    Forgive me. I didn't...    I remember a few months agowhen he said to me,    "Are you really goingto vomit out of fear?"    "Relax, Kakyoin, relax..."    Bastard! Never again!I won't lose again!    Kakyoin, are you all right?    Did you catch a glimpseof The World?    Yes. I att*cked himfrom around ten meters away.    If I had gotten any closer,I would have been done for.    It's clear his Stand holdsa power more horrific    than we could ever imagine.    We may not know its secret,but we do know two things:    First, his Stand can't reachas far as my Hierophant Green    or your Hermit Purple.    It's a close-range power Stand,like Star Platinum,    and has a rangeof about ten meters.    Second,it att*cked me with its fist,    so it doesn't useprojectile weapons like b*ll*ts.    If we can sneak up on himand get within ten meters,    we might have a chance.     We have to figure out his secret,but we also need to proceed carefully.    We can't betoo careful with Dio.    Something's up.His car stopped.    Watch out!Something's hurtling this way!    Mister Joestar!    What are you doing, Kakyoin?    I've got it.    I know how to find the secretof his Stand.    I wonder why I get goosebumpswhen I think about Avdol and Iggy.    Perhaps becausethey were the first friends    I shared a common goal with.    This journey to defeat Dio.    Show me your Stand, Dio!
02x46 - DIO's World, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 09:00What are you doing, Kakyoin?  I've got it.  I know how to find the secretof his Stand.  What?  For Noriaki Kakyoin,Hierophant Green is a reminder.  It's about Noriaki.  He makes no attempt to socializewith the other children.  It's not that he's disliked.  He seems rather reserved;too reserved, in fact.   As his teacher,I'm very concerned.   I'm ashamed to say,   but I'm afraidI don't understand it either.   It was always the same loop of thoughtsrunning through my head:   We all live in cities,and meet all sorts of people.   But how often do we makea genuine human connection?   All of my classmates'have address books   filled with their friends' names.   Each one of them must havea book of fifty,   maybe one hundred names.   Mom has dad, and dad has mom.   But I'm different.   I'm sure rock starsand TV celebrities   have tens of thousands of friends.   But I'm different.   I'll never have any friends.   No one will ever get me.No one can see Hierophant Green.   How can I relate to someonewho can't see the real me?   That's how I used to think.   Until I met Mr. Joestar, Jotaro,Polnareff, and Avdol.   Why does the mere thoughtof Avdol and Iggy   make the hairs on my backstand on end?   I know.It's because they're   the first peoplewho treated me like a friend.   Our goal to defeat Dio, together.   Our journeymay've been short-lived,   but we grew to be true friends.   For Noriaki Kakyoin,Hierophant Green was a revelation!   I'll make Hierophant Greenthe way it used to be.   Invisible to everyone!   I'll make Hierophant imperceptibleto reveal Dio's secret   before finishing him off for good!    EPISODE   : DIO'S WORLD, PART      Look, Jotaro!   The cars are totaled!   Up there.   The old man and Dio are upon the roof.   I see only Kakyoin and Josephbefore me.   Interesting.   They split up to att*ck mefrom both sides.   Jotaro and Polnareff must be comingafter me from behind.   Futile.   This is...   Kakyoin's Hierophant Green!   He turned it into a web?   -This is...-That's right!   The web fires on contact.   And it has you completely surroundedfor    meters in every direction!   I can sense youand your Stand's every move!   Take this, Dio!Twenty-meter radius Emerald Splash!   You fool. Find out for yourself.   The true power of The World   is the power to rule the world!   Show me your Stand, Dio!   The World!   What? Kakyoin!   Something just sent himhurtling through the air!   But how?   Kakyoin!   What just happened?   Did he get me?   It's no use. It must be fatal.   I can't speakor even move my finger.   It's  :  .   And midnight in Japan.   I wonder what mom and dadare doing.   I suppose they're already asleep.   I'm sorry for causing youso much worry.   Noriaki Kakyoin's last thoughts were notof his parents back in Japan.   Now his parental musingshad given way to the single question   that bewildered himmore than any other.   I can sense any movementwithin Hierophant Green's web.   But Dio managed to breakthe entire web in one moment.   Not one strand at a time,   but all of them at once.   Without even a ten-thousandthof a second difference.   How did he instantaneously shatteran entire   -meter-radius area?   How?   Not even a slight delay...   How all at once?   How?   Kakyoin!   Enough! Hermit...   Joseph, you're next.   For Jonathan's body to finallybecome completely mine,   I must drink the bloodof a Joestar.   Now's as good a time as any,don't you think?   Dio!   Why all at once?Without the slightest delay in time...   Time...    Time...    The time!    I got it.    How could this be?There's no other explanation.    I have to tellthe others somehow!    The disturbing realitybehind his ability.    I have to tell Mr. Joestar.    Otherwise, everyone will...    die.    You're not getting away with this!    I'll take that body back,for Granny Erina!    Erina? That country bumpkin?    Nonsense.    I predict I drink all of your blood.Then you die.    Joseph Joestar!    Die!    My last Emerald Splash...    A final pointless att*ck?    Behold, a "hero"in the throes of death...    I suppose that washis last pathetic attempt    to make his mark on the world.    No!    Kakyoin would neverjust throw in the towel    with some meaningless att*ck.    Why did he strike the clock?    What does it mean?    Was he trying to tell me something?    It's a message.    I have nothing left...    Mister Joestar...    You must understand.    You must tell the others.    Kakyoin!    Noriaki Kakyoind*ed that moment.     NORIAKI KAKYOINDECEASED    Hermit Purple!    Prepare yourself, Dio!    Hamon of the Sun!    You senile old fool!Your Stand is the weakest of all!    You're not escaping me!    Kakyoin,why did you destroy the clock?    You were tryingto tell me something    by aiming for the clock tower,weren't you?    It must mean something!    It's Mr. Joestar!    And Dio's chasing him.    Where's Kakyoin?    Did you, Kakyoin,    in the face of death,figure out the secret of his Stand?    Destroying the clockwith Emerald Splash.    Destroying the clock's hands.    Stopping the clock.    Impossible! Dio's Stand...    The power of The World...    It can stop time!    Take this, Dio!Twenty-meter radius Emerald Splash!    The World!    Behold The World.    Since time is stopped for you,you likely see and feel nothing.    Die, Kakyoin!    You don't even knowyou're about to die.    You have no knowledgeof what has just occurred.    I got it, Kakyoin!    Your dying message... I got it!     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    A Stand that can freeze time?    Freeze time and still move freelywithin space?    That's unbelievable!    A Stand like that,can anyone b*at it?    Calm down and think!    The word "panic"isn't in my vocabulary.    I will find a way...    I will find a way to defeat him!    He's gone!    What's the matter?    Aren't you going to hit me, Dio?    I thought you were goingto drink my blood.    So you're running Hamon throughyour body to protect yourself.    You've wrapped your bodywith Hamon-infused Hermit Purple,    like a cloak of high-voltage wires.    Very resourceful.Truly a geriatric genius.    Same to you.    You figured out I was using Hamonand made sure not to touch me.    Perceptive son of a...    But I figured one thing outabout your Stand.    You can stop time,but only for a short while.    Only about three to four seconds,I'd say.    If you could stop time longer,    you would've already k*lled usback at your mansion,    and you wouldn't have hadto come after us.    So you understandThe World's ability?    Kudos, Joseph.    It was Kakyoin who figured it out.    Kakyoin didn't die in vain!    And so what?    So what if you know my ability?    What can your pathetic Hamon do?    -Hermit Purple and Hamon!-Enough!    I can k*ll you without touchingthe Hamon!    Hey, look.    Some old man fell out of the sky!    I bet he's Santa Claus!    What were you doing on the roof?    Looking for pretty girls below?    Old man!    Jotaro! Stay back!    Don't come near me!    Jotaro... Such good timing.    But he's still out of my range.    I'll finish Joseph off first.    Jotaro! The World controls time!    It's a Stand that can stop ti--    The World!    In the beginning, I could stop timeonly long enough to blink.    But as my neck began to heal,    I was able to stop timefor two seconds, then three.    Now I can stop timefor as long as five seconds.    Then again, time is stopped,    so all I can say is that it feelslike five seconds.    Soon I'll be able to stop timefor one minute...    Then ten minutes, an hour...    And later, as long as I desire!    How fun it will be.    Being able to stop timeto my heart's content...    Oh, I almost forgot.    Joseph's protecting his bodywith Hamon.    Hamon was a thorn in my sideone hundred years ago,    but it's powerlessagainst The World.    Futile!    Joseph, grandson of Jonathan,    you're dead!    One...    Zero.    THE WORLDDIO    Old man!    Stay back! Run... Jotaro...    Don't get near him.    Keep your...    distance...    Stay away from him...    He's... invincible...    I've already taken care of Kakyoin.    Polnareff must be hiding somewhere.    But it doesn't matter.    You're next, Jotaro!    You bastard.    Dio!    Oh? So you want to fight?    Instead of running,you're moving in closer.    How ungrateful. And afteryour dear grandfather, Joseph,    gave his life to tell youthe power of The World.    He was so desperate,like a pathetic student struggling    to fill in the last few answers of a testas the final seconds tick by...    I can't b*at you to a pulpfrom far away.    Oh, then approach as you must.    You're slow! The Worldis the most powerful Stand.    The World's speed and powerfar outmatches your Star Platinum,    regardlessof its time-stopping ability.    Your Stand is similarto my Star Platinum.    We don't have long range,    but we have incrediblepower and precision.    I always wanted to seehow much stronger    The World is than Star Platinum.    Though it seems pointlesseven to compare.    You wanted to compare?    All you didwas pat me on the leg.    Well, I guess you did ripmy   ,   -yen pants, though.    Why are you Joestars so stubborn?    You can never admit defeat,can you?    Fine, I'll accept your provocationand resume our comparison.    A comparison of punching speed, eh?    Futile!    I first experienced stopped timehalf a year ago.    It began when everything around meseemed to have stopped.    It will be The World's true powerthat deals the final blow!    The World, stop time!
02x47 - DIO's World, Part 3QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 09:00Futile!  Futile!  So I was right.  The World's speed and powerfar exceeds anything  in your pathetic repertoire of tricks!  Enough play. I am content.  I will finish you with a single blow!  I swore I would never againshow mercy  to any descendant of the Joestars.You must all die swiftly!   The World's true powerwill finish you for all eternity!   The World! Stop time!   The World!   Futile!    EPISODE   : DIO'S WORLD, PART     And now, the Joestar line ends here.   Oh, perennial nemesisand fateful burden...   I bid thee farewell!   Wha...   What?   He just moved!   He... Impossible!   His finger just moved!   Could it be?   They're the same?   It's the same type of Standas Star Platinum.   The World and Star Platinumare the same type of Stand?   Jotaro, can you see me?   Or are you movingyour hand unconsciously?   Time's up.   Could you see me?   I asked if you could see me, Jotaro!   See what?   I don't knowwhat you're talking about, Dio.   Fine! Have it your way!   When time is standing still,your ability to see me is irrelevant!   If you can move like The World does,   then show me!   The first time I managedto stop time was six months ago.   To test my Stand's power and speed,   I ordered my servant to firehis shotgun in my direction.   As I reached to grab a b*llet,   for a split second,it looked as if time had stood still.   That's when it all began.   Perhaps I was seeing things, I thought.   Is this the sensationof an elite boxer witnessing   his opponent's puncheslingering in midair?   Has my sense of time slowed,like a victim watching   his fate unfold moments whena second feels like an eternity.   But my Stand, The World,was able to move between   the hovering b*ll*tssuspended in time...   and grasp them!   It was no illusion!   Lord Dio!   One day,you will dominate time!   You must believe that   you can move amid the realmof frozen time!   It must be like breathing.   Or like snapping an HB pencilbetween your fingers!   You must believeit's completely ordinary.   What's important is thatyou believe you can do it.   You must have the mental fortitudeto push aside your doubts!   You are the ruler of this world!   Controlling time is second nature!   Then one day,   I sensed the wheels of timeand The World interlock.   Like a ray of light dispersingthe shadows,   a revelation befell me.My mind was never clearer.   I, Dio, have surpassedall living things, all Stand users!   Now I can stop timefor five seconds.   And day by day,that time will grow longer!   Jotaro!   Now I shall seejust how powerful you truly are!   The World! Stop time!   You planted a magnet on me.   He must have attached it to my sleevewhen we were exchanging blows.   It looks like a wallet magnetor a magnet from a pocket planner.   You had me fooled.   Very clever indeed.   But...   a trick like this just proves   you can't move while timeis standing still!   You only postponed your deathby a few seconds!   This time, you will...   die, Jotaro!   What?   He... can really move!   Only momentarily, but he can!   The magnet wasn't soI would think he could move...   It was so I would think he couldn't move!It was a trick to lure me in!   You must believeit's completely ordinary!   To think that one of the Joestarscould inv*de my domain...   It is infuriating!   I was able to move for a second...Just a second.   But...   Good grief.   Just enough time for one punch.   You. Woman.   Go fetch me my leg.   Bring it to me now!    Imagine you're a flight attendantbringing wine and caviar    to a passenger in first class!    But it seemsI'll have to blow your head off    to do any real damage.    Looks like you've already recovered.    That gaping hole I opened inyour gut has healed over.    Your eyes followed mewhile time was at a standstill.    You can see me moving,can you, Jotaro?    Thanks to him.    Kakyoin did you quite the favor.    Because he figured outThe World's secret,    you knew I can stop time,    and then you learned how to do it.    Which makes me wonder...    Exactly how long can you movewhile time is frozen?    Two seconds? Three?    Or perhaps, like me,you can move five seconds,    but you're just pretendingthat you can't move longer?    Well?    This isn't good.    I could probably move longerwith some practice,    but right now,the best I can do is a second.    I speculate you can movefor only a single second.    Still, you have managedto infiltrate my world.    Only a fool would riskapproaching you now.    My advantage over youis overwhelming, yes, but...    Jotaro, I've devised a wayto execute you    regardless of how longyou can move!    You've grown pale.    These knives must bringback memories, no?    You know you're goingto die a death    even more terrible thanthat pathetic old man Joseph.    Bastard!    How the hell does he come upwith stuff like this?    This is really bad.    You can't escape!    The World!    Five seconds!    Once time resumes,    can your Star Platinum reallydeflect all of the knives?    Four seconds!    It must be terrifyingto helplessly gaze upon    the agent of your imminent death!    Three seconds.    Just two more seconds.Is that all you can do?    That is the proofof your short-lived abilities.    One second.    Zero.    It's over.    And one more just in case.    To be frank,    I'm relieved that I could defeat youso quickly, Jotaro.    I never would have thoughtyou would infiltrate my perfect world.    I suppose a fitting analogy isthe automobile.    Those moving machines are useful,    but only when the roadsare not clogged with them.    The master of time must be me,and me alone.    Good grief.    Throw enough knives?    He had to go and turn my favorite uniforminto Swiss cheese.    Glad I stuffed my clotheswith magazines.    I figured he'd try throwingsomething at me    but that many was a surprise.    My best bet now is to play possum    and wait for a chance to strike.    I've got to smash his head inand destroy his brains    or he'll never die.    As they say,one can never be too careful.    The Joestars have always enjoyeduncommonly auspicious luck.    He may very well be playing dead.    I have to make surehe is completely devoid of life!    I'll use this...    to chop off his head!    Prepare for your final blow...    Jotaro!    Die, Dio!    Polnareff!    The World!Time is stopped.    So it's you, Polnareff?    And time resumes.    Such a shame, Polnareff.    Just a split second more,    and with just a bit more oomph,    you could have jostled my braininto a mess of scrambled eggs.    Bastard! This can't be...    It's impossible to k*ll me.    After I'm through with you,    Joestar's Merry Tour of Egyptwill come to a tragic end.    Damn it.    At this rate,Polnareff's going to end up dead.    I was going to play deaduntil the last moment possible    before landing a critical blowto his cranium, but...    saving Polnareff would be easy.    But he won't come within rangeof Star Platinum.    It'll end up just like last time.    I can't let him know I'm alive.    As long as he thinks I'm dead,    I'll still have a chanceto get close to him.    It's kind of twisted.    One minute I'm trying to movewhile time has stopped,    and the nextI'm trying to stay completely still.    Farewell, Polnareff!    Jotaro...    Is he aliveor is he regaining consciousness?    Freeze! Police!    Try anything and we'll sh**t!    Now put up your hands slowly.    Ah, what perfect timing.    There's someone I'd like you to sh**t.    It's that man lying over there.    sh**t his leg, his torso,whatever you please.    Come on. Be sure you hit him.    I thought I heard Jotaromake a sound    or was it my imagination?    That sick bastard...    But now his attention is on me,not Polnareff.    He's more than suspicious.    Now he's gonna makedoubly sure I'm dead.    It's only going to get worsefrom here.    Is he breathing?    No, I don't hear respiration.He's not breathing.    Then a heartbeat?    sh*t, this hurts like a...    If I black out,I'll never come back.    If I die because I usedmy Stand to stop my heart,    now that's sick irony...    No heartbeat.He really is dead.    His being alive was justa figment of my imagination.    I'd better behead himfor peace of mind, just in case.    You won't mind right, Jotaro?    What?    Stop time!    The World!    You put me through hell back there.    I'll be damned if I let you tryto stop the clock again,    let alone escape withyour skull intact... Dio.    What? It can't be...    Finally...    Finally, I got to run my fistinto his skull.    But that shithead Dio    lived at the bottom of the seafor over a century.    I can't be surethat bastard's croaked.    This is no time to celebrate.    I'll m*rder you.    What? But how?No! My legs...    I can't move my legs.    I can't stand up!     My head! The excruciating pain...I think I'm going to vomit.     How could this happen?Me, Dio, feel sick?     He damaged my brain.I can't move my legs!    Blast it! I've got to...     I've doused you with gasolineso I can sniff you out.     I hate to kick a guywhen he's down, but...     well, actually I don't give a damn.     It's because of youthat my friends     and countless innocent bystandersare dead.    The World!    If I can...    If I can just make it there...    And now, time will start again.     He had his earto the ground listening for cars.    But...    I can't let him get away!    Just a little farther!    I'm almost there.    Sorry, spot's taken.You're not getting away.    Give it up, Dio.    The World!    You fell for it, Jotaro!    This is my escape route!    I, Dio, have outsmarted you!    Doesn't this street look familiar?    This street... It can't be...    That's right.    My escape route is to drink the bloodof your grandfather, Joseph Joestar!    Dio, you bastard!    Jotaro...    This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?    Joestar blood suits me so well!    This is the greatest high!    There's one simple answer.    You're going to...
02x48 - Long Journey Farewell, My FriendsQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 09:01As I expected...  Joseph's blood suits me well.  It feels absolutely perfectin this body,  so much richer and rejuvenatingthan that which came before!  It feels so good...  So incredibly good!  One hundred years ago, this bodybelonged to Jonathan Joestar.  And now, with these very hands,  I have feasted on the bloodof his grandson, Joseph!   And you are the one who hasso thoughtfully led me here, Jotaro.   The Joestar family has always beenan unsightly nuisance to me,   like the roadside excrement leftby some mangy mutt.   In the end,   it appears that the Joestarsare fated to serve me.   Old man...   Old man.   From here on...   No matter what Dio triesto do to my body,   never lose your cool.Never succumb to rage, Jotaro.   Don't worry about me.   It was meant to be.   Could that bethe old man's soul?   Kakyoin solved the secretbehind Dio's Stand.   And I passed it on to you.   If we had all fought Dio togetherin one single moment,   none of us would be alive.   You've learned to movewhile time is frozen.   You have two or three seconds now.   Use that time wisely.   No matter what Dio does,don't lose your head.   It'll only backfire if you loseself-control and att*ck.   Jotaro...   What a journey it's been.   My boy, we had quitethe adventure.   These last fifty days.   We managed to have our fun,didn't we?   Call me crazy,but I've never had more fun in my life.   Was I seeing things?   Hey!   What are you looking at, Jotaro?   You damn bastard.   I've sucked him dry!   Old man, I know you told meto keep my cool.   But he just crossed the line.   There's not a man on earthwho could stay calm after seeing that!   This is the final round!   The World!   Futile!    EPISODE   : LONG JOURNEYFAREWELL, MY FRIENDS    The World! Stop time!   Wry!   One second! Two seconds.   Three seconds! Four...   Five seconds.   Six seconds.   Seven seconds!   I can feel it!I have power to spare!   I can still stop time!   But you, Jotaro,   I know you can't move any longer.   So you gambledon getting me two seconds   before time resumed, huh?   You've miscalculated.   I feel invigorated!   I could sing!   Eight seconds!   I've been immortalfor an entire century,   but I've never felt so good!   The blood of the Joestars surgesthrough my vines!   This is the greatest high knownto man!   Old man,guess you were right.   My temper just got mein a whole mess of trouble.   But you know what?   He still hasn't feltthe full brunt of my rage!   Nine seconds!   I was able to stop timefor nine seconds!   Perhaps this is my limit.   You bastard!   Now to unleashall of my Stand's power!   Jotaro! You mumbled somethingabout being angry.   Is this all you've got?   Futile!   And now, without further ado,the k*lling blow!   This is the ultimate,my final dance with time!   In the next nine seconds,while time is suspended,   you shall die!   The World!   One second.   Two seconds.   Three seconds.   Jotaro had no idea.He didn't understand why Dio   had disappeared amidstthe standstill of time.   Four seconds.   Jotaro gave up pondering.   No matter what Dio's plans,   no matter what att*ckhe attempts to unleash,   Jotaro had only two secondsto respond.   Only two seconds to driveStar Platinum's fists into Dio,   once and for all!    Five seconds.    All I know is that the next timeI see that god damned face,    I'm gonna freakin lose it!    Six seconds.    Bring it, Dio!    Seven seconds.    Take this steam roller!    It's too late!It's impossible escape!    Futile!    Futile!    Eight seconds!    I'll obliterate you!    Nine seconds.    I did it.    It's over.    The World has defeatedStar Platinum!    I am immortal!I am everlasting!    Stand power!    This proves that no one isstronger than me, Dio!    Pathetic humans!I shall rule over all of you forever!    Bow before my wisdom and power!    Ten seconds!    And with that,I can stop time for ten seconds!    Now, then...    I suppose I should inspect Jotaro'slifeless body and drink his blood.    If there's any blood left to savor!    What?    My body's slowing down.    No... I'm not slowing down.    I can't move. No!    My body won't move at all!    Dio!    It's been eleven seconds.    Guess that's your limit.    What?    I stopped time at nine seconds.    And got outfrom beneath that roller.    Good grief.    Now...    It won't take even a secondto finish you off!    Jotaro!    THE WORLDDIO    This can't be happening!You stopped time?    You waited for me to use upmy nine seconds.    How does it feel, Dio?    Having your archenemy tower behind youwhile you stand frozen and helpless?    I guess it's kinda like underwater divingwhile holding your breath.    Your air runs out, you swimto the surface, desperate for air...    And when you finally make itto the water's edge,    ready to take a gulpof that glorious, fresh air,    you feel a tug,and are yanked back down into the deep.    Sound about right?    But I don't feel sorryfor you at all.    Time is moving again.    Compassion is somethingyou'll never get from me.    I have zero sympathyfor your sorry ass.    Then again,k*lling you while you're helpless    would leave a bad tastein my mouth.    How long will it takefor you to heal?    Three seconds? Four seconds?    The second your legsare ready for action,    Star Platinum will smash your headall over the pavement.    Bring it!    If this were the Wild West,this is when the hero would say...    "Draw! You've got one sh*t."    How dare...    he mock me?    Oh... But Jotaro,    at this eleventh hour,    you can't help but uttersuch a human declaration.    You think like a true mortal,cursed with a fleeting life.    A bad taste in your mouth?    Are you afraid you'd regret it?    Your reasoning is as pathetic as    a rat dropping in the cornerof a bathroom stall.    Your foolish honorwill be your demise!    I, on the other hand,think differently.    All I have on my mindis one simple goal.    Just one!    To dominate! Nothing more.    That is my fulfillment!    How I do it...    doesn't matter!    How'd you like a little bloodin your eyes?    I win! Die!    Wha...    What?    Impossible! I'm Dio!    I'm Dio!    When the sun rises,you'll return to dust.    You made one mistake, Dio.    Just one mistake.    You pissed me off.     DIO... THE WORLDANNIHILATED. DECEASED    This is Speed WagonFoundation Car Two.    We're traveling northbound onthe Al-Nil Expressway.    And we've retrieved Dio's remains.    I repeat.We've retrieved Dio's remains.    Dio's body is showingcellular activity.    He must be exposed to sunlightas soon as possible.    Proceed with extreme caution!    Take every precaution necessary.    Roger.    Noriaki Kakyoin is dead.    We are transporting his bodyvia helicopter.    Jean Pierre Polnareffis unconscious.    The medical staff of Car Onehas taken him into their care.    Roger.    Car Two, I have a question...    Why have you placedthe remains of Dio    and Joseph Joestarinto the same car?    Because it's not over.    -Dio borrowed something from us.-Huh?    And we need it back.    I'm afraid I don't follow.    A blood transfusion betweenthe two bodies, can you do it?    Are you suggestingwe transfuse Dio's blood    into Mr. Joestar's corpse?    To bring Mr. Joestar back to life?    Dio drained his bloodonly minutes ago.    Dio's upper half is gone,but we'll take what we can.    I think we can still make it.    Did you hear that? Over.    Roger...    It's impossible!He doesn't have a pulse.    His heart has stopped.    We can't circulate his bloodwithout a working heart!    Impossible?    Just about everythingon this journey has been impossible.    I'm sick of hearing wordslike "impossible" or "futile."    They mean nothing to us.    You said you can do itif his heart's b*ating, right?    Well, you're in luck.    Thanks to Dio,    I've already had some practicewith stopping and starting hearts.    I hear a pulse!    His heart's b*ating!    Hurry! Extract the bloodfrom Dio's corpse    and transfuse it to Joseph!    This just might work!    Look!    His skin is regaining its color!    His lifeless flesh is softeningand filling out!    Brain activity!We have brain activity!    I don't believe it!His vitals are good!    His eyes! He opened his eyes!    We did it! He's back!    Old man?    You're a fool, Jotaro!    Don't freakin tell me...    You've single-handedlyresurrected yours truly!    You bastard!    Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding!Kidding! I'm just kidding!    Just kidding! It was a joke!    I'm sorry!I was just messing with you.    I swear it's me!    Joseph Joestar.Born September   th,     .    Wife's Suzie Q.I collect comics as a hobby!    Who's the leading actressin the      film Tarzan, the Ape Man?    Bo Derek.    Who sang "Eat It",the spoof of "b*at It"?    "Weird Al" Yankovic.    Good grief. I guess it is you.    Only you would knowpointless crap like that.    This is Car Two. It's unbelievable!    Mr. Joestar is awake!    Mr. Joestar has come backfrom the brink!    It's a miracle! Over!    We've taken back what's ours,    Dio.    It's over.     Dio took something from all of us.     For the past hundred years,    he's taken whatever he wanted.    He's taken far too much.     Yeah.Things we can never get back.    The loss is as vast as this planet.    But thanks to their sacrifices,    we stand here today.    Kakyoin.    Iggy.    Avdol.    It's over.    So you're really going backto France, huh, Polnareff?    But your family's gone.     Why don't you come staywith us in New York?    Mister Joestar, they may be gone,but France is my home.    It's filled with my memories.    It's a placeI must always return to.     If you ever need anything, call me.     I'll find you, wherever you may be.    We're gonna miss you.    It sure wasn't easy,    but I had one hell of a time.    Thanks to you guys.    Yeah.    We're a team.We'll always be.    Calling passengersof France International Airlines    Flight    to Paris,    please proceed to Gate   .    See you, you old bastard!    I wish you a long, long life!    And you, his stingy grandson!You'd better not forget about me!    We'll meet again!    That is, if you don't hate me by then,you stubborn jack ass!    We couldn't forget if we tried.    Take care of yourself.    So long, friends.    -Yeah.-So long.    Holly...     Why did you wake up all of a sudden?What happened?    I feel so much better!    Like we could readeach other's minds.    -What?-They're both coming home, mom!    Holly!    Dad and Jotaro!    They're coming home!

It won't turn off.Red: Looks like Jotaro Kujo's not leaving town...Red: Even though I warned him all those times.Red: Well, what's the deal, Josuke Higashikata?Josu: You're...Josu: Chili Pepper?!Title: JoJo's Bizarre AdventureTitle: Diamond is UnbreakableTitle: Episode   Chili Pepper, Part Josu: Why'd you come here?Red: Don't ask that now.Red: I've been stopping by here every now and then for a while now.Josu: What?Josu: So this villain's been watching me for a long time?Red: I've been frequently going to visit Okuyasu,Red: the younger brother of Keicho,whom I got rid of,main: ,and I'm very familiar with Koichi Hirose's Reverb and Yukako Yamagishi, as well.Red: And I know that Toshikazu Hazamadamain: ,and Tamami Kobayashi are both in the hospital.Josu: What I'm asking you is what are you actually doing in front of me,main: ,when all this time you've been sneaking around like a gutless coward?Josu: I doubt this is it,main: ,but you're not foolish enough to actually think you're going to kick my ass, are you?Red: Kick your ass?main: ,I'd never do anything that awful to you.Red: I'm here to k*ll you painlessly.Josu: I just can't laugh at your sad excuse for a joke,Josu: good sir.Red: I told Jotaro this before, but Jotaro's Star Platinum is a menace to me.Red: It's the fact that Jotaro is too attentivemain: ,and the fact that Star Platinum has the power to stop time.Red: So I just wanted to see just how much stronger my Stand has gotten over time.Red: Before I fight Jotaro,main: ,I thought I'd test myself against you, Josuke Higashikata.Red: Come a bit closer.Red: Closer! Until you can att*ck as quickly and precisely as Star Platinum, Josuke!Red: Come on! If you're that far away, your punches will be too weak.Josu: Are you mocking me?Red: Of course not.main: ,I've just seen through your abilities.Red: Come closer and give me a super sharp one.Red: Here. Hit me right here. Come on. Come closer!Gush,Sfx: cr*ck!Red: Huh? H-He's fast...Josu: Quit your daydreaming!Red: Much faster than I thought!Josu: If you want to keep daydreaming,Josu: maybe I'll just help you sleep!Josu: Listen up! Jotaro's Star Platinum is nothing like this!Red: I regret my actions.internal/narrator: ,I got a little cocky and underestimated him.Spark: What?!Mom: Josuke! What is all that noise?Josu: What was that Stand power?It felt like a jet engine going off...Josu: He might just be stronger than Jotaro...Red: You, too, Josuke.main: ,Your Shining Diamond surprised me.Red: Looks like I'm not the only one that's grown.Red: I'll wait a little longer.Red: Until my Chili Pepper grows stronger, I won't be able to defeat Jotaro.Josu: He can show up anywhere there's electricity.Josu: Not only does he have tremendous power, but he can control his Stand remotely.Mom: Josuke, I just asked you what all that noise was!Josu: It's nothing.Oku: Man, a bug totally just bit me.Oku: ! Bugs only come to me.Koi: Ah, Josuke!Josu: Sorry to keep you guys waiting.Oku: What did you want to talk about, Josuke?Oku: Why call us out to a lonely-looking place like this?Oku: Couldn't we go to Tonio's or the usual café?Josu: I'm not the one who called you guys out here. It was Jotaro.Koi: Jotaro did? I wonder what he wants.Josu: It's probably about Chili Pepper.Koi: What?! Chili Pepper?main: ,You mean the Stand, Chili Pepper?!Oku: So he appeared?Josu: Yeah, he did. At my place last night.Oku: You! Why didn't you let me know right away?!Koi: Okuyasu... He acts completely different when it comes to Chili Pepper.Koi: I can't blame him, since thatStand k*lled his brother, but...Jojo: I told Josuke to keep quiet.Jojo: Talking about him in the city, where there's electricity running, is dangerous.Koi: Jotaro!Jojo: I had you all come to this field so he wouldn't hear us talking.Josu: Okuyasu, Chili Pepper totally pisses me off, too.Josu: He got into my house without me knowing.Josu: He's free to listen to us talking and take whatever he wants.Koi: Come to think of it, the homework I finishedmain: ,the other day disappeared from my desk!Koi: And I thought my mom mistook it for trash—Josu: That's not a big deal, Koichi!Josu: What I'm trying to say is that the only reasonmain: ,Chili Pepper hasn't caused more trouble is that we're around,Josu: and he drags people who piss him off into the phone linesJosu: with about as much effort as someone making a pervy phone call.Josu: Of course, he can use the bow and arrow,main: ,and he may have already used it on someone.Josu: I saw first-hand that he's gotten stronger.Josu: We have to hurry up and find out who his user is.Koi: B-But how?Josu: We all gathered here to figure that out, right, Jotaro?Jojo: No, not quite.Jojo: We'll be able to find him.Jojo: Because the person who's capablemain: ,of finding him is arriving at Morioh Port at noon.Koi: Huh?Oku: Someone who can find him?Josu: Is he a Stand user?!Jojo: That's right.Jojo: His Stand's name is Hermit Purple.Jojo: Only he's gotten way too old, so he doesn't have the strength to fight.Josu: Too old? How old is this guy?main: ,Do you know him, Jotaro?Jojo: Yeah. I know him very well.main: ,He used to be pretty ripped,Jojo: though you wouldn't guess that now.Jojo: He's ... No, maybe he's ...Josu: ?! He's super old!Jojo: Well, his legs are weak, so he's using a cane.Jojo: He had surgery to remove gallstones two years ago,main: ,and suffered from cataracts.Jojo: He wears full denturesmain: ,and complains that he can't eat T-bone steaks.Jojo: He's also starting to forget things.Josu: Hey, come on, now.main: ,You're not gonna tell me his hobby is talking to mailboxes, are you?Josu: Give me a break!Jojo: I had you guys gather here in order to protect that old man.Jojo: If Chili Pepper finds out about him,he's probably going to k*ll him.Jojo: Because the thing Chili Pepper fears most is us finding out who his user is.Josu: Yeah, but is a man like that really going to be useful to us?Jojo: I tried to stop him,main: ,but when he heard about the bow and arrow, he came to Japan on his own.Koi: Came to Japan? Is he a foreigner, Jotaro?Jojo: Yeah.Koi: Josuke, th-this is serious!Josu: Huh? What is?Koi: Josuke! If he's , a foreigner, and a Stand user...Josu: Y-You can't mean...Red: I heard you loud and clear.Oku: Chili Pepper!Jojo: Impossible! How'd he get to this field?Morioh_Landmark_,Sign: Morioh Landmark #Morioh Grand HotelHow to get there: From bus stop #,take the bus for "Morioh GrandSwimming Area" and get off at the"Morioh Grand Hotel" stop.From there, it's a -minute walk.Located in the same area as manyexpensive villas, it's an elegant hotel full of history. It has housed various travelers to Morioh and has been beloved for years. The beef tongue served at the hotel restaurant is considered superb and is the talk of the town.Whew,Sfx: RumbleKoi: Why?! There aren't any electrical lines here, so how?!Jojo: The bike's battery.Jojo: ! He must have hidden in the bike's battery and followed us here.Oku: In my bike?Josu: He heard us!Red: The port at noon?Red: An old man Stand user who can find me?Whew,Sfx: RumbleRed: I'll be sure to k*ll that man the moment he arrives at the port!Jojo: Now he knows about the old man...Jojo: In other words, Josuke's father.Whew,Sfx: RumbleJojo: This isn't good.Jojo: If we let him go, he's gonna get to the old man before we do.Koi: Josuke! We need to throw a rock at that bike and destroy it!Oku: No, hold up.Oku: For the sake of revenge, I, Okuyasu Nijimura,Oku: will k*ll that villain!Koi: He cut through space-time!Red: Ack! Keicho's younger brother!Oku: I'm the one who's going to deal with you.Oku: I'll scrape you away!Red: Okuyasu, I compliment you,Red: at least in regards to you instantly transferring over here.Red: But the scratching motion you do with your The HandRed: seems to stand no chance against Chili Pepper's swiftness.Red: You're too slow!Oku: Take a better look, you foolishass.Oku: When I said I'll scrape you away,Oku: I meant the bike.Red: The bike's front wheel!Oku: Now you won't be able to run away.Josu: You actually used your head,Okuyasu. Good job!Josu: Chili Pepper can't go far from the bike's battery.Josu: Which means... Look!Josu: The nearest electrical line is at least a hundred meters away,Josu: so you're as good as caught!Koi: That was close!Jojo: No, we haven't actually caught him yet.Jojo: The bike battery is still there.Jojo: I'm sure he plans to do whatever he can to k*ll Okuyasu and run.Jojo: We're going, too!Josu: Right!Koi: Right!Red: Do you really think you've trapped me?Red: Are you trying to get revenge for Keicho?Oku: No.Oku: My Big BroOku: deserved to die.Oku: I knew that someone would k*ll him someday.Oku: The thing about crimes...Oku: When you keep doing stuff like that,Oku: somewhere, somehow, it's going to come back and get you.Oku: Even I can figure that out.Oku: If you tell meOku: your user's name and address,Oku: I'll spare your life.Red: If I tell you, you'll spare my life?Red: You're calmer than I thought.Red: I thought your insides were boiling from wanting revenge so badly.Oku: Deep down inside, I hope you don't tell me!Ou: I'm dying to scrape you away so bad, you foolishass!Red: I knew it.Red: But you want to scrape me away?Red: With that pathetically slow right hand?Red: Should I laugh, or should I yawn?Red: It's a tough choice!Oku: You!Oku: I'll k*ll you!Red: I'll make sure you know wellRed: just how slow your Stand is!Red: Do you see now? It's this slow!Josu: Okuyasu!Koi: Okuyasu!Rd: !Rd: Here comes Jotaro...Red: I can't stick around here for long.Red: What?! He's behind me?!Oku: I may have missed, but I still scraped through space-time,Oky: so I could instantly transfer.Oku: Did you forget?Oku: I've got you now!Oku: You little !Oku: Looks like you're getting quite a bit slower.Oku: Are you going to be able to escape the next att*ck?Koi: Look! Chili Pepper's electrical sparkle is fading!Koi: He's getting weaker!Koi: His Stand power must be running out!Josu: Does this mean Okuyasu wins?Jojo: Okuyasu! Don't finish him off yet!Jojo: Wait until we get there.Jojo: You've won!main: ,We have to ask him where the bow and arrow are right now.Red: You're right... I'm weakening.Red: Your Stand's right hand is slow as hell,but it's still a terrifying Stand.Red: But...Red: Are you sure you don't want to finish me off?Red: Maybe I'm just acting like I've grown weak, Okuyasu.Oku: What?!Red: Maybe I'm waiting for Jotaro to get closer so I can chop his head off.Oku: What are you talking about?Red: Oh, nothing.Red: What will you do? Finish me off now,Red: or wait for Jotaro to get here?Oku: You...Oku: But wait. Why would you tell me that?Oku: If he hadn't told me he was acting weaker,internal/narrator: ,he could have tricked me, and beatenme and Josuke by playing dirty...Oku: Which means, uh, since he told me he's fine,internal/narrator: ,my chance of getting att*cked is zero, right?Ku: You're telling me to finish you off?!Do you want to die?Red: I'll leave that up to you.Oku: Is he really weaker?internal/narrator: ,Or is he lying about being weaker,and he's actually fine?Okku: Which is the truth?Red: Are you coming or aren't you?Oku: If he's fine, I need to go in to finish him.Oku: It's possible he's got something up his sleeve, too.Oku: Should I?Jojo: Okuyasu... Something's wrong.Red: Hurry up and make up your mind, Okuyasu.Oku: !Oku: I can't be bothered to think aboutwhich is right anymore, !Jojo: Okuyasu!Oku: Don't try and stop me, Jotaro!Oku: He k*lled my big bro!I'm going to finish this!Oku: That's the only truth inside my heart!Oku: Die, you little !Gush - Copy,Sfx: GaonJosu: Just great. Now finding the bowand arrow is going to be a real pain.Josu: Though it looks like things were settled.Jojo: No, something is wrong.main: ,It looks like Chili Pepper really was plotting something.Both: Huh?!Oku: There were electrical cables underground?Oku: That one! He wanted me to dig this up!Red: I really was weakened.Red: The bike's battery is only a -volt.Red: That was close!Oku: Why, you...Red: Thanks to you, I feel alive again!Red: Okuyasu!Red: If you had only been a good little boyRed: and held back like Jotaro told you,main: ,the battery would have d*ed, and I would've been eliminated.Oku: Wha...Red: I know where all of the electrical lines in this city are.Red: I thought about running away using those cables,Red: but they were far from the bike.Red: I didn't have the power to dig up the cables.Oku: You!Oku: He's even more...Red: Which means the electricity from earlier, the electrical power,Red: is on my side.Whew - Copy,Sfx: BogoKoi: Okuyasu!Red: Your big brother Keicho said you held him back.Red: He was right.Red: Your mind is underdeveloped.Red: You never could have gotten revenge, you foolishass!Red: Bye-bye, Jotaro, Josuke!Red: Joseph Joestar, was it?Red: I'll have that man share the same fate as the Nijimura Brothers!Red: I've won!Koi: Okuyasu!Koi: He got dragged in there!Kkoi: Okuyasu!Koi: Okuyasu!Jojo: Good grief.Jojo: I can't believe we had him cornered and he still got away.Josu: He's a pretty dangerous Stand.main: ,He can be controlled remotely, and in terms of power,Koi: What?! What are you guys talking about?!main: ,he can take advantage of all the electrical companies, making his power infinite.Koi: Why are you analyzing the enemy's abilities when Okuyasu just d*ed?!Jojo: Oh, right. I guess we should worry about Okuyasu.Josu: Right.Jojo: Talk about a silver lining.Jojo: Looks like Okuyasu has really good luck.Josu: Okuyasu was really lucky thathis right arm was chopped off.Koi: Huh?Josu: Shining Diamond!Josu: When I fix his arm, it means his body will come back.Red: !Kooi: Yay! Okuyasu is back!Oku:  it... I-I...Oku: I totally lost to that villain.Oku: ! !Koi: It's not about revenge or winning or losing.Koi: We have to think about protecting Joseph Joestar.Koi: That'll lead to us defeating Chili Pepper.Koi: You have to do that for everyone.Koi: For the place where we live...Josu: Jotaro, this isn't good.Josu: I was taking this lightly.Jojo: Yeah. We have to get to the old man's boat before Chili Pepper does.Jojo: Let's hurry to the port.Koi: Hey, you two! Aren't you acting a bit too cool?Koi: Okuyasu's in shock!Josu: If we're going to the port, this way is closer.Jojo: All right.Koi: Hey, wait!Oku: Surpass my big bro, huh...Oku: You taught me a lesson, Chili Pepper.Guy: Mr. Joestar.Guy: We'll be arriving at Morioh Port any moment now.
02x01 - DeadQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:14Although inspired in part by a true incident, the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.I don't know what you expect me to say.I want an explanation.I'm getting calls from Mr.Tyler every day.Obviously, there's been a mix-up.Obviously.Mr. Hagman, the florist is here.He's got a couple of questions for you.Thank you, Mr.Rivera.You have the weekend to straighten this out.If I hadn't happened to check.It's just a mix-up.What am I gonna tell him come Monday? Part of being a successful businessman is knowing when to worry and when not to.- He's gonna make trouble, I know it.- No, he's not.He doesn't want the publicity.Appearances count, Russell.All I'm saying is, this could be a big problem for me.- I got to catch the ferry back.- Russell, problems are just solutions in work clothes.What are you doing in here? You know you're not supposed to be here alone.Sorry, Mr.H.We got Mr.Knowles on deck.His chart says he d*ed from cirrhosis of the liver.That's drinking, right? Scotty, why don't you go home tonight? Mr.H, I was We'll talk about it next week.You just go home.Tell you mother Happy Easter.Hi.They all asleep? No, not yet.I wanna finish up Mr.Knowles' by today.The viewing's at noon.No, don't wait up.Love you, too.Hey, Doug.Long time, no see.Do I know you? How's my Easter bunny? You got in late last night.I know.The traffic was backed up all the way to Melwood.You work too hard.Do you know what happens to little boys who work too hard? Look what the Easter bunny brought! Look at all that candy.Hey, I bet there's more.Who wants to go on an Easter egg hunt? - Me! Me! - Me! Me! Start looking.Douglas, are you back here? Oh, God.Oh, my God.Law & Order CI Crucifixion pose.No characteristic mutilation.No nail holes.No crown of thorns.Just these.His wife said he didn't have a medical condition.You must've been so much fun in biology class.Actually, my biology teacher, Mr.Dixon, didn't think I was much fun at all.There was no sign of forced entry.There's only one employee with a key, Mr.Rivera.He's been with Hagman for 11 years.There's something floating in the embalming fluid.It's a marijuana seed.Hagman had this kid working for him.Scotty Calderon.Yeah, my moms was a cosmetician for Mr.H.She got sick, so he lets me work part-time, you know, showing me the ropes.I'm sure you could show him a few ropes yourself.Like the many profitable uses for embalming fluid.I don't know about that, man.You don't know about fry sticks, clickums, wet daddies? Damn.Damn is right, Scotty.Joints soaked in embalming fluid sell for 20 bucks a pop on the street.Mr.H found out what you were doing? He didn't know about that, I swear.I just He knew I was getting high.That's why he sent me home early last night.Early? His wife told us you quit work every day at 6:00.Not the last couple of weeks.He had me stay late till he locks up.Why? I don't know, man.Well, anything unusual happen two weeks ago? Anything that had Mr.H worried? Well, there was that message on the answering machine.Some guy was reading from the Bible.Well, do you remember what he said? Something about eating the bread, going back in the ground, like that.Okay, Scott.Just follow the officer out.So that's what a brain looks like on embalming fluid.Hagman was getting harassing phone calls."In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, "till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken." Genesis.I need to use my most important investigative tool.My library card.The ME analyzed the bumps on Hagman.They were filled with a blend of mineral spirit, propylene glycol, surfactant, lanolin, aloe.You think that's some kind of soap? The lab's not sure.The bumps were made post-mortem using a syringe.The skin was red from being b*rned with a lighter or a torch.The Sixth Plague.Boils were the Sixth Plague sent by God to the Egyptians.Each plague was meant to discredit a different Egyptian god.Boils were aimed at Imhotep, the god of medicine.Hagman was k*lled by a religious fanatic? Yeah, who opposes embalming.Well, he's probably not the only undertaker in town who was targeted.Vaughn's Funeral Home Monday, April 13 Ryan took the call.The person asked for me by my first name.Fritz.Was this someone you knew? I didn't recognize the voice.He had a whole spiel.Mostly about embalming being against God's plan.How every time I insert a trocar into a corpse, I desecrate the body.What's a trocar? Tool of the trade.It's inserted near the navel and used to puncture the stomach, bladder, large intestines and lungs.Then / Let's leave it at tool of the trade.That was the term the caller used? Trocar? Yes.Mr.Vaughn, where did you study for your license? Queens College of Mortuary Sciences.I was just about to go home.I just wanted to see how you were.Did you ever hear from that man, Hagman? - No.He was - I told you.Things have a way of working themselves out.Harry, he got k*lled over the weekend.Right in the funeral home.God has a very peculiar sense of humor."Careers in advertising." What is all this? I got this idea on how to sell advertising.You know when you call up a business and they put you on hold? What if instead of playing music they played commercials? See, this is where companies get into trouble.They squander all their capital by extending themselves into areas where they have no track record, no expertise.Stop dreaming and start reaping.I'm going to take a look out back.Out back? Well, why? Is there a problem? No problem yet, Russell.I wanted to offer comfort to the grief-stricken.The mortuary college was teaching us to shake every dime loose from them.- That's why you dropped out? - Yes.And why you made threatening phone calls to your classmate Fritz Vaughn and to Doug Hagman? I don't thr*aten.I call to open a dialogue.To rant against what your literature calls, "The ritual desecration of the human body." Do you have any idea what embalming actually entails? Do you want your anus stuffed with cotton, your mouth glued shut, all to preserve the illusion that death doesn't change anything? Well, there's always cremation.No.Don't you understand? Death and decay are eternal truths of man's existence.Any interference, any desecration is a stain in God's plan.Any desecration at all of humans remains? Yes.He's a true believer.He wouldn't have desecrated Hagman's body.- Not even to make a point? - You heard him.It would put a stain on God's plan.The fake boils, the crucifixion pose, it was all just to throw us off.- It's impressive.- It's demented.It worked.Whoever it is k*lled Hagman, I can't wait to meet them.Mr.Hagman didn't mention any problems with other funeral homes.What about your customers, Mr.Rivera.You ever get any complaints from them? No.People are always grateful.Mr.Hagman did good work.There's a Mr.Tyler here who doesn't sound very grateful.He's threatening a lawsuit.Do you remember him? He brought in his wife and his mother a couple of weeks ago for cremation, but I don't know of any trouble."If as you told me the ashes aren't lost, "then where the hell are they? "You have no idea what agony you've put my family through."If you don't return the ashes by the end of this week, "you'll get a taste of what we've had to endure." It's dated Tuesday, last week.Did you get him his ashes back? Well, I don't remember any paperwork about it.You do the cremations here? No, we send the remains to the Fox Hills Crematory on Staten Island.Right.Tyler, poor guy lost his wife and mother.He called here.I told him I sent the ashes back to Hagman's.- You got any paperwork on that? - Sure."Problems are just solutions in work clothes." I like that.You had the business long? Couple of years, since my dad d*ed.Family business.Interesting work? You get used to it.Burning bodies? Really? You know, I heard they don't burn all the way through.You have to, you know, roll them over like a log in a fireplace and shove them back in.It's called repositioning.And you get used to that? Yeah.You get used to anything.Here.Hagman's signature accepting receipt for the urns containing the Tyler ashes.Can you think of any reason why Mr.Hagman didn't return the ashes to Tyler? No.But, look, I don't mean to sound callous, I mean, the guy just lost his family, but on the phone, he was ranting like some crazy man.Apartment of Damon Tyler Brooklyn, New York Thursday, April 16 He promised I'd get the ashes back within three days.- He promised.- So you threatened him.I told him I was gonna sue.To make sure he never did business in this state again.Your mother lived with you? Yes, she wasn't in good health.She had a heart problem? She had an arrhythmia.It was partially controlled by medication.Partially.She had a pacemaker? Yes, she did.Do you know if it was removed at the hospital before they sent her to the funeral home? I have no idea.What difference does it make? The hospital didn't remove it before sending the body to the funeral home.Hagman's inventory of everything he removed from Mrs.Tyler's body doesn't mention the pacemaker.And this is a big deal because? Pacemakers have to be removed before cremation otherwise, the lithium batteries explode.Gives off a toxic fume and could damage the cremation chamber.Yeah, I heard silicon implants had to be removed.My buddy Martinelli in the 3-7 married a stripper.Did Mr.Matthews mention any problems with Mrs.Tyler? No.You'd think he'd remember if she exploded in his furnace.Maybe the pacemaker popped out in the accident or the hospital.Do we have a list of Hagman's clients who were cremated at Fox Hills? I ironed your grey shirt.I worry about you driving at night.Don't.I'm careful.I'll call you from the motel as soon as I get there./ Okay.My clients need to see me.They like the personal contact.I know you do, too.Oh, I almost forgot.Molly made you some cookies for the road.I found only one family who would let me examine their relative's ashes.Their Aunt Edith.She was cremated six months ago at Fox Hills.I ran the test twice, just to be sure.These so-called ashes are nothing but debris.Debris? Cement dust, dried clay, bits of charcoal briquettes, wood chips.- Nothing human? - Not a spec.Just an urn filled with three pounds of dirt.So, where's Aunt Edith? Detectives, I didn't expect to see you back.Couple of things came up in connection with Damon Tyler.Did you run into any problems when you cremated his mother? No.Why? It came to our attention she had a pacemaker.Oh, well, that would've been removed before we got the remains.That's the problem.See, there's no record that it was removed by anybody.Well, if it hadn't been removed, I would've found out the hard way.It's a slow day.Excuse me? There's no smoke coming from the chimney.Oh, well, we only run the cremation chamber at specific times.When was the last time? Yesterday.- Are you sure? - Mmm-hmm.Because there's birds nesting directly downwind from the chimney.- Well, I don't know much about birds.- Yeah.But you'd think with the smoke they'd keep from nesting there.Well, like you said, you don't know much about birds, so But I like fresh air.Doesn't smell so fresh here.What do you think? It's a little ripe.Well, Fresh Kills Landfill is not far.What's back there? It's just some land my dad bought with the crematory.Hey, you think we could take a walk? You know, I'm real busy, and my insurance won't allow anybody back there without me, so So that's a no on the nature walk? Yeah.Sorry.It's This is Goren.We're at the Fox Hills Crematory.Right.The DA's will be faxing you a search warrant.We got two over by those rocks.Four, could be five down in that little gully.Some are buried deep.Some are just covered with branches.Some look a few weeks old, some Who knows? Rough count so far is north of 30.I've never seen anything like this.You and me both, brother.Dad left a lot of debt.Like when he got the furnace fixed.So you saved on your gas bill by dumping bodies in your backyard? Is that where the $70,000 we found in your bank account came from? It's just a mistake, I swear.I never wanted this.You never wanted what? The crematory? Your dad's business? You had other plans for your life? You wanted to be what, an advertising executive? A webpage designer? Oh, and look at this, an alpaca rancher.Anything but a guy who repositions half-burnt corpses on the grill.This is what you buried back there.Your dreams.Your frustrated ambitions.That's why you defrauded these families.- That's what Hagman found out.- No, no.I didn't I didn't defraud anybody.Come on, Russell, take some pride in your work.Look at the books that you kept.Every decimal in its place.Every penny accounted for.You covered yourself like a pro.Where did you learn to do this? Nowhere.You went to business school? No.You had someone help you keep the books? No.No one.I don't need to do this anymore.I want a lawyer.I want a lawyer, now.I just got the latest tally from the ME.They broke 100 about an hour ago.That's 100 counts of larceny.Not to mention, an innumerable violations of the public health laws.But I'd trade it all for a single count of m*rder.Matthews isn't sophisticated enough to have pulled off Hagman's m*rder or this scam.He's a pie-in-the-sky dreamer with no practical experience in business.But his books and his records would stand up to a tax audit.Does he have a bookkeeper? None we could find.And it's not just that.It's marketing techniques, the ads and the journals.It speaks to a professionalism that's well beyond his grasp.This kind of professionalism."Problems are just solutions in work clothes" "Enthusiasm is the rocket fuel that propels you up the ladder of success." "If you think you can, you can." Matthews' silent partner is a motivational speaker? "Don't get what you want.Want what you get." It's M & H Consulting, Queens, New York.Home of Harry & Susan Rowan Queens, New York Saturday, April 25 Russell is my cousin on my mother's side.He asked for my advice when he took over Uncle Leon's business.So I instructed him on the basics, you know, a little bookkeeping, marketing.He took your lessons to heart.He runs his business in a very professional manner.Except in the one respect.Right.I don't know what got into him.Greed, for one thing.That's probably it.Well, greed only gets you so far.It takes a special kind of callousness to do what Russell did.Russell never struck me as especially callous.You should see what it looks like behind his crematory.Half-buried, bloated corpses, crawling with vermin, rotting entrails seeping out, bodies piled one on top of the other, flesh decaying into each other like a Like a putrid soup.Of course, those people were dead to begin with.Like I said, I don't know what got into him.Harry, lunch is ready.They're detectives.They're asking about Russell.Be right there.That's my wife.You didn't need her, did you? - No.- I didn't think so.This is a terrific little workshop you have here.It's the one thing I miss about being in the city.No room for a workshop.No room to, I don't know, get away from the family.Well, I don't look to get away from the family.Oh, jeez.Do you mind? Well, we'll let you get back to your family.Thanks for giving us your time, Mr.Rowan.You okay? I need to get my hands to the lab.The lab sent me their analysis of the clean-up goop from your hands.It has the same chemical composition as the fluid found in the boils on Hagman.Not a conclusive match but well within the hash marks.How about that.Not only does Mr.Harry Rowan have a green thumb, he has an aptitude for m*rder.I think he does it for a living.His lifestyle, his personality, his obsessive concentration on the task at hand.It fits the profile.So why is a professional hitman interested in a crematory? Well, I'd like to say he was cremating his victims, but there's no cremation going on.You're cataloging the DNA from the crematory? Of course.Could you start running it through the national database? Albert Lundy.His remains were found buried behind the crematory and identified through DNA.He d*ed in October last year.Which is odd because his DNA matched the DNA found at a m*rder scene in Brooklyn three months ago, under the fingernails of the victim.Lyle Curicelli.He was found strangled in an alley.Curicelli was in debt to the Masucci family.His m*rder was a suspected hit.The skin samples and the DNA found under his fingernails were thought to belong to his assailant.- The DNA belonging to Grandpa Lundy? - Right.Next we have Kenneth Hemmerick.Mr.Hemmerick d*ed in June, 1999.His DNA turned up in a blood sample from Newark, on the body of a bookie James Hurly.Mr.Hurly was stabbed to death in January, 2000.Another suspected Masucci hit.We found four more bodies behind the crematory whose DNA turned up at Masucci hits.The DNA from the crematory was harvested from those remains and then planted on these victims to mislead the m*rder investigators and create reasonable doubt in the event of a trial.Harvested and planted by Harry Rowan.That's our theory.In the past, the Masuccis have used two known hitmen.Frank Curtis, he's been in federal custody for a year and a half and Eddie Ferguson.He's been missing for the last six months, presumed to be in hiding or to have fled the jurisdiction.So Harry picked up the slack.Well, we don't think he works exclusively for the Masuccis.There's a lot of blood on his hands.- Oh, hi, honey.- Hi.What are you doing out here? Mommy said we need more ice cream.Ice cream? What do we got in here? Chocolate! Or there's Rocky Road.What do you think? Chocolate.Chocolate it is.Office of Medical Examiner Staten Island, New York Friday, May 2 We got an anonymous phone call from a concerned jogger.He said he saw two guys last week arguing on the Roosevelt Boardwalk.A couple of days ago, he recognized one of them from his picture in the papers.Russell Matthews.He said the other guy had a goatee.So we took a look.Guess what we found caught between the rocks? Eddie Ferguson.Fingerprints confirmed it.Dead of blunt force trauma to the head.That's not all.There were hairs caught under his fingernails.Same coloration as Russell Matthews.I obtained a hair sample from Mr.Matthews.- The hairs matched? - Yes.Well, he looks well-preserved.How long's he been dead? Without a full autopsy, it's hard to tell.I'd say a week or two.I heard Major Case was looking for a Masucci hitman that was doing business with Russell Matthews.Here's your guy.Nice of him to drop out of the sky like that.What's this? Could be a number of things.Looks like a freezer burn to me.The hitman who came in from the cold.I'm telling you, I've never seen this guy before.I don't know what my hair is doing on his hands.Maybe you were in business with Ferguson, maybe you let him take DNA from your backyard, maybe you got in an argument with him.No, no.We like this story, Russell.I mean, unless you have one we like better about your cousin Harry using your backyard as his own petri dish.I am not saying anything against Harry.Who do you think put your hair under Eddie Ferguson's fingernails? Let me get this straight.You think this whole Ferguson thing was set up by Harry Rowan? I don't care.I'm not going against Harry.I've seen Harry go after his own kid brother.Harry'd k*ll you and wash his hands in your own blood.We'll never get anything out of this mutt.Did the autopsy on Mr.Ferguson prove he'd been frozen then thawed? The autopsy proved when it comes to medical science, you're better off asking the Magic 8 Ball.Any luck on a search warrant for Rowan's place? Since the hairs connect the late Mr.Ferguson to Russell Matthews, Judge Whitman feels there's already a viable m*rder suspect lying in the morgue on Staten Island.So Rowan's little ruse paid off.The guy doesn't leave anything to chance.Well, chance is probably what keeps him up at night.There's no such thing as a margin of error in his line of work.Not unless he wants to stay out of jail.The fear of making a mistake, for him must be overwhelming, Consuming.Like an itch he can't scratch.Hi, Ms.Rowan.Let me give you a hand.You're the detectives my husband was talking to? That's right.We need to ask you about his consulting business.Well, I'm sure my husband will be happy to answer all of your questions.Oh, I'm not sure that he'd want to.Does he ever talk about his business travels, his clients? We have two kids, so we have plenty to talk about besides his business.You ever met his clients? We have some photos to help you remember.Eddie Ferguson.Actually, last time your husband saw him, this is how he looked.And then there's James Hurly.This is Mr.Hurly the last time he had a business meeting with your husband.And this job, Tommy Dunne.Shotgun blast to the head while waiting at a stop light.Why are you showing me this? This is what your husband does for a living.He kills people.This is how he paid for this car, for your house, for the Florida condo.It's not true.Okay, you ask your husband.You show him these and then ask him.That day that we came over, did you notice that he didn't want you around when he was talking to us? You ask him.If he's got nothing to hide, then why is he afraid to talk to us in front of you? We got your message.But I bet my partner We came here to return these.Stop harassing my family.Do we understand each other? You're not gonna stay and talk, clear the air? What did I tell you, Ms.Rowan? We can go in there.You can wait right here and see everything.After you.Let's start with a softball.The Saturday night before Easter, where were you? I was stuck on the Taconic.Where had you been? Scouting an industrial park in Ossining.We'll want a list of your clients.Your consulting clients.Do you read the Bible, Mr.Rowan? Not much.Exodus 9:8.The Sixth Plague.This was very It was a very elegant and inspired staging.I'm looking at this as a professional.What's most impressive is the attention to detail.The posing of the body, the reddening of the skin with a torch, the injection of mineral spirit, propylene glycol, lanolin.It's the same composition as your hand cleaner in your little workshop.The same careful planning went into these crimes.The timing, lack of forensic evidence, except of course, for what the perpetrator chose to leave behind.And this is where I step back in awe.The planting of the DNA and the harvesting from human remains.You know, as a pre-emptive measure.It's a It's a stroke of genius.I mean, watching the police fumbling around must've been tremendous fun for the perpetrator, don't you think? Speaking as a concerned citizen, I wish the police were half as capable as this fellow seems to be.Oh, everyone wants us to think that Eddie Ferguson is this fellow, but we think that Eddie was k*lled by, you know, this fellow.k*lled six months ago and kept in a freezer.The reality is in this fellow's line of work, you live with the knowledge that the smallest thing can give you away.Things like this freezer burn right here on Eddie's shoulder.I mean, that tells us that whatever Eddie was wrapped in got loose or torn.Just a small mistake to remind us that no one's perfect.Not that most of us need reminding.Excuse me.Why is he talking to my wife? I don't know.- Porcelain cap? - Yeah.Like from a tooth.You don't remember seeing it in the garage? Mr.Rowan, thank you so much for coming in.The officers will show you downstairs.He said a porcelain cap, like for a tooth.Why would he ask me that, Harry? - What else did he say? - Harry.What else, Susan? He wanted to know if the kids would be home tomorrow morning.I told him they'd be at school.Harry, what is going on? Just get in the car.One search warrant.Limited to the garage.Give me a chance to call home, and I'll go with you.We're not executing the warrant tonight.We want to make sure that Harry Rowan gets a good night's rest.What did you find out? Can we fight it? You are my lawyer, you tell me.Okay.Okay.Yes, I have an idea when they'll be here.Harry.It's late.What're you doing? Go to bed, Susan.Go to bed! You didn't find it, did you? The porcelain cap.You told him I asked you about it? Yes, but I don't understand.The porcelain cap that fell out of Eddie Ferguson's mouth through the tear in the plastic that you wrapped him in before stuffing him into the freezer six months ago right next to the leg of lamb and the Rocky Road ice cream.Oh, my God.Oh, my God, Harry.What did you do? How long do you think it'll take us to find it, Harry? It's not here.It can't be here.I looked.I didn't make a mistake.Sounds like an admission of guilt to me.Harry Rowan, you're under arrest for m*rder.A costly mistake.Harry didn't make a mistake.Eddie Ferguson doesn't wear caps.
02x02 - Bright BoyQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:15In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.So what did you do this week for fun? Did you know that the word "fun" can be found in over 14 languages, and its meaning changes every time? I was thinking about good old American fun.What's fun for me isn't always fun for my dad.You mean like what we did Saturday? Robbie, I'm sure at the school you'll be able to do more of the things you like to do.Here's your father.Kim? The stuff we talked about today, I'd like to be the one to tell him, okay? Sorry I'm late.- How did it go? - We had a good talk.Will you be there tomorrow? Probably not.Good luck.Thank you.- Hello? - Hi, Kim.Oh, hi.Listen, I just got out of a press conference.Got a message Jim Hardy canceled tonight.So here I am with nobody to eat dinner with.What about your wife? Doesn't she eat? I thought you social workers were morally ambivalent about marriage.Not this social worker.If you just want to talk about budget cuts in my department, that'd be fine.Fair enough.I'll pick you up from work.Watch the news tonight.They promised me 15 seconds.There are two kids aged four and six and two adults.Meth heads.Let's go.- Dad! Where are they taking us? - What's happening? Oh, God! / Get your hands off of me! - Please! - Timmy! They're my babies.Please bring them back./ Dad? Timmy! / You bitch! Give them back to me! Now, come on.Stand back.Timmy! Fight back, man! Bite her on the hand! You'll get them back when you can take care of them.Mommy and Daddy love you! Of course not.It's one of the Mayor's pet projects.Will cutbacks mean more potholes and bigger piles of garbage? Next you're gonna ask me when I stopped b*ating my wife.Look, it's up to the maintenance crews and the sanitation workers.Everyone is gonna have to work harder for less money.The Mayor is in conference with his workers right now.We're planning on having a meeting very soon.I bet you've never seen the inside of a Deputy Mayor's apartment.It's got a sterile efficiency some women find irresistible.- Bill.- Okay, okay.And just in case you weren't paying attention when I was talking about our budget problems, I'll send you a memo.Don't worry, it's all in here.Oh, wait.If you won't sleep with me, can you buy me a paper? Somebody might recognize me if I get out of the car.I just want to see what they have on the press conference.Let this be my farewell gift to you.Red Sox are holding on to a 2-0 lead over the Yankees Hello.Hi, baby.I just got out of the restaurant.I'm saying goodbye to Jim Hardy.I'll call you right back.Bye.That wasn't so bad, was it? Mmm-hmm.Hey! Get away from her! Leave her alone! Help! Help! We're being mugged! Help! Law & Order CI What we got is everybody heard the g*nsh*t but nobody saw anything.Any idea what Webster was doing here? Mrs.Webster said she talked to him on his cell phone just before he got k*lled.He told her he was just finishing dinner with Jim Hardy from the Sanitation Workers Union.What does Mr.Hardy say? Well, he told us he canceled his dinner with Mr.Webster that afternoon and spent the evening at home with Mrs.Hardy.Looks like Webster had a passenger, sat close to him, wore a purple cashmere sweater.Tight-fitting size 2 with a plunging neckline.Hmm.That I can't tell from this.I can tell from the bull he was feeding his wife.The window was rolled down.He was reaching over when he was sh*t.Maybe reaching for this.He had someone get him a paper? Maybe we can find partial prints on the quarters.No quarters.None in here.Same story here.We must be in a low-readership neighborhood.Quarters.Two that got away.Hey! Hey! How you doing? Hey, let me give you a hand.Ready.One, two, three, up! There they are.Look at that! It's a gold mine! Let me give you a hand.Hey, you know what? I have two quarters that you missed from the boxes on 12th Street.We're gonna owe the Ledger some money.You were on 12th Street last night? Who said that? Oh, they're your boxes on 12th Street? Your boxes, your quarters.Yeah.Did you see anybody buy a paper from those boxes? Yeah.A woman in a In a black car.She had a fuzzy sweater.We'll need you to help us make a picture of this lady.You stay put.We'll get somebody to take you to our office.Webster had a woman in the car with him.She bought him a newspaper and disappeared.We'll say she's a potential witness and leave it at that.What else? Webster had enemies.City workers, union leaders.We're checking everybody's whereabouts last night.Anybody asks, we're treating this as ordinary street crime.This is Webster's cell phone records for yesterday.He called the Administration for Child Services mid-afternoon.The witness might work in the city's social services.Yes, hello.Beg your pardon? All right, her private line.Is Ms.Stevens in? When? No, that's all right.Thank you very much.Found her.We ID'd her off her prints.City has them on file.Manual strangulation.Mmm-hmm.But the ME thinks she was knocked out first.Do you have her clothes? Cashmere.What year was Webster's car? - '99.- It's got a new car smell.Make sure you mention that to the lab.- Any purse? - No.She was found uptown? Wrapped in a blanket.In a shopping cart, under the FDR at 136th Street.Rumor has it you have a suspect in custody.Yeah.It wasn't me, man.I'm just the wrong guy.In the wrong place at the wrong time.People saw you when she took your kids.You were angry.You were angry when you went down to the ACS, angry when you jumped her outside her apartment / No, no.angry when you strangled her and drove off with her body.Okay.You know what? Okay.What difference does it make? You want to think I did it, fine, go ahead, I don't care.What difference does it make? Adolph.When's the last time you had something to eat? I only eat candy.You want to tell us what you did last night? Well, me and Joanie were upset 'cause, you know, we miss the kids.So we scored, you know, and just chilled out watching TV.Here.It's easier when your fingernails are not so short.Yeah.You usually keep your pinky nails long? Yeah.That's for your ears, right? I got this condition.Oily ears.It's like I got bugs in there.Well, why are your fingernails cut so short now? The other guys did it.The other cops, they did it.They cut it for They said it's for evidence.I smell square one up ahead.Kulik's long pinky nails would've left deep marks on the girl's neck if he'd strangled her.These marks were made by someone with neat clipped nails.Somebody who knew Stevens had a history with Kulik and tried to frame him.I'll go break the bad news to the boys upstairs.Now, there is good news.Since her body was moved, it shows that the Deputy Mayor wasn't the primary target.Office of Kim Stevens Department of Children's Services Tuesday, May 8 Any other parents thr*aten her? No.She had an excellent track record of reuniting families.She has notations in here."Subject looks forward to intellectual challenges."Emotional maturity beyond his years."Sheltered home life."Unsuited for college environment." It reads like evaluations for college admissions.If she was doing anything like that, it was on her own time.Any names to go with the notes? No, just serial numbers."Subject interacts well with college-age adults."Subject has practical concerns.He worries "He worries that he's too short to use bathroom facilities." These subjects are little kids.Little kids being considered for college admissions.Geniuses.There can't be that many places in town that give mortarboards to baby Einsteins.Robbie, I need to speak with your father for a moment.I've just had some shocking news about Ms.Stevens which has forced us to adjust our normal admissions procedures.Based on Robbie's tests and everything, we would like to offer him a place at the school.Congratulations.- You've been accepted.- I have? You made it, Robbie.You did it.Since our students are much younger than the college kids they'll be attending classes with, the university requires that we make sure that they're emotionally equipped to handle the social and academic pressures.Why hire a city social worker to do the evaluations? Well, Kim volunteered.She was an alumnus of Metcalf University, with degrees in social work and psychology.How many children are up for admission? Eight, for six openings for the summer semester.Had Ms.Stevens turned in her evaluation on them? No.She was going to on Thursday when we made our final selection.Last Thursday, the day after she was k*lled.How did you choose the winners without Ms.Stevens' evaluations? We relied solely on the other criteria, IQ scores, SAT's.Please, you're going to disturb the children.Are they working on that problem on the board? Yes.This is a special math tutorial.Really? These little kids are gonna solve that? These are profoundly gifted children.You'll have to forgive my partner, Dr.Leonard.He's feeling very humble right now.The competition to get into your program must be fierce.- I hope you're not suggesting that - We are.Of the six kids that you admitted, how many of them are on the bubble as far as Ms.Stevens' evaluations are concerned? Well, as I told you, we never got her final evaluations.But there was one student I thought might've been, as you say, on the bubble.Home of Charlie Rasmussen Queens, New York Thursday, May 10 We thought Dr.Leonard's program would help Charlie re-focus his goals.But it became apparent after a few days that Charlie's goals didn't need re-focusing.Charlie doesn't have to be a math genius, you know.He can be a musical prodigy.Not to mention, you think the math chicks look anything like Jennifer Connelly? No way, hombre.Besides, the hot babes go for musicians.You see the problem.Music is my life, Mom.Did Ms.Stevens give you any hint that there might be a problem with your son? No.But we knew going in it wouldn't be easy.I told Kim I just wanted off that baby-genius track.Track.You make it sound like it's a race.Oh, it's totally cut-throat at our level.We all know we'll all be competing for the prizes and the research money.Do you know any of the other students that applied to Dr.Leonard's program? Oh, sure.Except for the new guy, we've all been together in math camps since we came out of the test tube.Charlie knows very well he wasn't conceived in a test tube.So who was this new kid? Robbie something.I don't know.Leonard treats him like he's another John Nash.She just leaves him alone and lets him doodle.His father told me he's been home-schooled since kindergarten.Do you know the other parents well? Pretty well.We spend a lot of time commiserating.You have no idea what a challenge it is parenting a gifted child.This math equation.I saw it at the Institute on the board.Oh, yeah.It's the Riemann Hypothesis.One of the Millennium Projects.You solve it, you make a million bucks.Leonard's pet project.She wants one of her baby geniuses to solve it.Can I keep this? Sure.What do I need it for? Oh, he went to school for about five minutes until I saw what was happening to him.Which was what? He was bored, he was so far ahead, and I thought, hell, I can do a better job than those klunkheads.Klunkheads.You think they were klunkheads, Robbie? Well, they were just trying their best.But they didn't have enough training to teach someone like me.Who helped you home-school him? Your wife? My wife d*ed in an accident five years ago.I came up with the curriculum.It was just Robbie and me.And you what, work nights? No.I spend my nights with Robbie.I'm on disability from work.Tae kwon do? You used to compete? A long time ago.But unless I was willing to do it on a national level, it wasn't worth it.Auto racing, did you do that nationally? Regional, quarter mile.Robbie remembers being in his mother's arms watching me race.Let me guess, you were in a band.Oh, that's all in the past.Robbie, you want to show me your room? Now I devote myself full-time to my son's education./ Is that okay? Wednesday night, you remember where you were? Here.Robbie was asleep.- Do you own a car? - No.g*n? Come on.No, I don't own a g*n.Derek Jeter's rookie card, signed.You must be a Yankee fan.Yeah, baseball's a thinking man's game.Do you know who managed the Yankees in the '80s? Who didn't manage the Yankees in the '80s? Billy Martin came back three times, Gene Michael came back twice, Bob Lemon, Yogi Berra, Clyde King, Lou Piniella, Dallas Green, Bucky Dent and Stump Merrill.Wow.Your dad take you to the games? No.He says watching sports doesn't add any value to my education.But I follow the stats on my computer.But you play.What position? Oh, no.I don't have time.How were your interviews with Kim Stevens? Oh, she was a nice person.Did she tell you that you might not get into the program? No.The Riemann Hypothesis.You know what? This does not look fun.My dad says that sometimes the way to solve a problem is to let your right brain work on it.So that's what I'm doing.I really like your drawings.Hey, if you don't need them, - you think I can have them? - Sure.Okay.Catcher, that's what you play.How did you know? It's the thinking man's position.You really need a million bucks that bad? It's Robbie's calculations.They contain symbols that aren't in the other kids' work, and they're not in any work done on the Riemann Hypothesis.They don't belong there.Well, he's 10 years old.He made a mistake.No.There's no mistake.This symbol.Infinity.This one.It's Omega.The end.This one.Theta.Death.Now Robbie wrote these in his calculations over and over again.Infinity.The end.Death.He's suicidal.Kim Stevens found out.She was going to keep him out of the program.If Kim Stevens decided Robbie was psychologically unfit, his father might've found out.Maybe he thought he could change her mind.Webster got into the picture.The dad panicked.And k*lled two people just to get his child into an educational program? Dads k*ll over hockey.Why not over education? Yes.Especially this dad.The rock star, martial arts expert, drag racing champion.All attention-seeking careers, all of which he's failed at.But if his son succeeds, the spotlight's back on him.Have you confirmed that Ms.Stevens diagnosed Robbie Bishop as unfit? The school won't release her files without the father's permission.Fat chance of that.Unless we could have him removed as guardian of his son's records.We'd have to convince a judge there's probable cause to consider Mr.Bishop a m*rder suspect.The lab found a mixture of higher paraffins imprinted on the back of her sweater.The substance is a preservative, Cosmoline, used on new cars shipped from overseas.It's shaped like a flashing around a car window.Bishop pushed her up against his car.Bishop doesn't have a car.We checked.Do we have Bishop's employment history? He worked in the Stevedores Union.Worked for Autotrain Freight Forwarders.Still works there a couple of days a month.Taking cars off boats, putting them on trains.Wouldn't be too tough to borrow one of those cars for the night.You match the imprint on the sweater to a model of car in that shipyard, that should be enough probable cause to satisfy a judge.Enough for a search warrant, too? I want everything catalogued and returned, you understand? You got some balls coming between me and my son.I'm the only one here who's got his best interest at heart.You're not concerned that your son might be suicidal? If Robbie was unhappy, he'd tell me.You couldn't tell from all these personality tests? Those just measure social adjustment.I have to make sure he's not getting overloaded.I've always read that kids with high IQ's, they thrive on pressure.They need it to help them develop.There's nothing I hate more than discussing my child with a know-it-all.Hmm.Are you dyslexic? 'Cause you wrote down a phone number, then crossed it out and then re-wrote it in the right order.I was tired, that's all.Where's your partner? Where'd she go? My mom used to tell me stories at night before I went to sleep.Now your dad reads to you.Yes, until I fall asleep.He never leaves me alone.What about last Wednesday? Did he read to you? I just went to sleep.I was pooped.Robbie, the detectives have work to do.Let's get out of their way.Look what he showed me.His aunt and uncle.They live in western Mass.He says he visits every chance he gets.There he looks happy.If he was there.You see Robbie's face? The lighting and the shadows don't match the others.He digitally put himself in this photo.Looks like Stevens did a pretty thorough work-up on Robbie.At least he had fun with her, she took him to the Bronx Zoo, to Little League in Prospect Park one Saturday.Yeah.To observe him with kids his own age.She says here he's remarkably well-adjusted.How could she miss this kid was miserable? Says here she gave him an MMPI.Do you have it over there? Well, if you tell me what it is in plain English, I might be able to find it.Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.It tests social adjustment.I remember this.We had to take it the last year of high school.So did we.How did you do? I had to go to my counselor's office and have a talk with the school shrink.How about you? Me? I was so well adjusted, they elected me prom queen.Well, Robbie's scores are off the chart, indicating a high level of adaptability and socialization.Not the kid we saw.His dad must have coached him.He had all the personality tests, the literature.Wasn't taking any chances.Well, it worked.She was recommending him for admission.Then why would David Bishop get the idea that she wasn't? I have no idea how Mr.Bishop could've gotten that impression.I was never anything but absolutely positive about Robbie's joining our program.I wanted him.You told Mr.Bishop that? That would've been impolitic.I had to wait for Kim's evaluation.I mean, what do those evaluations tell you, anyway? These kids are bound to be maladjusted.They've never fit in anywhere.But here, they're with their own kind.You've created a safe haven for them.I'd like to think so.And if Robbie acts out, I mean, it's nothing you're gonna take too seriously.That's right.It was just a normal reaction to his special circumstances.So he acted out, then.That's not what I said.You said his acting out was normal.What did he do that you didn't take seriously? When he came for his first interview in my office, he fainted.His father said he had the flu.What did you think it was? Stress, obviously.This was the most important interview of his young life.Why wasn't this incident in Ms.Stevens' file? Because I didn't tell her.It was immaterial to his suitability.Uh, you have classes seven days a week? The children only attend six days.Saturdays for some, Sundays for others, depending upon their religious persuasion.- Saturdays for Robbie? - Yes.Did he know he'd have to go to school on Saturdays? Absolutely.We make it clear when the children apply the level of commitment that we expect from them.Would you like to go to a Little League game? I talked to Dr.Leonard.She doesn't think you're giving 100%.But I'm doing the best I can.Nothing is more important than your education.- You know that, right? - I know.I might not always be there to remind you.Where are you going? Nowhere.All I'm saying is I want you to concentrate harder.You have your lunch? All right.See you at 4:00.I remember this kid from the tryout.He knew a lot about baseball.Did he show up by himself? No.His mother was there, in the stands.I remember.He pointed her out to me.Yeah, that's her.These kids, they know that their games and practices are on Saturdays, right? Yeah.We tell them at the tryout.Thanks.He knew if he got accepted into Leonard's program, he wouldn't be able to make the games.But he signed up anyway, five days before Leonard made her picks.Robbie must've been convinced he wouldn't be admitted.Or else he was making sure he wouldn't be by lying to his father, telling him that Kim Stevens was giving him a negative evaluation.Hoping like any normal 10-year-old his dad would then just forget about the school.Not realizing that his dad is not like any normal 40-year-old.If he really didn't wanna be in this program, why not just tell his father? Oh, and risk disappointing the only parent that he has left? It's much safer for him to lay the blame on Kim Stevens.Her notes suggest they had a good relationship.Couldn't he have confided in her? Well, maybe he tried to tell her in his own way.The Greek symbols in his math equations.Anything more overt might have put him in direct conflict with his dad.When no one picked up on how depressed this poor kid was, lying was his only way out.Now you need the truth from him, what he told his father, what he knows about his father's whereabouts the night of the killings, assuming you can talk to the boy without his father.The only place Robbie's away from his dad is at the university.We'd need Leonard's permission to talk to him there.I imagine I could persuade her.You want to subject a minor child to a police interrogation without his father being present or even notified? It wouldn't be an interrogation.He's a witness, not a suspect.I could be sued for allowing it! You could be charged if you don't.That is ridiculous.If I thought that there was abuse, I would do something about it.Even if it meant losing Robbie Bishop as one of your students? Of course.Yeah.A profoundly gifted child who graduated high school at age seven? Who scored a perfect 800 on his math SAT's? Whose IQ was recorded at 246 on the Stanford-Binet scale? Who represents your only chance of one of your students solving a Millennium Prize problem? You would risk losing him over a little fainting spell? I should mention that while I investigate this abuse charge, I can shut down your institute.Which, I'm sure, will generate a great deal of interest from the press.Hey, Dad, I'm ready for school.Good, great.Let me just finish my coffee.Your lunch is right there.Colorado? We're going to Colorado? There's a special school.They heard about you.I don't know.There was something else in the mail.From the Little League.It's okay, Robbie.You're allowed a mistake every now and then.Hey, Robbie.Dr.Leonard told me this is where you like to spend your lunch hour.What are you doing up here? Nothing.I I just wanna talk to you.I don't wanna talk about my dad.We don't have to.We could talk about this.I was wondering what you thought of Boston this year.Boston? What, you don't like Boston? They're leading the league.This week.They choke every time they get a lead.They didn't choke the last time they played the Yankees.Four-zip.Thanks to Jeter, he lost that game.Jeter was safe at second.With the bases loaded, they could've tied the game and gone into extra innings.No way! Look, I Look, I saw that play on the news.He was out by a mile.I saw it happen.He was safe.Why, you You watched the game? Your dad was out that night? No, he was home.Well, you said that your dad doesn't let you watch baseball.Sometimes he does."No added value." That's That's what you said.Come on, Robbie, tell me the truth.Was your dad home? No.Oh.That was Wednesday night.I think the night before you found out you were admitted here? You didn't think you were gonna get in, did you? You thought that you were gonna be playing baseball on Saturdays, instead of being stuck in here.Look, I know that you tried to let people know how you felt about coming here.They wouldn't see it.You told your dad a fib? About Ms.Stevens keeping you out of the program? You hate it in here.You know how I know? You told me.Yeah.You've been thinking about these things a lot.Maybe you thought about hurting yourself.What is it about this place that makes you so unhappy? Is it the other kids? The teachers? Is it the work? The work is too hard? Can I see your book? Please? Has Dr.Leonard seen this? No.- Has your dad? - No.Nobody knows? I just have to try harder.You again.What is it now? Now we're here for you.I have to pick up my son from school in an hour.We already have that covered.You going somewhere? Colorado, maybe? I don't have to answer that.Guess what? Wherever it is you're going, our squad room's on the way.I hope you're not gonna keep me away from Robbie too long.He's still adjusting to being away from home every day.Robbie will be fine.He's a remarkable kid.I know that.Who first noticed he was unique, you or your wife? My wife told me she thought he was bright.But it was your idea to test him? Yes.After she passed away? I owed it to her to help him live up to his potential.He tested well.He maxed out the scale.The Stanford-Binet IQ scale.Right.And the Wechsler Scale.He did that one when he was six.And then he got that perfect score on his math SAT's.That must've been pretty gratifying for you.Because you were something of a math whiz yourself in high school.Where did you hear that? Just from your old report cards.They were among the papers that we took.I did okay in high school.You expect more from yourself than just okay.I mean, if it weren't for the dyslexia, you would've been an "A" student.Twenty-five years ago, they didn't know much about learning disabilities.But you have the drive to succeed, and you found other ways to be recognized.Like being a racecar driver or a rock star.Or the father of a genius.And that's where you put your best efforts.Why not? I mean, that's what being a father is all about, making sure your kid gets the best.Paid off.David, we talked to Dr.Leonard today.And she thinks that he's done it.- Done what? - The Riemann Hypothesis.He's made a breakthrough and solved it.What? Oh, my God, that's That's fantastic! I never dreamed that he'd be able to do it.All our work, it was worth it! Here.Have a look at his workbook.What is this? This doesn't make sense.You sure? Yeah, I'm sure.I know enough about math to know this is What, gibberish? The work of a bright eighth grader wrestling with concepts beyond his comprehension? My son didn't do this.Yes, he did.This is what he does when you're not around.When you're not there to help him.No, no, not my kid.You're not there to finish the Wechsler IQ test for him and work out the answers for the SAT's Robbie did those by himself.The only one he did by himself is the Stanford-Binet and that's only after he memorized the manual you gave to him before taking the test.David, Robbie told us about the memory exercises, about the vocabulary builders, about the constant coaching.That's just how we work together.He's just a little boy.Yeah.A smart little boy with a terrific memory and an overwhelming fear of disappointing his father.But he's not a genius.But you're wrong.He's afraid to tell you.That's why he lied to you about Kim Stevens' intentions.These are her notes on Robbie.She was giving him a positive evaluation.Oh, God.Robbie.I need to see my son.I need to see my son.I need to tell him Robbie! Robbie! I want to talk to him.Robbie.He needs me.He's fine.His aunt and uncle are on their way down from Massachusetts.You want to help your son? I want to talk to him.Robbie You have to own up to the murders.Tell the truth.Why? You confess, there's no trial.There's no need for us to bring in Robbie to testify that That you weren't home that night.There's no need for him to know that the lie that he told you is the reason why you k*lled Kim Stevens.You can spare him that knowledge.Okay.Okay.m*rder two, two counts, concurrent sentences.The worst thing for him? He'll miss Robbie's college graduation.
02x03 - Anti-ThesisQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:15In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.until George finally pulled me aside and explained the difference between hegemony and hominy.In any event, the reason that I crashed this wonderful gathering, George, was to thank you for your years of service as Chairman of the Department of American Studies.Well, have you made a decision on my replacement? No.You know, if Sanders doesn't get the chair, he's threatening to leave.George, it has to be my decision along with the regents'.I mean, Sanders is a brilliant teacher when he bothers to show up to class.But with lectures and talk shows He even did an ad for the Gap.And where is he today? Probably still working on that rap record.Dr.Winthrop? Well, what can I do for you, Mark? I need to talk to you about another extension on my dissertation./ Hmm.I was hoping you could speak to the new chair Well, as soon as there is one, you can speak to him or her yourself.I can't believe he said rap record.Sanders will flip his afro.Hello, Mark.Were you waiting for one of us? Mmm-mmm.So, if Winthrop's soured on Sanders, does that put you in the lead? Winthrop doesn't much like me, either.My critique of patriarchy in academia hit a little too close to home.Oh, donnez-moi un break.I thought the politics at Oxford were insane.You know why the battles in academia are so vicious? It's because the stakes are so low.Are you sure? I distinctly heard him say him or her.And "her" can only mean Dr.Fellowes.I talked to her last week.She said it was obvious I'd never finish my dissertation, and it was time to let someone else have my spot.I'd hate to see that happen, Mark.A decade of hard work down the drain.Now if you were head of the department, would you But I'm not head of the department.That's up to Winthrop.You know that.How dare you characterize anything I do as a rap record.Call it whatever you want.I prefer "danceable education." I expect my professors to be in the classroom, teaching.I'm not your professor.Just because you run this university like a plantation, don't make you massa and we your field hands.I came here to discuss the future of American Studies at Hudson University.I am the future of American Studies.And if you don't make me head of the department, I will leave.And sue you for discrimination.Dig? We may be here awhile, Kate.I'll make coffee.How did you get in here? What are you doing? No! No! Law & Order CI The guard saw them come in at around 9:15.We'll need a list of everybody with keys to the building.Any idea what Winthrop was doing here with his secretary? Well, the guy who should know, the vice-rector, Mr.Frisch, well, he doesn't know.Nothing in his book.Just a breakfast meeting with something called the "AS Committee." Ask Mr.Frisch what that is.The k*ller came out from the front.Winthrop He raised his arm, took the first blow to his wrist from a A blunt instrument with a round striking face.The k*ller chose a w*apon that would have meaning.A gavel.The k*ller wanted justice.Winthrop came in the room.The k*ller was already waiting.Winthrop turned on the light, and the k*ller att*cked him.The secretary had gone to make coffee, she walked in on it.She tried to get away.Mr.Frisch, when's the last time you spoke to Mr.Winthrop? Around 5:00.And that meeting you asked about, it was a search committee for the American Studies Department.They're deciding on a new chairman for the department.Does Miss Robbins live alone? I believe she has a roommate.Apartment of Kate Robbins Wednesday, September 26 Oh, my God, what am I gonna tell her parents? They're supposed to come up from Charleston this weekend.Did you see her last night? When I came back from the gym, she was working on her computer and listening to a CD.And she was listening on these? Yes.I think there was something wrong with the CD.Why do you say that? She kept pressing stop and play, stop and play.Well, there's no CD in here.- Did you see her leave? - Yes.She grabbed something out of her printer.She said she had to go to Winthrop's office for a couple of hours to work.Here's the last document she printed.Hey, it's lyrics.The writer came of age in the '60s and '70s, probably in the Bay Area, Oakland.Here, "Flipping Pancakes for Preschoolers." That's the Black Panthers' breakfast program.And he works for Hudson University.Okay, how do you figure that? Here, "Massa will go the way of the Dutchman's mercenary "who gave his name to the plantation." Henry Hudson sailed for the Dutch East India Company.He's the Dutchman's mercenary, and the plantation is Hudson University.And massa would be Winthrop.So the writer's middle-aged, African-American, from California, works at the university.And wanted Winthrop to disappear like Henry Hudson.You could tell all that just from these lyrics? Do you know why Dr.Winthrop had his secretary transcribe the lyrics to your CD? You're asking the wrong person.Unfortunately, we can't ask the right persons.You're up for the chairmanship of your department, right? Winthrop was meeting with the search committee? The committee had already voted to approve my recommendation.Well, maybe Massa Winthrop was hoping your lyrics would change their mind.What is this about? Your whereabouts Tuesday night.I was in my office, here, grading papers.These papers here? Yes, sure, those papers."Bitch: Gender Metaphors in the American Literary Tradition." These courses sound like a lot of fun.I try to keep things lively.This is cool here, what you wrote in the margin."Civilization, an old bitch gone in the teeth." Did you make that up? No, Ezra Pound did.Can anybody vouch you were here all evening? Valerie Goodman, she's one of my teaching assistants.Good old Ezra Pound.I was checking footnotes for Professor Sanders' next book until about 10:00.He told us he was grading papers on gender metaphors.That sounds right.He made an interesting notation on one of the papers."Civilization, an old bitch gone in the teeth." It's by Ezra Pound.Did you know that? No, but it sounds like Pound.Professor Sanders knew it was Pound.Why wouldn't he? Well, he would.But you see, the person who made the notation, the person who actually graded the paper, attributed the quote to T.S.Eliot.Professor Sanders wasn't in that night grading papers, was he? True or false, Miss Goodman? And we don't give incompletes.He said he had a dinner with some people from NYU about a job offer.How long was the dinner? He came back around 8:30.- He was in a bad mood.- Why? He didn't say.He just shut himself in his office and got on the phone.Then he left at 9:30.He told me if anybody asked, he was grading papers all night.I'm sorry.It's okay, Valerie.Thanks.Doesn't sound like he got that job offer.That would make him more desperate to get his promotion here.Except Miss Goodman alibis him for the time of the m*rder.He made a call from his office.Professor Sanders is a charismatic teacher surrounded by impressionable minds.Students lie for him.Maybe one of them k*lled for extra credit.Doorknobs in Winthrop's office had been wiped clean.No witnesses who saw anybody leave the administration building.Any candidates for the extra credit? We've cleared Sanders' teaching assistants.Now we're looking at the PhD students in American Studies.Sanders is their advisor.He's probably known some of them for years.How's this for a dissertation topic? "Fighting in the Captain's Tower."The Influence of T.S.Eliot and Ezra Pound on American Popular Culture." Sounds like the same guy who graded Sanders' papers.Yeah, and confused Eliot and Pound.Mark Bayley.He's been working on this dissertation for 10 years.Don't universities put a clock on these things? Bayley's gotten five extensions.And a nice chunk of change in student loans.Office of Mark Bayley Hudson University Friday, September 28 Professor Sanders travels a lot, so I offered to grade those papers.Is that why your thesis is taking so long, you're too busy doing favors for Professor Sanders? My thesis is coming along fine."The old bitch gone in the teeth." That's Pound, right? No, Eliot.Professor Sanders says it's Pound.You sleep here? I'm between apartments.Besides your student loans, how do you support yourself? I work at the library on Saturdays.Well, at least you eat healthy.I told you it was Pound.Maybe that's why your thesis is taking so long.When'd you quit? You've got nicotine gum.Two years ago.When does your current extension run out? At the end of this semester? It's just a technicality.Winthrop's phone logs have you calling him every day about it.You were practically stalking him.That's not true.Anyway, extensions are up to the chair of the department.The new chair.Your hero, Professor Sanders.Sanders call you Tuesday night to see Winthrop? No, I was here Tuesday night.Nobody called me.What about your girlfriend? What girlfriend? The one who bought you these shoes.- I bought them.- No, you didn't.Those are the kind of shoes you buy.Converse, Vans.Come on, these are Well, they definitely have a woman's touch.I bought these shoes myself.I had a wedding.You wore tan shoes to a wedding? Yes, I wore tan shoes.You people are wasting my time.Not just any tan shoes.$2,000-a-pair John Lobb tan shoes.We could just ask.See anything you like? I don't see anything I don't like.My wife thinks I need a new pair of everyday shoes.Well, I should say.Darling.These? I don't know.The whole ankle-boot thing I know.You really liked the pair that Mark was wearing.He said he bought them here recently.Not him, his girlfriend.Mark never pays for anything unless he has to.Do you see the shoes here? Not the exact shoe.Oh, I'm starting to get frustrated.Well, you'd have a record of what they bought, right? I mean, you could look it up.Mark's early thirties, curly hair.Student at Hudson, orange backpack, chews gum, nicotine gum.Oh, yes, yes.He came in wearing skateboard loafers.But his girlfriend, she's a stunner.Then again, I'm a sucker for the take-charge type.Oh, you noticed that about her.She must've made him try on 30 pairs.She was whipping him into shape.Not that he seemed to mind.Oh, here they are.It was a pair of double-buckle Williams.Look at how Elizabeth spells her last name.Hitchens with an "E".Is her number on there? I want to ask her to dinner Saturday night.What a good idea.Excuse me.Isn't that the Hudson University switchboard? She did say something about being a visiting professor.A professor? Well, he didn't tell us that.Your cousin's a very bad boy.Thanks.Apartment of Elizabeth Hitchens Saturday, September 29 Terrible business, this m*rder.My colleagues at Oxford gave me dire warnings about America.And this just confirms their worst fears.Well, we hope it doesn't sour you on our country.Oh, heavens, no.A little danger keeps you on your toes.This place doesn't look all that dangerous.Hudson's taking good care of you.Actually, an Oxford alumnus volunteered it.He's spending the year abroad.So rather than having the flat sit empty How lucky for you.Well, I assume that my good fortune isn't what brought you here.You are obviously here to talk to me about Winthrop's m*rder, which I'm sorry to say I know nothing about.We're going with the theory it's somebody at the university.Well, everyone knows that academics are all talk and no action.Does that include you? If it did, I would've stayed in my cozy little office on Manor Road lecturing women's writing and punting on the Cherwell on the weekends.No skinny-dipping in Parson's Pleasure? Very good, Detective.Did you memorize the Oxford tour guide on your way here? No.No, I spent a couple of weeks there once chasing coeds.Took you that long to catch one? I'm shocked.Well, that's very funny, Professor.Does Mark Bayley find you funny? He might, if he had a sense of humor.I don't know him that well.Well enough to buy him a pair of shoes.Just a gesture.You know graduate students.They never have a pot to piss in, and Bayley was on his uppers, literally.I see you like opera.These tickets for Don Giovanni.Yes.Not my favorite.I lean towards Penderecki.I hate to be a spoilsport, but did you see Bayley Tuesday night? No.Why would I? You might have, if you were having an affair with him.Well, that would be against university policy.The bottom line, she didn't alibi Bayley.No.But she lied about having an affair with him.Men only let two kinds of women buy shoes for them, their mommies and their significant others.Hitchens' work visa expires in three months.Any extension has to be supported by the new chairman of her department.Assuming Sanders would support her and that she even wants to stay.She's bought a new subscription for the opera.She's applied for a driver's license.She's making herself at home.I didn't tell them about the shoes.It's that big detective who noticed them.That big detective is smart.He traced the shoes to the store.The whole thing's coming apart.People think Sanders had something to do with it.Now he won't get the chairmanship.It'll blow over.What? Nothing.Just have your gum and get into bed.I doubt if Roland Sanders would want to keep Elizabeth on.He once accused her of being an apologist for Australia's shabby treatment of the aborigines.- She's Australian? - Mmm-hmm.A graduate of the University of Sydney.Well, you could never tell by her accent.What else do you know about her? Well, she ran an educational foundation in Australia.Rising star at Oxford.If she's a rising star at Oxford, why leave in the first place? I don't know.Whatever her plans, they don't matter now.Sanders has no hope of becoming chair.His candidacy is tainted.Who's next in line? Christine Fellowes.It's pretty much a lock.Office of Christine Fellowes Hudson University Monday, October 1 In theory, I wouldn't be opposed to offering someone of Elizabeth's caliber a permanent position.In theory.What about in practice? I'm not head of the department yet.Please, the regents will decide on Friday.- But you're already packing.- Well Let me help you with this.Penderecki.The Devils of Loudon.You like opera? I'm getting to.This was a gift.There was a beautiful performance of Don Giovanni the other night.You would've loved it.I did.A friend took me.Friends with good taste, huh? One more thing.This professional student, Mark Bayley, would you give him an extension if you became chair? He's already written a thousand pages of his thesis and he's nowhere near done.He needs to go.Professor Hitchens will be sorry.Why would she? She thinks he's an idiot.Oh, no.I think she's been able to overlook his shortcomings.They've become close friends.At least, that's what we heard.I Your source is wrong.Elizabeth wouldn't violate university policy.Not if she wanted to be asked back.In American literature, the descent into madness is usually preceded by obsession.A consuming obsession.Example, anyone? All right.I'll get you started.Moby-d*ck.What characterizes Ahab's obsession? Yes, in the back.The dogged, unrelenting pursuit of evil.Interesting, evil.I always fancied it was man's unrelenting pursuit of his own potency.All right, everyone, I expect you to make a dent in Moby-d*ck by the end of the week.Sometimes a whale is just a whale.Nothing is ever just something.Not even detectives.Or professors.Or graduate students, for that matter.That sounds a bit ominous.Well, it's certainly not good news for Mark Bayley.We're about to arrest him for Winthrop's m*rder.Am I expected to run and warn him? Because you've seriously misconstrued my relationship with him.But you can settle a bet for me.My partner thinks that Bayley acted alone.But I think that I think that Professor Sanders He put him up to it.Why do you think that? Well, Sanders, he had the most to gain from Winthrop's m*rder.And the k*lling, well, it required qualities that elude Bayley.Planning, organization.I mean, you agree? Well, you're not wrong about Mark.There is a reason why he hasn't finished his thesis.He has no discipline.I heard his thesis runs a thousand pages.T.S.Eliot and Ezra Pound have a love child and his name is Bob Dylan.I mean, donnez-moi un break.This is what passes for scholarship in this country? So you don't think popular culture's fair game? Well, Mark's is the worst kind of pop literary analysis.Pathetic attempt to synthesize high and low culture.It wouldn't butter your parsnips.You're right.We did misconstrue your relationship.No, Mark.Well, just tell them you don't know anything.You don't know, you don't remember.Yes, those are all good answers.No, I can't see you tonight.Look, Mark, you'll be fine.Yes, same here.Who was that on the phone? It was Bayley.Why is he calling your cell phone? I was calling him back, silly.He's worried because his great mentor Roland Sanders has fallen out of favor, and he wants me to put in a good word for him with you.Why does he think you can help him? Well, he's under the strange delusion that you and I are friends.Major Case Squad Interview Room Tuesday, October 2 Hey, that's quite a woman you got there.A real take-charge lady, Elizabeth Hitchens.I don't know.The clerk at the shoe store said she had you jumping through hoops.I don't remember.Well, let's face it, Mark.That's exactly the kind of woman a guy like you needs.Somebody that helps you, you know, keep those thoughts focused.Do what has to be done, right? I don't know.Like k*lling Winthrop.I mean, that was her idea.No.It wasn't anybody's idea.We're pretty sure it wasn't Sanders'.I'm sure it wasn't yours.I mean, even Hitchens thinks that someone would have had to put you up to it.What do you mean, she thinks? Well, she said that you didn't have any discipline.That's why you Well, you never finished your thesis.The title, "Fighting in the Captain's Tower," that's Dylan, right? Ezra Pound and T.S.Eliot fighting in the captain's tower.Desolation Row.The whole album's a touchstone of American literature.That's my thesis.Exactly.What Hitchens said, exactly, is, "Donnez-moi un break." I'm trying to remember what else she said."The worst kind of pop literary analysis." She said it was brave."A pathetic attempt to synthesize high and low culture." No, no.- You're making it up.- Oh.How did she put it? "It wouldn't butter your parsnips." I'm not making it up, am I? She used you, Mark, to k*ll Winthrop, to discredit Sanders, so the promotion would go to her friend, Christine Fellowes.Her close and intimate friend.Oh, my God.Oh, God.What did I do? You want to tell us what happened? She told me to She planned it.I'll get a stenographer.She told Winthrop to meet her at his office.Why did I listen to her? How did you get in the building? She gave me a key.She took it from Professor Fellowes.She said she never uses it.You still have it? No.I gave it back.Mark, are you all right? Call the paramedics! There's no pulse.He just stopped breathing.Bayley d*ed of anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction.A reaction to what? They don't know yet.We're waiting for the tox report and Bayley's medical records.Before he d*ed, he implicated Hitchens.His statement's of no use now.Have you heard from Scotland Yard? They have no outstanding warrants for Hitchens, no open investigations.Bayley's allergic reaction was to peanuts, specifically peanut oil.The nicotine gum.She spiked it with a needle through the packaging.She knew he was a liability.When I went to her class, she knew what I was doing.She knew I'd use her words to turn him.We can't assume she knew he had an allergy.It's in his medical records.He might have mentioned it to her.What I had in mind was proof she knew.Well, it depends if Bayley eats alone.Two months ago, he was rushed to Emergency from a Thai restaurant.Peanuts are a common ingredient in Thai cooking.Thai King Friday, October 5 Yes, I remember them.He got very sick.They should have told us he was allergic to peanuts.- Who ordered? - The woman.She ordered som tum.Green papaya salad.Thai chili, fish sauce and peanuts.Well, it's clearly marked which dishes have peanuts.Didn't he see this? Sure.But the woman ordered in Thai.So Bayley wouldn't understand.She speak fluent Thai? Yes, but low-class.Did she say how she learned it? She said she lived in Thailand 15 years ago.She say where? I asked.She laughed.She said in Chatuchak.Chatuchak is the location of the Lard Yao Maximum Women's Prison.I did a search for Australian women who had been imprisoned in Thailand.I found one who matched Hitchens.Nicole Wallace.She and her French boyfriend were convicted of k*lling eight male tourists in Thailand.She'd seduce them, they'd rob them and he'd k*ll them.At the trial, she testified against him.He got life, she served 10 years and got deported back to Australia.It could be her.The Australian Consulate's getting me a passport photo of the real Elizabeth Hitchens.The one who was studying at the University of Sydney while Nicole Wallace was in prison.Wallace passed herself off as a professor of literature.Quite a feat.Well, maybe it was catching up to her.That might explain why she's desperate to establish herself here.Then where's the real Professor Hitchens? Nicole Wallace k*lled the real Elizabeth Hitchens, applied for a passport in her name and went off to Oxford.This woman's very, very good.Oh, good, you're both here.Can we come in? We heard.It's official.- Congratulations.- Thank you.Now that you're chair of the department, you can give your friend that permanent job she's wanted so much.Well, I don't know about that.She's a real catch.Now I could be wrong, but there can't be many Oxford professors who've spent time in Thai prison.For eight murders, no less.Are we meant to take this seriously? It's thanks to her you got your promotion.She helped Mark Bayley k*ll Winthrop.You can stop right now.Bayley told us the whole story before he d*ed from poisoning.I don't believe any of this.Prove it for yourself.She stole the key to the administration building from you and gave it to Bayley.I would've noticed.She slipped it back on your key ring.Except Bayley gave her back the wrong key by mistake.He gave her his spare to his office.You've really outdone yourselves, Detectives.Well, let's check Bayley's office.This should be the administration key.It's you who outdid yourself, Nicole.That is your name, Nicole Wallace? This is utter nonsense, Christine.It's a trick.I didn't take your key.You did sleep with him.You lied to me.For heaven's sake, Christine.I can't have you here.You're relieved of your duties as of immediately.In that case, you're under arrest.For what? You just got fired.You're in violation of your work visa.Nothing has happened to Elizabeth Hitchens because I am Elizabeth Hitchens.I mean, do you honestly think that I could fool the dons of Oxford for one minute if I wasn't who I say I am? You had plenty of time to read in Lard Yao Prison.My dear woman, there is more to literary scholarship than reading books.Nobody said you aren't bright, Nicole.- Elizabeth.- Nicole.The game's up.You botched the key exchange.Bayley gave you the wrong key.You know bloody well that that's not true.No, I don't bloody well know.But the real culprit does.Now you see the problem.You can't expose our trick without exposing your own culpability.And you know what that's called, your being an expert on the modern American novel and all.Yes, well, I never much cared for Heller.Look, you can bang on all you want, but I am invoking my right to be silent.No, you don't have that right.I know what rights are, and I'm also invoking my right to an attorney.No, you don't have that right either.What are you talking about? You're a foreign national with no green card, no tourist visa, no valid work permit.That makes you a person with no status.I can keep you as long as I want to.Until we build a case against you.You wouldn't dare.What do you mean, I can't see her? I have been retained by the university to represent her.She's in this country illegally.She is here employed under the terms of a valid work visa.I reinstated her.I found out the police changed the lock on Bayley's office so that it could be opened with a key to the administration building.The whole thing was a sham.We still believe Miss Hitchens is here under false pretenses.You're not entitled access to her.We'll see.I'm walking down the block into federal court and filing for a writ of habeas corpus.If you really are Elizabeth Hitchens, this will be easy.Just tell me the name of the educational foundation in Melbourne.I don't have it in my papers.I'm sure that that's a lie.And if I am impersonating Elizabeth Hitchens, don't you think that I would have committed her entire work history to memory? That's my social security number and my birth date.Yes, it's remarkable the fountain of information that can spring from those little numbers.Home address, next of kin, mother's maiden name, mother's address.Tell me, Robert, how often do you get up to the Carmel Ridge Center? Once a week.And a phone call every day.How old were you when you first realized it? No.You want to play, then it's gonna have to be tit for tat.You have to tell me something true about you, about Nicole.All right.I did meet Nicole before I left for England.She told me things.Where is she now? I don't know.Carried away by dingoes? It happens a lot in Australia.What did she tell you? She told me that she enjoyed being under the thumb of her French boyfriend, that relinquishing responsibility to him gave her the unimaginable freedom to commit violent crimes without any guilt at all.My turn.How old were you when you first realized your mommy wasn't like all the other mommies? Seven.Were you ashamed? And frightened.It's my turn.How old were you when your father first molested you? It's the only explanation for your intense hatred for men.The murders in Thailand were an attempt to correct the tragedy of your childhood.To punish your abuser, absolving yourself of guilt by using a man to k*ll other men.And not that you think much of women either, but since your mother was too scared and too drunk, too self-absorbed - No.- To protect you.None of those things happened.None of those things are true.No, that's why you can't form connections.That's why you use sex as an exercise in self-hatred.That's why when you came back from Thailand you supported yourself with prostitution, didn't you, Nicole? I am Elizabeth Hitchens.I am a professor of literature at No.No! When I met you, you wanted me to know who you truly were.How smart, how funny, how charming you are.You wanted me to know you, Nicole Wallace.The sparkling little girl who survived horrible abuse with her wits intact.Professor Hitchens.Nicole.I was retained by the university to represent you.The federal court has issued a writ of habeas corpus ordering your immediate release.I advise you to leave with me.Now, please.That foundation that you asked me about in Melbourne, it was the George Hurstwood Foundation.Come on.I'm sorry, Detective.There was nothing I could do.No, the foundation, it's called the New Covenant Foundation.Why did she say the George Hurstwood? She was trying to tell me something? George Hurstwood.Well, it's Sister Carrie.It's a novel by Theodore Dreiser.George Hurstwood was a saloonkeeper who stole money from his boss' safe.Nicole used the name of a thief to I need to call Melbourne.Okay.Thank you.Yes, we'll be back in touch.The Melbourne police recently started investigating the financial affairs of the New Covenant Foundation.They suspect that five years ago $400,000 were embezzled by the then-president of the foundation.Elizabeth Hitchens.The real Elizabeth Hitchens.Nicole Wallace stole the identity of an embezzler.I'm sure she didn't know it at the time.She found out when she heard about the investigation.She knew the Australians would catch up to her in England.They'd extradite her back home.That's why she wants US citizenship.Because non-violent financial crimes aren't covered by US extradition treaties.If she became a citizen, the Australians couldn't touch her.She's not a citizen yet.She's gone.I came here, the door was open, her things were gone.I'll call the airports.What did you think, she'd have scones and a glass of sherry for us?
02x04 - Best DefenseQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:16In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.Sir, everything all right? Yes, sure, Officer, I'm fine.Peter Bonham.New York District Attorney's office.We're here to interview a witness.Where's your witness? He's a no-show.You gentlemen be careful.Yes, sir.Now can we go? - Too bad he didn't show up.- Hmm.He was probably scared off.I should've gone by myself.I could've put three more burglary raps on Walters.Peter, do you need a feather in your cap that badly? Excuse me.Hello? Yes, who's this? What? Oh, my God.Well, where How is Yes, yes, yes, I'm writing it down.I will.Did you call 911? I'll be there.Just, please, call 911.It's Linda.- They said she passed out.- Where? Some tenement uptown, she was meeting a pro bono client, they can't wake her.They found my number in her wallet.They called you before they called 911? It doesn't sound right.You should try calling her on your cell phone.Linda? Oh, thank God.Where are you? I'll explain later.I'll see you at home.She was having lunch at Chanterelle.That is really weird.Maybe not.What are you talking about? The phantom witness.Now this phone call.No.No.It's just probably some stupid prank.Who do you think is doing this? Someone you prosecuted? Maybe it was one of your old clients, maybe they feel you didn't argue their case with enough zeal? Mommy? Mommy, I made you a drawing.Oh, sweetie, that is beautiful! It's your office, Mommy.And that's me.Can you draw a picture with you in Daddy's office? No.Your office is yucky.Well, Sara, if you draw me a nice picture, I'll put it in my office and then it won't be so yucky.Okay.Mommy, come help me.Okay.The seats are right behind the dugout.Linda's at a trial attorney's convention in San Francisco that week.I have to be with Sara.Ah, just bring her.You know, you could stuff her full of hot dogs.I'll see you tomorrow.Shut up, you do.Mr.Bonham, what happened? Are you okay? Yeah, yeah.The brakes, I couldn't stop.You said the brakes? Yeah.I kept pressing down but nothing happened.What are you doing? I know something about cars.No wonder your brakes didn't work.Somebody punched a hole in your brake line.Law & Order CI The lines had been perforated so the brakes would go out on your way home.I take the FDR home.I could've been k*lled.Do you drive your car to work every day? Oh, just Wednesdays.I pick up my daughter at her swimming lessons.I take her out for Chinese food.Did you trace the address of that tenement uptown? It was an abandoned building.I can't believe Ron, if you hadn't told me to call Linda on her cell phone, I The no-show witness, who did he have information on? Eric Walters.Walters is looking at two-to-four on a simple burglary.Until we know what's what, I'd like to post a patrol car in front of your home.No.I don't want to alarm my family.Anyway, Linda's out of town this week in San Francisco.I'll send Sara to stay with her grandmother.That still leaves you.I have a carry permit for it.I do not intend to be a sitting duck.His list of cases, larcenies, fraud, possession.All low-profile nonviolent crimes.I take it he's not one of your starters.Peter may not be the most brilliant prosecutor in our office, but right now he's the one in the most danger.Let me know what you find out.Rikers Island Correctional Facility Thursday, April 18 I got no beef with Mr.Bonham.He's got his job and I got mine.What's that, burglary, accessory to m*rder? I don't get with no m*rder.Someone used your name to lure Bonham to a phony meeting at Hunts Point.That's like saying somebody picked his name out of a phone book.Hey, man, Mr.Bonham gets k*lled, I don't see it helps my case.Does it? Eric, be quiet.It was nice talking to you.I wonder how many other inmates have asked the same question.If a prosecutor dies during a case? No inmate's asked for information on that specific question.What about the legal issues it would raise? Most likely the right to a speedy trial.A Sixth Amendment issue.Everybody here wants to know about the Sixth Amendment.Big caseload, Counselor? I'm just working on my own case.Really? You were charged with r*pe? You're researching People v.Williams.That's all about a defendant's access to a victim's sexual history.What do you want, Detective? Have any inmates asked you about the legal impact of a prosecutor's untimely death? That would be privileged information.There's no privilege for jailhouse lawyers.I can make the argument there is if the client had an expectation his communications with me would remain confidential.Oh, brother.No, actually, Eames, he has a very good point.But in this case, rule 1.6 of the ABA Code of Conduct would apply.Even if the client told me of an impending crime, the code doesn't impose any affirmative obligation on me.It's my call.And the code also says a lawyer must refrain from morally reprehensible conduct.Since you have discretion to breach the privilege, not doing so when a life is at stake is morally reprehensible.Artie Kahn.He made bail last week.You called my lawyer, right? We talked to your other lawyer.Other lawyer? The one in Rikers.The one you told you were going to whack your prosecutor, Peter Bonham.I never told him that.I just asked what would happen if Bonham up and d*ed.And you said it just like that, out of intellectual curiosity? Yeah, out of that.It just so happens, somebody's been trying to k*ll Bonham.They cut the brakes on his car.- No way.- Yeah.Whoever did this would've gotten brake fluid on their hands.Brake fluid leaves a residue.No matter how much you wash, - you can't get it off.- You can't see it either.You know what this is? It's a towelette thing.It's a special towelette thing.It has a liquid on it that reacts with brake fluid residue.If you have any brake fluid residue on your hands, it shows up.Go ahead, Artie.Wipe your hands.I didn't cut no brake line.Then why the questions about Bonham dropping dead? Because two weeks ago I was at Rikers, on the phone, and there was a guy on the phone next to me, talking about Bonham having an accident.Is it this guy? I didn't really look, you know.I had my back to the guy.You were listening.What did he say, his exact words? He was gonna pay good money for Bonham to have an accident.A permanent accident.Did you know that they're sh**ting chicken eggs through a shower head, boiling it, mixing it with sea brine and calling it caviar? Hello, everybody? Ah, our dedicated civil servant.Honey, the play starts in 45 minutes.I'll just change shirts.Oh, a Detective Goren called you.He said he tried you at the office, but you had already left.I'll call him tomorrow.Something wrong? Well, I can't find the Pomerol.I asked you to bring it up this morning.I thought you said any old Merlot.Could you be a sweetheart and get it from the cellar? - Sure.- Okay.We found the best place to buy caviar.In Istanbul.Have you been? No.We're always wanting to travel, but with Peter's busy schedule I came down to get a bottle of wine.I was about to turn the corner when I heard a noise.He sh*t at me.I I sh*t back.He was trying to k*ll me.There's one round missing.Serial number's been filed off.I got burglary tools in here.Lock-pick set, diamond chisels, cordless drill, the guy was trying to make it look like a burglary gone bad.This is what we're supposed to think he was after.Gary Burke.Work ID.Bartender downtown.He's gonna be late.Burke was feeling lucky.Stopped by the OTB this afternoon.Must be a couple grand's worth of bets here.Check the locks for lubricant.Both sides of the door.Yes, sir.Just covering all the bases.Do you use the basement door often? No.I think the lock's rusted.Oh, well, it's working fine now.Well, of course it's working.This man's a burglar.He knows how to open locks.Why assume he's a burglar? Well, he came for the safe.Didn't you see it? We did.What do you keep in there? Nothing.It came with the house.We only lock it because of Sara.Well, how would a burglar know about it? Oh, we've had workers down there.They always ask about it.But you don't think it was a burglary.No, but he brought burglary tools with him, maybe to help with the cover story.Cover story? What do you mean? We have an ID on the intruder.Gary Burke.Either of you ever seen him before? No./ You ever prosecute him? He has a long rap sheet, muggings, drug possession.No burglary.No, I don't recognize him.You didn't answer my question.What's going on here? Someone's put a contract out on your husband's life.You can't be serious! The phone call, the car, it's all It's all part of it.Oh, my God, Peter.But he's okay now, right? I mean, he's safe.It depends on how determined this person is.And we have no way of knowing that.Home of Gary Burke Queens, New York Friday, April 19 Mr.Sanchez, what are they doing here? They're cops.Lori lives here with Gary.Where's Gary? He's gotten himself into trouble.What trouble? The trouble somebody gave him a lot of money to get into.I don't know about any money.The two grand he spent at the OTB? The three grand you spent on new dresses, new shoes, new handbags.Gary saved up his bar tips.You're really good at keeping secrets.Me, I just run off at the mouth.For example, I'll probably tell Gary that you were out all evening.Gary knows I was with my friends.Look at your hair.It looks like you just walked out of the shower.I know I'm gonna say something to Gary about your hair.I went to the gym.I took a shower there.Really? They let you smoke cigars at the gym? Because you smell like cigar smoke! I know I'll just blurt that out to Gary.Gee, Lori, thanks to my partner's big mouth, Gary might get the impression you're fooling around with some guy who smokes cigars and lets you use his shower.Please, don't tell him that.He'll hit me.Okay.Let's go from the top.Where did the money come from? I don't know.Gary got a lot of calls from this buddy of his in prison.JoJo Martinez.Please, you can't tell Gary I said anything.I don't think you have to worry about Gary anymore.Gary Burke was apprehended while trying to sh**t one of my colleagues, Peter Bonham.Mr.Burke hasn't yet decided to cooperate with us, but we'd like to give your client first cr*ck at a plea.A plea? Why? You think he's involved? Yes, we do.Of course, if he'd rather wait for Mr.Burke to implicate him Give me a minute to talk to my client Vince, shut up.They're playing you.Gary Burke is dead.How do you know that? PNN, Prison News Network.That's the same place we get our news from.Yeah.One of their reporters heard you on the phone a couple of weeks ago putting out a contract on Bonham.Screw that.Why would I want to hurt that man? Because he's about to put you away for life? You're facing your third felony drug conviction.Bonham told us he turned you down for a plea bargain.That's hardly a motive for m*rder.I don't need to k*ll this DA to b*at this rap.JoJo, let me handle Don't "JoJo" me.- The hell with all of you.- That's a nice What you're wearing.I mean, where'd you get that from? Is that from Peru? What do they call that? A serap A serape.No, it's a S-s-s- Sweater.It's a sweater.Right.Somebody make that for you? I was reviewing Mr.Martinez's case file, and I noticed you missed a filing deadline on a motion to suppress drug evidence.He specifically asked me not to file it.- And why would he do that? - I don't know.I tried to talk to his mother about it.What does she have to do with it? She's paying his legal bills.Or I should say, she was.She stopped three weeks ago.But I still have to do what Martinez says.It sounds like JoJo's getting ready to cut him loose.That only makes sense if he's trading up for a better lawyer.Better lawyers cost more than $200 a week.It begs the question where is Mr.Martinez getting the money to pay for better representation? Same place Gary Burke got his money? JoJo's mom might know.I don't know anything about a new lawyer.I just do what my son tells me.He asked you to stop paying Mr.Quitoriano? I just got behind, that's all.You made JoJo's sweater.He was wearing it when we were talking to him.It's a nice-looking sweater.This one's even more stunning.Eames, look at the sleeve.This raglan sleeve is laid in so effortlessly.Under the seam, at the armpit, it's like a little pouch? I see it.You can hide something in there.Hmm, and there's another one in this sleeve.Just big enough for messages, money, dr*gs.You don't tell us the truth, you could have your visiting privileges revoked.Please, it was just messages.What was in those messages? Were they about the new lawyer? I don't look.But JoJo did get a new lawyer.How is he paying for it? He said it wouldn't cost anything.That the lawyer would work for free.He said she's the best.The new lawyer's a woman.What's her name? I don't know.JoJo said she can fix everything when she gets back from California.All right, Mrs.Martinez.Thank you.And no more sweaters, okay? Bonham's wife was supposed to be in San Francisco next week.JoJo's new lawyer.JoJo's payback for having her husband k*lled.Talk about pro bono.Oh, hi, sweetheart.I didn't know you knew Alfonzo.John? Just from court.He was just asking me about the sh**ting, so Oh.I have a hearing in an hour.Do you wanna get lunch? Peter, can I talk to you? The police suspect Martinez is connected to this attempt on your life.Their suspicions are completely without merit, of course, but, regardless, I want you to recuse yourself from Martinez's drug case.That's not necessary.I can remain objective.Who are you kidding? They think he tried to have you k*lled.Linda, could you explain to your husband why he should Don't talk to her! You wanna have me relieved, make an application.Unless a judge tells me, I am not stepping down.Peter, I don't think that he was being unreasonable.Can we just get lunch? I can't, actually, I have a deposition at 1:00.So, I'll see you tonight.Linda Bonham's involvement would explain how Gary Burke got into their house using a door with a rusted lock.Not to mention, she was working hard to sell the burglary cover story.She's one of the most respected trial attorneys in the city.She is married to a second-rate prosecutor.She may be ready to trade up to something better.That's what divorces are for.She's the bread-winner, she'd end up paying him alimony.Until you present me with incontrovertible proof that she's involved, I will not be applying for warrants, issuing subpoenas nor presenting evidence to a grand jury.I will not embarrass Peter Bonham.Home of Jerry & Allison Selwyn Wednesday, April 24 So, Linda sent poor Peter down to the cellar to fetch the Pomerol and that's when the b*ll*ts started flying.It was her idea to send him down there? Yes.How well did you know the Bonhams? Oh, not well.I met Linda at a brunch.We had common interests.Linda Bonham's interest is in the fact that Allison's sister is on the board of the Canterbury School.She's trying to get her daughter admitted.I already told her they live far too east of Park Avenue to stand a chance of being admitted.Being partner in her law firm doesn't count for anything? Well, some law partnerships are forged in the courtroom, some in the boardroom And the bedroom? Oh, Jerry, knock it off.Oh, no, please, my partner loves rumor and innuendo.Don't take my word for it.Ask Rodney Brooks.He's a litigator at Linda's old law firm, and I'm told that he was one of her stepping stones two years ago.I was a jerk, okay? Linda had just moved to a new firm and made partner.People were envious, they were taking sh*ts at her She slept her way to the top, that sort of thing? Right.So, one night at the cigar club, I don't know, I had one Gibson too many, I made up a story.You know, like I said, I was a jerk.Linda's successful because she is smart and ambitious.Okay? You handle civil lawsuits, right? Ms.Bonham ever work with you? Sometimes.She's good at prepping witnesses.I work mostly with expert witnesses.But ordinary citizens who've never been on the stand before, Linda was the best.You ever work with a witness named JoJo Martinez? I wouldn't remember.He stuttered.That rings a bell.Sure, about four years ago, a landlord-tenant suit.I don't remember the guy's name, but Linda helped him get over his stutter.Could you dig up a file on him by tomorrow? - We could send someone over.- Oh, sure.Martinez's hesitation before words starting with the letter "S"? It's the mark of a former stutterer.That's his name on the witness list for the lawsuit.That's how he knows Ms.Bonham.That's how she came to hire him to k*ll her husband in return for money and future legal representation.The floor is yours, Mr.Quitoriano.You send me an offer in writing, my client will make a statement.I'm sure it's just routine.You know how the police They questioned our friends, my colleagues, they're trading in gossip, it's humiliating.If you weren't one of the best defense attorneys in the city, they wouldn't be doing this to you.They're doing it to you, too, Peter.Your own people! I doubt the DA's office is even aware that Is Ms.Bonham home? What do you want? Linda Bonham, we have a warrant for your arrest.What? What possible grounds could you have? I wanna see the warrant.Put your hands behind your back, please.For God's sake, is that necessary? It's for her own protection.Peter, it doesn't matter.Just call Bill Stanton, tell him what's happening, and tell Sara that I am at work.She'll be at the Major Case Squad.You're insane to think that I would ever hurt Peter.The insanity is you thinking you'd get away with it.But I have no motive! I'm sure we'll find it, maybe in one of these.All your electronic gizmos.Maybe we'll find a boyfriend's number or a message that you forgot to delete.You know what confounds me? With all these gizmos, people still think they can get away with m*rder.What's more confounding is sometimes they do.Your phone has a display for caller ID? Yes.When you get a call, you check the display before answering it? Yes.I don't understand what You screen your calls.Excuse us a minute.Peter Bonham got a call that his wife had passed out, the call to lure him to the abandoned building.He called her to see if she was all right.He called her on her cell phone.His number would've been displayed on her phone.She would've seen it was him calling.If she was really involved in a scheme to lure him to his death She wouldn't have answered her phone.That's right, she wouldn't.But she did.Because she didn't know about any scheme.It's him.He's framing her.He wants to get rid of her.Divorce is out of the question, he wouldn't get a dime.And he can't have her k*lled, he'd be the obvious suspect.But he can send her to jail for life.So far it's working, all the evidence points to her.It won't be easy to get him.He can't know we're on to him.Martinez said he got $20,000 to arrange the hit on Peter Bonham.We just wanna trace it to Linda Bonham.Just dotting all the "I's." Let me know what you come up with.How long are we keeping him in the dark? Until we have an incontrovertible case against Peter Bonham.Starting with tracing the 20,000 back to him.I'm just finding the usual checks, groceries, mortgage, doctor.Which doctor? A Dr.David Kipper on Park Avenue.He was writing him checks every month.Yeah.I've got 11 charges on Bonham's credit card to Kipper in the last year.Look at the deposits made to the Bonham's account.Just the same amount every couple of weeks.Probably paychecks.Bonham's covered under the same city medical plan we are.He pays the doctor, the insurance company sends him a reimbursement check.Well, there's no record he deposited those checks.She's finally asleep.Maybe we should have her stay up at my mother's.I'm worried that she'll hear things at her school.It's pre-school, Linda.They talk about Sponge Bob, not stuff like this.Peter, if you want me to sleep in the guest room, I'll understand.No, no.Don't be silly.Sweetheart, I need to tell you this.I have never cheated on you.Never.You know that, don't you? Sure, of course.And the police said that I was ashamed of you.I mean, that's just not true.I have always admired you for what you do.You don't have to say anything.And when I made partner, I was happy for us, it just meant that our life would be better.And Sara's.The insurance company says two years ago Bonham stopped depositing the reimbursement checks and started just cashing them.He's been hoarding the money.- How much are we talking about? - About $25,000.All from routine doctor's visits, check-ups, little aches and pains.He's used his insurance money to build a w*r chest to frame his wife.Two years ago Bonham won a conviction over George Kolinsky for a drug case.Kolinsky got 20 years.Hired a new lawyer and appealed.The conviction was overturned, most of the charges were set aside.Kolinsky ended up serving a year.- All thanks to his new lawyer.- Linda Bonham.The guy's a prosecutor.He knows losing a case is part of the game.There's losing.And then there's losing to your wife.And then there's getting your balls handed to you on a platter.His wife had just made partner, there were rumors of infidelities.The guy stayed with her for two years, sleeping in the same bed, just waiting for payback? This guy's a poster boy for passive-aggressive personality disorder.He doesn't confront his wife, he doesn't argue with her, he doesn't contradict her.Instead he uses us, the police, the DA's office to nail her.It's time we let Mr.Carver know he's prosecuting the wrong person.We can't tell him without Bonham finding out.You want me to keep Carver out of the loop? Okay.We'll tell him when we're ready.Any idea when that will be? Bonham's done a great job of burying his wife.There is someone who might be able to help us dig her out.JoJo Martinez.My client laid everything out in his statement.He called Miss Bonham twice.That's when she told him what she wanted.She sent the money to his mother, and Gary Burke collected his share from Mrs.Martinez.How did you know when to call Miss Bonham? She s-s-sent the notes to my mother with the phone number and when to call.The notes your mother sewed into the sweaters? My mother didn't know what was going down.The number you called, you still have it? No.It was different numbers both times.C-c-cell phone numbers.How did you know it was Ms.Bonham that you were talking to? I mean, did you recognize her voice? No.She just s-s-said who she was.And it was the same lady both times? I guess.I don't know.The s-s-second time she called she said she had a cold.Was there any chit-chat or just business? Just business.She told me what she wanted me to do and that was that.The numbers he called were probably prepaid cell phones.Untraceable.And the woman he talked to? Most likely two different women.Most likely prostitutes Bonham hired for the occasion.The times the calls were made corresponded to times when Linda Bonham was home alone.With no verifiable alibi.Bonham thought of everything.What's that? It's Martinez's statement.I'm improving it.Three calls? Didn't you just tell me Martinez made two calls? Well, now he's made three.I need to get this re-typed.Don't expect me to beg for a plea bargain for something that I didn't do! Miss Bonham, I'm offering this out of consideration I'm innocent.I know you hear it from defendants all the time, but I am innocent.We have Mr.Martinez's statement.He says he talked to you.It's just not true.Let's show her the statement.It's on the second page when he talks about the phone calls.He lists the calls, date and time.If there's anyone who can verify you didn't get the calls, tell us.Well, these first two, I might have been alone.But this third one, I remember this Sunday, I was with Peter.We went to Connecticut for a drive.- You sure? - Yes, yes.We talked about getting a summer rental.We even got lobster rolls at a food stand.Ask Peter.I did not get a phone call.This whole thing is a pack of lies.Well, we'll certainly look into it, Ms.Bonham.Why not ask Peter right now? Yes, ask him! Please, just ask him.It's Ron.Could you come down to the office? Yeah, thank you.This date here.It's a Sunday.That's one of the times Martinez said he talked to your wife.Do you remember where you were that afternoon? I was with Sara in Central Park.With Linda? No.She stayed home.So, you weren't in Connecticut? Peter, don't you remember? We stopped to eat right outside of Guilford.Ms.Bonham, I'm sorry.Peter, what's the matter? You have to remember.- Linda, let's go.- No.- Peter.- Linda, please.We dug for clams with Sara.Oh, my God, no, you You son of a bitch, you That's enough, Linda.Oh, my God! How could you? I need to Now she knows.She knows it was you.What's he talking about? What are you talking about, Detective? Well, you just couldn't resist.Resist what? Letting his wife know that he's the one who framed her.What? That's not true.Martinez never said that he called your wife that Sunday.That was me.I revised the statement.The truth is, is Linda was in Connecticut with you.Not only did you stop for food, you stopped for gas.$12 worth.It's right here on his credit card bill.Maybe you forgot.Maybe you didn't.But you could either confirm your wife's alibi or confirm Martinez's statement.It's a tough choice.Oh, I see.It was brilliant, Peter.You put that little wife of yours in her place.Her and her big salary, her successful law practice.All the things that she accomplished with no regard for you, for your Your feelings.When she took the Kolinsky appeal, how did she rationalize it? Did she tell you that there were important constitutional issues at stake? And when she b*at you, did she go "Aw, shucks, honey, it's not personal." Who was she kidding? It was personal.She crushed you.And not in the privacy of your own home but in a courtroom.In front of your colleagues, in front of the whole legal community.Not only that, it's on the damn record.There.Where law students, lawyers, judges, your friends and neighbors can read about it from now until eternity.Everyone knew.Everyone.They would look at her and then they look at me.My own daughter looks at me like I'm some kind of a joke.Well, you showed her, didn't you? Peter Bonham, you're under arrest for m*rder.How long had you suspected? Only a few days.We couldn't take the risk of him finding out.Please, no explanations.I've got to first deal with Peter Bonham.But I will get back to you, Detective.He'll get over it.Just like Peter Bonham.
02x05 - ChinoiserieQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:17In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.The paper isn't dark enough.It looks too new.What? What is it? It's not good enough.It has to be good enough.It is good! It is exactly the same! Don't argue with me.Didn't you listen? It has to be darker.- I like the red one.- That one? The pink one, the pink one! All right, the pink one.Listen, listen! Look, I'm the expert, and I say the work is good.Go get the car.Thank you.Come on, little one.Somebody stop him, please! Tiananmen! Tiananmen! Tiananmen! So, who is she? It doesn't matter.She recognized you.We have to do something.No one will listen to her.Just go! Thank you for watching them.- You all right? - Yes, thank you.It was someone I thought I knew.It's me.I need to talk to you, okay? We're all fine, John.Just call me as soon as you hear this.Come on, little ones.Everything's fine.We're going home now.Come.We'll go see Daddy.He'll make everything fine.Mommy.Mommy.Mommy.Mommy.Mommy.Law & Order CI Her name's Annie Ming Littleton.Two in the back, right in front of her kids.The GSR pattern's tight.The sh**t couldn't have been more than two feet away.One of the witnesses clocked the sh*ts at 3:06.She made a call at 2:56 to a number programmed in her phone.Someone named John.Could be her husband, John Littleton.He's over there with the kids.He's hooked up with the Feds.Yeah, his father is with the Treasury Department.That's why we got called in.She'd been shopping.I was in a meeting.Annie wanted me to call her back right away.She sounded upset, but she said that she and the kids were fine.Was she downtown for any special reason? Just to shop.Annie liked the energy in Chinatown.It reminded her of home.Beijing.Pink's my favorite color.Did Mommy buy this for you? Before she called Daddy? Where did she buy it? At the store.Then Mommy ran away.Do you know why she ran away? No.She ran down the street.She was shouting.And then she came back.Mommy is sleeping now.She say, "Fa pi chi saran." Something like that.And then she run."Fa pi chi saran"? What does that mean? I don't know.You know why? She yelled in Mandarin.- And you speak Cantonese.- Yes.Thanks.That's her.I told the officer that this lady almost knocked me down.She was shouting and chasing somebody.Did you get a look at who it was? No.What was she shouting? I didn't understand.Nobody understood.And then she yelled in English, "Stop him." And then she said, "Tiananmen." "Tiananmen?" Yeah, Tiananmen.Over and over."Tiananmen, Tiananmen." And then people understood.I'll bet they did.I met Annie in Beijing in the spring of '92.I had an internship with the State Department.How did you meet? She was She was a student.How often do you go back to China? Annie's parents still live in Beijing.We try to go at least once a year.How's your Mandarin? Must be pretty good.It's all right.What does "Fa pi chi saran" mean to you? I don't know."Fa pi chi saran." Your wife was yelling it at the person she was chasing.I don't know.Mr.Littleton, we think you do know."Fa pi chi saran," it means "screaming k*ller." Doesn't it? She was in Tiananmen.Wasn't she? She saw what happened there in '89 to the students? We're not allowed to talk about it.Is that some kind of condition how she was allowed to leave China? I'll never be able to take my children back if they know I talked.It stays in this room, Mr.Littleton.Annie told me that the PLA, the People's Army, just fired into crowds of unarmed students.The ones they didn't k*ll right away, they crushed under their tanks."Fa pi chi saran." That's what the students called one of the officers because he was a screamer.Screaming, "sh**t, sh**t, sh**t!" A butcher.Half the Chinese immigrants in New York City served in the People's Liberation Army.It's the Chinese army.It's compulsory m*llitary service.It's not exactly illegal.This character was an officer during the m*ssacre of students, the State Department doesn't keep records of folks like that? Neither we nor the Chinese government consider what the PLA did to be illegal.I deplore Ms.Littleton's death, I hope you find her k*ller, but I'm sorry, I can't help you.You already have.He was helpful to you? Yes.If it's not illegal to be a screaming butcher in Tiananmen Square, then why did our guy run? It's just a few more days, Lucille.They've cleared the border.I mean, isn't that right, Pang? It's just that it's never been like this before, Stuart.You know it hasn't.Liam, tell him.It's the papers we're concerned about.The papers are fine.It's just that it's so much money.And then there's all this mystery.What are you saying, Lucille? I'm saying I'm uncomfortable.The price stands.Would you excuse us for just a minute? I can't If we just offer her a slight discount.I see how you handle things.Every unhappy woman terrifies you.The price stands.She stand right there, looking at the vests.What was she doing when she saw him? She pay for the vest.She put change in her purse.Was she holding her purse? Did she have it on her shoulder? On her shoulder.Here.So she would have turned this way to put her change away.So right here she said, "Fa pi chi saran"? Yes.That's when she saw him.Across the street.Yes.She run across the street.She was sure it was the right guy? She got a good look at him? Full face, not in profile? He wasn't just walking by.No, he came out of the doorway.The windows, the second floor.The old man move in three weeks ago.Looks like this old man already moved out.He sign a lease? No, no lease.He paid cash.Two months in advance.He ever have visitors? Good-looking young guy.Chinese.Sometimes he's with a white guy, not so good-looking.That's all I know.How about yesterday afternoon, 3:00? Yeah, they both here.Eames.Aha.Illegal baking.Baking documents.The old man's a forger.Forging what? Passports? Something worth more than passports.Something worth a life.This good-looking guy k*lled Ms.Littleton because he was worried about getting hooked up to fake ID's? He was probably worried about another kind of document.Now, what am I looking at? A Chinese jigsaw puzzle? The lab says it's standard 30 weight, good quality rag paper.But it's been aged.Soaked in tea and mineral oil and then baked.This bit of red is wax.Probably to imitate an official seal or stamp.But that's not the most interesting part.This type of calligraphy, the elongated character, the sharp brush strokes, is in the lmperial style of early Qing Dynasty, 18th century.It evolved from the "thin gold" calligraphy developed by the Emperor Huizong.He got that off his box of Wheaties this morning.Actually, the curator of the Chinese galleries at the Met.I faxed him a copy of it.This curator have an idea who might've written this? Hsu Calligraphy Studio Brooklyn, New York Wednesday, June 6 Calligraphy is one of the great achievement of the Chinese people.But our children do not study it.They told us at the Met you were the best practitioner of it on the East Coast.Thank you.Is this really that hard to do? Because it doesn't look that hard.Do you think that I could Pick it up? If you study hard, sure.Which is the easiest style? Is it this one? That's Han Confucian form of style.Very old.Not so easy.I like this.Do a lot of people write in this style? Yeah, the Flowing Grass style.I know maybe 10 people who are very good.And this one? How many people here have mastered this one? Not many.The lmperial Classic style.The most difficult.But you've mastered it? Yes.And you know everyone that has.For example, do you know what person did this? I don't know who did it.Maybe it's the same person who did this scroll.No.I did this.Every stroke has the personality of the writer.His energy and vitality.An expert could compare the two and find that they were done by the same person.And that expert could trace the writing to the brush that you used.We need to know who hired you to do this, Mr.Hsu.I don't know his name.But he know my nephew's name in Ningpo.I can't say no.This man is PLA.What did he have you write? "The Court of Emperor Qianlong "welcomes esteemed guest Lord Pembridge "and request that he accept this gift "from the lmperial Bronze Collection." Did he say what it was for? No explanation.Just write and take it to the Hotel St.Francis and leave it at the desk for room 516.Room 516? That would be Mr.Pembridge's room.Mr.Pembridge? Actually, he calls himself the Fifth Lord Pembridge.Would he be in his room? I just saw him a couple of minutes ago heading for the sundry store.He has an ascot.You can't miss him.Lord Pembridge? Could we speak to you for a minute? Well Dear, I don't know what for.It's about some packages that were delivered to you.Packages? I wouldn't know anything about packages.Where are you from, Lord Pembridge? From? Ah, my family's estate is just outside a little town called Leeds.A little town called Leeds? And what's the purpose of your visit here? - Pleasure.And friends.- What friends? Oh, well, I just had a dinner from Mick and the boys.Sent them off on their world tour.And then I saw Gwynnie and Hugh.Lovely people, just lovely.Cut it out.Isn't that the worst English accent you've ever heard? Next to the Irish Spring guy, it's the worst accent, period.I beg your pardon.The mishmash of Cockney, Welsh.But miraculously, I think I heard a shred of the north of England in one of your "R's." There are so many sounds in there, how can you tell? Really, you are absurd.I don't think he's trained.Well, of course I'm trained.With Strasberg himself.I suppose you went to Yale.Now, are we gonna play this or what? No, we're gonna play this.Is that a real g*n? Oh, my God, you're really cops, aren't you? "George Weems." What it says here on your SAG card.- You look familiar.- My last gig.I was the plump and happy raisin in a snack food commercial.- Am I in trouble? - You tell us.You checked into a hotel under an assumed name.Forged papers were delivered to your room.An associate of yours is suspected of murdering a woman.You don't look so plump and happy now, George.No, I didn't know anything about a m*rder.I I was just hired to play a part, that's all.Hired by whom? I don't know.I never met the guy.He called me.He said his name was Jean.That he saw me in this Gilbert and Sullivan thing, and that he wanted me to play some Brit Eurotrash, Lord Pembridge.For what? A movie? Performance art.Improvisational.Who were the other actors? I don't know.I was meeting them today.Where was this performance to take place? In real settings.They were picking me up and driving out to JFK, and it was gonna go from there.Jean said they had a room for me at the St.Francis.That if anybody asked, I was Lord Pembridge.And you thought that we were part of the performance.Yes.It never occurred to you that something illegal was afoot? I'm an actor.I'm constantly broke.It was a couple of nights at the St.Francis.It sounded like fun.Fantastic.What was the scene at JFK? Lord Pembridge picks up a piece of art from the cargo department.A family heirloom.That's it? One scene? No, no, there were two scenes.Lord Pembridge delivers the heirloom to some posh apartment on Fifth Avenue.Department of U.S Customs JFK International Airport Thursday, June 7 Here it is.One crate, household items.Consignee, Lord Robert Pembridge.He picked it up this morning.This morning? Yeah, this morning.- Did he show ID? - Yes.And he had the waybill.It was all in order.I don't need any more grief about this.What other grief did you get? Two guys came in a couple of hours ago.I told them Pembridge already picked it up, and I thought they were gonna have a heart att*ck.Especially that white guy.- And the other guy? - Chinese.But then they said they must've gotten their signals crossed with Lord Pembridge, and they left.This extra charge, what's that? A re-crating charge slapped on by the freight forwarder.It says the amount was charged to an existing account.The freight forwarder can tell you whose account that is.I'm deadly serious.I need an answer right away.Someone's here.Let me get rid of them.Are you Stuart Gaston? Yes.I'm sorry, I'm very busy right now.- Too busy for us? - I have a kind of a situation.How can I help you? Your account number turned up on the waybill for a shipment from Hong Kong addressed to a Lord Pembridge.Oh.I don't see how that's possible.I don't know any Lord Pembridge.Do you have a copy of the waybill? Thanks.Yeah, I do have an account with this company, but I certainly didn't ship any household items.They must've jumbled the numbers.This must be some kind of situation you got on your hands.Why do you say that? Well, you've loosened your tie, you got a drink on your desk, you got three phone lines blinking, and you're chewing the inside of your cheeks like some kind of frantic chipmunk.Are you under a lot of stress? You lost something.No.I don't know No, I think you lost something in transit, didn't you? I'm sorry, you're wrong.It's late and I need to close up.Thank you for bringing that billing mistake to my attention.He smuggled that piece into the country, and someone stole it right out from under his nose.Don't look so happy.The obvious move is that Stuart Gaston's Chinese partner had an accomplice pick up the package on the sly.Well, that's all fine and good, but we have no leverage against Gaston to make him give up his Chinese partner.No evidence he's involved in smuggling, no idea even what it is he's smuggling.It's a Chinese antique.A bronze.- A fake? - No.If it were, they wouldn't go through all this trouble to smuggle it into the country.What's being faked is the documentation, the provenance.Because it's probably stolen.Have you checked with Interpol? They have no record of any theft of major Chinese art.That leaves one possibility.That it was stolen from an archeological dig in China.A Chinese national treasure, and Gaston found a buyer for it.We find that buyer, maybe we find evidence against Mr.Gaston.Banfield Auction House Monday, June 11 Well, I'd guess that the piece in question dates from the Han Dynasty, First century AD.It's most likely a funereal piece.Why would you think that? Well, of all the bronzes, it would be the most valuable.Otherwise, why go to all the trouble? No, a rare and important and legal piece can fetch easily 1.5 million.Three million, if it's a smuggled piece.But that's a risky business.You know all the collectors that Stuart Gaston usually deals with.Which one would risk it? For a special piece? Most of them would take the risk, otherwise they wouldn't be collectors.How about just the ones who can afford to lay out three million in cash? I'd be hard pressed to say.Are any of the collectors holding off? - Careful.- Oh, sorry.You know, holding off making acquisitions? Building up a cash reserve? Well, I can't speak for every auction house.Come on.We know you compare notes.Why don't we take this outside? I'd be happy to get you both a cup of coffee.There's a cafe.We could talk about it I'll bet you this camel that you all know who's buying and who's not.You think about that.I'm gonna have a look at the other, you know, lovely stuff that you have No, wait.You know, there is Lucille Mobray.She's one of Gaston's regulars.I haven't purchased anything recently because I haven't seen anything worth buying.This moon vase is stunning.I've read about the lmperial ceramic factory in Jingdezhen.Was it made there? Yes.It's from the collection of Pere D'Entrecolles himself.I love this teapot.Is it old? Three thousand years old.How'd you get interested in Chinese art? I lived in Shanghai when I was a girl.My father worked for the National City Bank.He gave me my first piece, a terracotta doll.It was a magical time.This collection, it's your legacy.Stuart Gaston help you put it together? Yes.I've always relied on Stuart.He made sure that each piece had the proper provenance, to show that it wasn't, you know, smuggled out of China yesterday.Of course.Because owning smuggled art is a violation of the National Stolen Property Act.The Chinese could go to court and have it seized.That's perfectly true.But what does that have to do with me? It has to do with Mr.Gaston.We suspect he smuggled something into the country a couple of days ago.Stuart? No, I don't think he's capable of anything like that.No, see, he's capable of it, and a lot more.And once we arrest him, he's liable to make all kinds of accusations, just to save his skin.Someone's entire collection could come under suspicion.A whole legacy tainted.I mean, no reputable dealer or auction house is gonna do business with a person like that.No more acquisitions.Of course, it's possible such a person was being duped by Mr.Gaston.We are discreet with innocent victims.If they behave like innocent victims.Stuart told me he had an exceptional piece from the Lord Pembridge estate.He assured me the provenance was well documented.What's the piece? All he told me was that it was a bronze from an Eastern Han tomb.He said that the Fifth Lord Pembridge was bringing it himself from Hong Kong.Gaston has a Chinese associate? You must mean Pang.A very crude individual.You know where we can find him? Yes.Stuart told me where he works.You'll never guess.Yes, yes, I'll take care of it.I promise.I'll call back again tomorrow.Eight o'clock your time.Hey! They're gonna charge you for that.Bad day, Mr.Pang? What a good soldier.He knows when to surrender.One down, one to go.Where's this contraband my client's accused of smuggling? Is there even a photograph? What we have is what we found in his gallery.Forged documents attesting to the object's phony provenance.It's just paper and ink.Novelties.Yeah, well, these "novelties" match materials we found in an apartment across the street from where this woman was k*lled.k*lled because she recognized your partner, Mr.Pang.Also known to his admirers as the Screaming Butcher of Tiananmen Square.Oh, you didn't know that? Oh, sorry.I didn't know you were in here.Mr.Houghton, say hello to your client's business partner, Pang Chiangji.We'll be next door.My client might have a statement to make.He sh*t that woman.She recognized him.He went back and k*lled her.I didn't even know that he did it until it was in the newspaper the next day.He k*lled her.He double-crossed me.I should never have trusted him.So ends another beautiful friendship.This being the land of second chances, Mr.Pang, you do get to tell your side of the story.My friend, an officer in the PLA, he wrote to me.He works on an excavation in the Gobi Desert.He said if we can get a piece out, people pay millions for it here.Two years it took us to get it out.I'm dishwasher here.Gaston the pig takes my future, and now I have nothing.I go back to China, they k*ll me.What do I have here? I did not sh**t this woman.She recognized me.So, so what? I told him nobody cares, but he wanted me to do something.So I left.I went home.But I didn't He's like a crocodile, lying in the water pretending he's a big lump of nothing.But then he sh**t this woman in the back.- He steals from me.- It's all lies.I didn't sh**t that woman.I don't even own a g*n.There's no evidence Mr.Pang does either.Nor is there any evidence he stole the object.Why would I steal it from him, a k*ller? What do you think, I'm crazy? Maybe you thought you could pull a fast one on some poor dishwasher.Poor dishwasher? What, Pang? No, he owns a factory in Hong Kong.You know this for a fact? No.But why would I ever get into business with a dishwasher? We searched the dump he lives in.He owns two suits, two pairs of shoes, and a clock radio.No factory.Evidently Mr.Gaston never checked his client's employment record.But someone else did.Now, tell me where you're going, Liam, in case I need to find you.I'm not terribly interested in being found right now, Lucille.I'm not liking what I'm hearing about these police.No, no, no.They think poor Stuart and that Mr.Pang did everything.It's perfectly safe.I'll make my own decisions on that, if you don't mind.You went above and beyond this time, Liam.I do appreciate that.I might try to get up into Bhutan.See what I might catch coming out of Tibet.Oh, that sounds so exciting.I'll keep you in mind.Goodbye, Liam.And thank you.Lucille Mobray a m*rder*r? My God, Carver, this is a 73-year-old woman we're talking about.A very rich 73-year-old woman who can get anything she wants done for a price.And that's your probable cause? She's rich? She knew where Mr.Pang worked.The only way she could have known was by having him followed.Look, this search warrant application can't even describe this, this, this What is this, a rice steamer? You want me to sign this, you put some meat on the plate.Can we give the man what he wants? Maybe Lucille Mobray can.Given the right performance, by the right performer.For heaven's sake, sit down.I was just being polite.You make some vague thr*at on the phone, and now you're being polite? Please.You said you had something to show me.Let's get on with it.This is the documentation for the I know what it is.What are you doing with it? It was delivered to my room at the St.Francis.I'm the person who was supposed to deliver the object to you.You? The Fifth Lord of Pembridge.This magnificent object has been in my family for 300 years.I see.Stuart thought that accent would fool me? It's a perfectly acceptable English music hall accent.What makes you think I'd want this? I did some research.The Chinese are very paranoid about people stealing national treasures.They're very litigious.So I thought this might come in useful.You expect me to pay for this? Did you know that the Chinese consulate's not very far from here, on 42nd Street? I just learned that in my research.Did you bring your checkbook? Write a check out to cash.What amount? $10,000.My grandchildren are waiting for me.Have a nice existence.Frankie, be careful.You don't wanna spill it.I want to play with my fire truck.That's fine, sweetheart, but you've just got to be careful.Hello, Ms.Mobray.That's a cool fire truck.My grandma bought it for me.Grandma got me a carriage with two horses, but I had to leave it at home.The privileges of being a grandmother.You're allowed to spoil them a little bit.Excuse me.I see that you've spread your generosity around a lot lately.Look what we have here.Forged documents.Why in the world would you spend so much money for forged documents? I thought it would be fun to have them.We think it would be fun if you accompanied these gentlemen down to our offices.Everything here is listed on her insurance declaration.Same story with the items at her storage vault.Piece isn't here.The doorman says a Liam Montgomery visited Ms.Mobray a number of times in the last few weeks.It so happens there was a Liam Montgomery registered at the St.Francis around the same time as Lord Pembridge.Probably the guy she had keeping tabs on all the players.In other news, the Captain wants to know what we've turned up here.Squat, that's what we turned up.These books and catalogues of Chinese bronzes, I want Latent to go through them, page by page.Latent Lab One Police Plaza Thursday, June 14 On these pages we have a partial thumb, index, partial palm, here, here and here.She spent a lot of time looking at these.How fresh are these prints? Well, the oils are still viscous.A couple, three days.And that one.It's beautiful."A heavenly horse with a flame-shaped forelock."Bronze horses are extremely rare." We need another search warrant.Wonderful.Another gray room.Please have a seat.Liam Montgomery.Do you know him? He runs an art consulting business out of London.Your doorman said he's made periodic visits over the last seven years.Yes, he's helped me.I'm an old woman.I'm easy pickings for the like of Gaston and Pang.I need to protect myself.And your acquisitions.Which he seems uniquely qualified to do.He has some kind of police record in Britain.If you have questions about Mr.Montgomery, ask Mr.Montgomery.He's left the country.He got the job done.But he made your dream come true.What is this, a toy? Not a toy.Your granddaughter was sorry to see it go.Detective, please, please.This is irreplaceable.Lucille.Have you ever seen anything so exquisite? To think it was made during the time of Christ.I'm prepared to be conciliatory in view of your client's age.You knew what it was before you actually saw it? Yes.Liam bribed someone in Hong Kong and snuck a peek.- He sent me a photograph.- Lucille, please.Oh, enough of the charade, Harry.They're making us an offer.Six months in a minimum security prison.A fine.A substantial fine.We'll take it, Harry.It's just to have owned it even for such a short time.Even just to look at it.The contours, the workmanship.It's so precious.There were There were two little men in the carriage? Yes, there were.Where's the other one? Well, maybe they're in here.Oh, look at this.It's Gaston and Pang.They were in Chinatown.Gaston.You know, Pang.Someone else I forgot.Oh, let's see.Annie Littleton.She was in Chinatown, too.And she saw Pang, and she screamed, "Tiananmen, Tiananmen!" Detective, please, please.Then it looked like trouble.Oh, yes.Oh! There looked like there was gonna be trouble.But don't you worry.Don't you worry.Liam Montgomery.'Cause he has his eye on things.He told you there was trouble, and he called you."There's trouble, Mrs.Mobray." And you said, "Take care of it," and he did.And bang, bang, Annie Littleton.No, I did no such thing.But But then, all hell broke loose, and Gaston and Pang, they were fighting.Pang wanted it, Gaston wanted it, Pang wanted it Stop it! This is not a joke.These are precious, precious artifacts.They're priceless, in fact.Priceless? And that's why you had him k*ll Annie Littleton.No.Never mind that she had two kids.Oh, they can get along fine without their mother.Why not? You did.After your parents were k*lled.After the Japanese bombed Shanghai.There you are.Little Lucy and her loving parents.Living an enchanted life.And there's your handsome father, who, every day, brought you a new treasure."Here, Lucy."Here's a beautiful terracotta doll for my most special girl." Those were the happiest days of your life.Then they were finished by a b*mb burst.But this toy, it takes you back.And that's what makes it priceless.'Cause you would do anything to get back to that magical time.And, well, Annie Littleton just got in your way? She She was going to ruin everything.I just had to have it! Chinese should be happy to get that back.It's the only one of its kind.Annie Ming Littleton was one of a kind.

The bicycle guy.He was covering the passenger, probably sh*t him first.Maybe the passenger was the bigger handful.Or a bigger question mark than the driver.Their last delivery was at Houston and Pitt.The next one was on the Bowery at Prince.He had no business being on this street.Unless the driver had his own delivery schedule.Maybe Joel was showing the new guy a shortcut.Joel couldn't sit still in traffic for more than 10 seconds.He was always looking for a shortcut.Did he know he was gonna have a passenger today? No.It was a last-minute thing.So what's the damage here? Well, all I can see that's missing are four boxes of somatropin.Somatropin.That's human growth hormone.Athletes use it to bulk up.That's not a legal use of the product.How much were the four boxes worth? A little over half a million dollars.Now, the boxes were ordered by four different pharmacies.It's interesting how they all turned up on the same day.That's because they were all ordered on the same day last week.By four different pharmacies? That's a little too interesting.Could Joel have faked these orders? No.The company has safeguards.The orders have to come directly from a licensed pharmacist.Maybe Joel had a helper in one of these pharmacies.Halliwell's Pharmacy Friday, June 14 Xavier's worked for me for three years.I know his wife, his children.He's a good person.You know anybody else who has access to your order forms? No.Could I see this phony order? I actually placed this order for somatropin.It's not a forgery.You just remembered you ordered it? Well, I had a flood back here last month.Defective fire sprinklers.Had to replace a lot of my stock.Now seeing the paperwork reminded me of the somatropin.I'm sorry for the confusion.Was there anything else? - No.Thanks for your help.- Sure.Well, Mr.Halliwell, I just wanna make sure that I'm reading this right.It says here somatropin is contraindicated for people with diabetes.What happens if they take somatropin? Well, without a doctor's supervision, you run the risk of diabetic coma.That's what I thought.Thank you.We need to call some hospitals.We've had four young males with severe diabetic episodes in the last 48 hours.We still don't know what triggered them.You might wanna try and look for somatropin.Are any of the kids still here? Only one, Ryan Hendrickson.His friends brought him in seven hours ago.He'd already slipped into a coma.We've stabilized him, but we haven't determined how much damage there's been.Are his friends still here? His parents are in the waiting area.And there's a young woman.She was with him when they brought him in.Dr.Johnson, please call extension 2198.Miss DeSantis? Can we speak to you over here? We need to find out what happened to Ryan.His diabetes messed him up.He took something just before, right? Something he wasn't supposed to? Melinda, we think Ryan took a growth hormone called somatropin to help him build up his muscles.That's why he's in a coma.We need to know where he got it, so other kids don't end up in the bed next to him.Ryan injected this stuff he got from this guy Lane.Lane Ruddock.Lane said Ryan needed to get bigger and stronger.Why? Was Ryan doing sports? He wrestles.On a team at school? It's not a school thing.Come on! Dude, if you gotta clothesline him, sell it.Don't just stand there, move into him! And, Jace, you have got to sell getting hit.Grab your throat like you got a badger stuck in there.Come on, give me the face of pain.Sell it.You Lane Ruddock? What, the neighbors again? Look, we got a right to wrestle, okay? It's safer than hockey.What do you mean, this? We don't have a problem with this.In fact, I've always wanted to try it.Come on.Come on.Climb in with me? It's okay.Look, what're you people doing here? You know what's that move You know, the one where you take the other guy, you spin him over the top of your head? - What, the flying helicopter? - Flying helicopter.And then you plant him head down on the mat, it's so extreme.You know, I'm surprised more guys don't end up like, well, your buddy Ryan, in a coma, on a respirator.What? Hey, look, I had nothing to do with it.Detectives.Who are they? Those are our buddies.They're searching your parents' house.We found one box.Two-third's full.The somatropin, where are the other three boxes? Hey, buddy, you better answer her question, or you're going smackdown for two murders all by yourself.I didn't k*ll nobody, okay? I swear.Those guys, they fronted me one box.That was it.It was just one box.Excuse me.Could you get that box for me, up on top? Thank you very much.Drop the box.What's going on? What're you doing to my son? Arresting him.Seems he went into the pharmacy business for himself.We have Lane Ruddock.We have the box of stolen somatropin you sold him.We have an eyewitness who puts your van at the crime scene.- Am I forgetting something? - The sneaker.We have a sneaker print in your van that matches a sneaker print in the cargo area of the truck.That's it for now.We'll have an update once we grab up your accomplices.You know, I don't wanna tell you anything you already know, Luke, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you have here to tell us your story.Now this opportunity has the shelf life of, like, one, maybe two hours.By then, we'll have all your buddies in custody.Oh, the tales they will tell.None of them with a happy ending.- An hour, Luke.- Two at the most.Hang on a second.Do I have your permission to talk to them about it? My client's ready to cooperate.He had no prior knowledge of any plan to k*ll the drivers.He wasn't even aware his accomplices were armed.He didn't come forward before because Because he was afraid for his life.We know all the disclaimers by heart.What does he have to say? Nothing, until the DA signs off on the agreement, which is as follows: Twenty years in a medium-security facility in return for his testimony and his plea to second-degree robbery and four counts of forgery.Four counts of forgery? Four boxes, four forged order forms, four counts.Do I need to repeat anything? No.We'll be right back.That's a deal I can live with.What? The kid's copping to forging four order forms.One of the pharmacists, Halliwell, he told us his order was legit, it wasn't forged.One of them's lying.My bet, it's not this kid.Just got the good word.His accomplices are in custody.Two weapons recovered.One's the same caliber as the slugs from the victims.The kid's stuck to his story.He dummied up four orders of growth hormone, including the order from Halliwell's Pharmacy.If Halliwell didn't order this stuff, why tell you he did? Because if he told us the truth that the order was faked, he knew we'd be back.He knew he'd have to testify, he knew he'd be under more scrutiny than he wanted.What do you think he's hiding? Halliwell's Pharmacy Monday, June 17 Mr.Cardenas, is Mr.Halliwell here? No.You just missed him.Oh, rats.So, maybe you can help us with some information about this flood, with the sprinkler system.You should wait for Mr.Halliwell.It's not that complicated.The flood was just back there where you keep all the prescriptions? Yes.Well, the sprinkler system runs through the whole store.Why wasn't the whole place flooded? Well, Mr.Halliwell said that the back sprinklers are on a different waterline than the front.Excuse me, but Don't worry, he does this all the time.Were you here when the sprinklers went off? No.It happened overnight.Mr.Halliwell was already mopping up when I got in on Saturday morning.Do you know why they went off? Well, he said it was 'cause they hadn't had the scheduled maintenance done on them.Something about, you know, insurance not paying.Was there a lot of damage? Well, yeah, the whole back was wet.We lost a lot of inventory.How much? Well, I don't know.Mr.Halliwell took care of that.He's the one who keeps track of the inventory? For the prescription medicines, yeah.Thank you.And who fills out the prescription mostly, you or Mr.Halliwell? I count out the pills.And I do the ointments.Mr.Halliwell does the fluids, IV drips, cancer meds.It's very toxic stuff.Hey, what are you doing.You're gonna set that off.It's not going off because there's no water.Your boss disconnected the front sprinklers from the water line so when he set off the sprinkler system, only the back of the store got wet.Mr.Halliwell did it on purpose? Why? Why don't you just tell us what you saw that Saturday morning? Just that everything back there was all wet, that's all.Where were the dr*gs? I don't know.He told me to take the rest of the day off.When I got back on Monday morning, everything was back on the shelves.I got my file on Halliwell over here.He put in a big order six weeks ago, I know that.You sure you don't want any cake? It's really good.No, thank you.Sorry to pull you away from your birthday party.Every year I tell my assistant, "Please, no parties." But, hey, what can you do? - Just smile and eat cake.- Yeah.So what did Halliwell order? Oh Doxorubicin, gemcitabine, dactinomycin, ifosfamide, BCNU.What kind of dr*gs are those? Chemotherapy dr*gs.Cancer.- Did he order any other dr*gs? - No.Oh, he said a fire sprinkler went off, and his supply of chemo dr*gs got contaminated.Just the chemo? That's what he said.Well, our records show he bought almost $180,000 worth of dr*gs from you.Mmm-hmm.Is that considered a large purchase? Well, it's triple the amount he bought from us in the previous quarter.- $60,000.- Mmm-hmm.Why such a big jump? Well, I did my homework.I put together that he sold four times more chemo dr*gs than he was buying from me.I was losing business to a competitor.A competitor? Do you know who? Well, he wouldn't tell me.When did you have this conversation with him? About two months ago.You know, on second thought, I think I'll have a piece of cake.Be right back.This competitor he's worried about? There isn't any.He's Halliwell's only supplier.So Halliwell's doing a neat trick, turning 60 grand worth of cancer dr*gs into over $200,000 in sales.His customers might not think it's so neat.Jim, I'm sure you realize that commitments were made based on the one you made to us.And I intend to live up to it.I'm glad to hear that.I never expected any less from you.I just need to renegotiate the terms.The amount of the gift every month, it's just too much.How much would you be comfortable with? I need to cut it by half.I really need some relief here.I'll see what I can do.People consider you someone they can count on, Jim.You don't wanna risk disappointing them.How did you people get my name? From the state Medicaid.You and your wife have your prescriptions filled at Halliwell's Pharmacy? It's just me now.My wife passed away two months ago.We're very sorry.Mr.Lowell, if you don't mind our asking, what did she die of? Claudine d*ed of ovarian cancer.She was diagnosed two years ago last March.She had surgery and Then she went on chemo.Here.Smell this.It's a brandy wine.We planted them three months ago.That was the last day she was outside.What was your wife's prognosis when she was diagnosed? They said that she could b*at it, she was in the early stages.And there was no sign of improvement during the two years? No.The cancer just spread.It got worse.The suffering, the pain and the nausea.What did her doctor say? "Every cancer is different." That's what he said.Then he'd go and write another prescription.You didn't happen to keep any of them? No.What would I do with that stuff? I mean, it didn't do us any good when Claudine was alive.Two years from diagnosis to death, with a survivable cancer, a full course of chemotherapy.And her doctor's giving her good odds.Yeah, odds don't mean anything when the medication you're taking might as well be water.That's Halliwell's neat trick.He's diluting the dr*gs.We talked to the families of eight of Halliwell's customers who d*ed of cancer.They all said the same thing.There was no improvement, the medications weren't helping, the cancers just got worse.How long has he been at it? We checked the drug company's records and Halliwell's sales records.He's been selling more cancer dr*gs than he's been buying for at least four years.We could be talking about thousands of diluted prescriptions.And hundreds of deaths that might've been prevented.What about the dr*gs Halliwell is dispensing now? They're at full potency.His conscience finally got to him.More likely the drug company salesman did, when he told Halliwell he noticed the discrepancy between his sales and his purchases.That's why he had the flood.Making a case against him solely on the basis of sales records will turn into the battle of the bean counters.We need physical, medical proof he diluted those prescriptions.None of Halliwell's customers thought of saving a sample of their old prescriptions.The dead ones might've.Since I needed soft tissue for the tests, I only looked at people who d*ed in the last six months.Of those, I identified 14 cancer patients who statistically should still be alive if they'd received the right dosage of chemotherapy.Nine families gave me permission to exhume the bodies.Only nine? Well, you must have some bedside manner.There's a reason I work with dead people.After putting their livers under the microscope, here's what I have.Five had very low concentrations of chemo dr*gs, had they been getting the dosage they were prescribed.And the four other victims? Well, the results on three were inconclusive for a variety of reasons.On the other hand, number nine showed an unusually high concentration of the dr*gs doxorubicin and ifosfamide.This number nine actually have a name? Apartment of Frank Lowell Wednesday, June 19 The medical examiner just told me they wanted to do some tests on Claudine, to see how the medicine she was taking affected her cancer.I said if it's gonna help somebody else, sure, go right ahead.You don't want anybody going through what she did.No, ma'am.You were frustrated and angry the dr*gs weren't working.Yeah.It must've been discouraging for the both of you.Anyone in your position You might, at some point, think that death was inevitable.Mr.Lowell, there's no easy way to say this.We think we know why the dr*gs weren't working.We believe Mr.Halliwell was diluting them for profit.Your wife never got the full dosage, Mr.Lowell, or the full benefit of the chemotherapy.You thought we were gonna say something else, didn't you? That we found out that your wife d*ed of a massive dose of cancer dr*gs.Doxorubicin and ifosfamide.Maybe that the pain was unbearable, the dr*gs weren't working.You had no way of knowing that Mr.Halliwell was diluting them.So, you thought that you would do the one thing that would stop Claudine's agony.So you and your wife, you made a decision.And you used the rest of the medicine that she had left and injected it in her IV.Oh, God.Oh, my God.I k*lled her I k*lled her for nothing.Oh, God.You know I hate hypotheticals.If there's a factual basis to your question, then let's deal with those facts.Like, hypothetically, if one of the nine exhumed bodies d*ed as a result of an assisted su1c1de, then, yes, that's m*rder.And, yes, I'd be duty-bound to prosecute it.Well, then, forget we brought it up at all.It's not that easy.If we use the other eight exhumations against Halliwell, there is no legal way to hide the results of the ninth, from me or anyone else.Like you, I'd hate to put some poor widower in jail, but once the cat's out of the bag, I have no choice.Well, then we don't use the exhumations at all.Those exhumations are good evidence against Mr.Halliwell and I will be using them.So we can't convict Halliwell without sending Lowell to jail.Apparently not.If it weren't for him, Lowell and his wife would never have even considered su1c1de in the first place.Carver says he has no choice.Let's give him one.Let's give him better evidence against Halliwell.Look, I was noticing here.Some of the pharmacy's customers have the same address.- The Brightest Star Home.- Sounds like a nursing home.It's up in Westchester.Halliwell's home turf.He's even ripping off his neighbors.That's what's interesting.According to the Medicaid records, Mr.Halliwell was practically giving the meds away to these people.Brightest Star Nursing Home Westchester, New York Wednesday, June 19 Mr.Halliwell has been filling our prescriptions for our residents for many years.At less than cost.That's our arrangement with him.An arrangement.Does he have a financial interest in the home? No.I see there's a Reverend Mills, heads the board of your trustees.Are you owned by a religious group? We are a nondenominational residence.But you're owned by a religious group.The Church of the Sacred Redeemer.Are you a member of the church? I'm an elder.And Mr.Halliwell? He's an elder also.So supplying dr*gs to the residents here, that's his gift to the church.And this arrangement, that's a pledge he made? A very generous pledge, yes.A couple thousand dollars prescriptions a month doesn't sound very generous, especially from a church elder.There's more to it than that, right? Jim Halliwell has pledged $1.5 million toward a recreation center.When did he make this pledge? Four years ago.His generosity to the church has set a terrific example.I see it's inspired your employees.These charities they're involved in, AIDS babies, the indigent sick.One of the employees collects clothing and other items from the residents.Yes, once they've passed away, whatever the family doesn't want.Whatever's in the room, whatever would normally get thrown away.Yes.Could we meet this employee, you know, to give him a, you know, "attaboy"? Kenny'll be home from school next week.He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with his degree.So, I would really appreciate if you'd talk to him, give him some career guidance.Well, that would be fine.Just have him give me a call.Good stuff.Thank you, Jim.- Penny.- See you on Sunday, Reverend.That's quite a compliment, sending you his son for advice.The Reverend told our committee he's diverting funds from the volunteers' bazaar to the planning group for the recreation center.Why is that? He said some people weren't living up to their pledges.He told me to talk to you about it.Oh, for heaven's sake.What's going on, Jim? Business has been off, and I told him I had to cut back on our monthly giving.We can't.We made a commitment.Well, it's not forever.We're not the only ones.Other people have had to cut back.Other people buy pews.We're building a recreation center.What kind of example are we setting? Well, we can make it up to them in other ways.We can volunteer more time at the church.We don't just go to church with these people, Jim.We're on the PTA with them, the chamber of commerce.You want everyone to know we're pleading poverty? We're not poor.Jim, people respect us.They look up to us.They like us, our kids.We can't back out.I only take what the families let me and I give it to homeless groups, shelters for runaways, battered women.What else besides clothes? Old purses, unopened toiletries.- Clock radios.- Sure, yeah.Small appliances, kitchenware, everything gets used.What about over-the-counter medications, like aspirin? Sure, vitamins, cold medicines.Prescriptions? No.No, we have to throw those away.That's expensive stuff.I mean, all this is nice, but those medications can save people's lives.You see first hand how people suffer just because they can't afford the right medications.Like doxorubicin, and interferon, and aldesleukin.- I know what you mean.- You do? When someone dies at the home, of cancer, the dr*gs that they have left, they just get tossed away, doing no one any good? I mean, aren't you a little tempted to slip them in your pocket, and make sure they get to the people who really need them? That's against regulations.But it crosses your mind.How about Mrs.Barlowe who passed away three days ago? They told us she was taking aldesleukin, for renal cancer.That's a treatment for AIDS, isn't it? And you just threw it in the trash? Yes.Then it would've been in the dumpster when we checked.You see, we did a little dumpster diving.It's pretty nasty.But we didn't find any of Mrs.Barlowe's medications.Well, look, maybe society thinks what I'm doing is illegal But it's not immoral.How old are these prescriptions? Some of them might've been filled a couple of months ago.I thought these dr*gs could help people.Not these dr*gs.We were able to recover eight more chemo prescriptions that came from the rest home.Of the 23 we had tested, half were diluted.The labels are partially scraped off, but they're still identifiable as coming from Halliwell's Pharmacy.It's a fine piece of detective work, but I can't use it.The medications have been through too many hands.I couldn't prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Halliwell's the one who diluted them.I'm sorry.The exhumations are still our best evidence.Good news, Charlie.Well, these might not convince a jury but they might convince someone else.This is an incredible story.Well, you have the lab report right in front of you.And as you can see, the vials still have Mr.Halliwell's label.But there's nothing wrong with the medication Mr.Halliwell is dispensing now? Apparently not.Then I don't understand how I can help you.We believe Mr.Halliwell diluted the dr*gs to pay off the $1.5 million pledge he made to your church.You know, you two make a very good team.Look, if Jim had given me any hint that this pledge was a hardship, I never would've accepted it.But so far, he's kept up his end of the bargain.How's he been doing the last six weeks? Well, he's been wanting to cut back.He told me business hasn't been good.I bet.I'm sure you're both terrific detectives, but I can't reconcile the Jim Halliwell you describe with the one that I know.Jim and his wife Penny are both pillars of the community.How long have they been pillars of the community? I really couldn't say.It's something you grow into.Can you say when he became a church elder? When was that, about four years ago? That sounds about right.I can't help noticing, Detective, the way you pull together all these different elements.Good stuff.It's good stuff.Reverend, what I can't help noticing, is that's about the third time you've complimented us.Is that how you got Jim Halliwell to pony up a 1.5 million bucks? Ultimately, the gift has to come from the heart, but a little encouragement goes a long way.And making him a church elder went all the way to the bank.Those kinds of things are important to Jim.Jim and Penny are very involved in the community.They're well-regarded, and they take justifiable pride in that.They wouldn't wanna disappoint their neighbors.They'd be ashamed.Well, you know, Detective, shame is a very underrated emotion.In the big city, it's very easy to go unnoticed by others.So your conscience becomes your only witness.And for most of us, that's not enough.And I'm sure every Sunday you play that card for all it's worth.Thank you very much for talking to us.One more thing.Assisted su1c1de.What's your church's position? It's contrary to God's Law.A sin.Thank you.I filled the syringe with the chemo medicine, all the way up to the top, and then I injected it into her IV, and then I filled the syringe again all the way up with the rest of the medicine.What happened after you injected the dr*gs? She was feeling worse, her breathing became hard, and she kind of, like, seized up.Yeah, she stayed like that, in a coma for two days.It took her two days to die.How did you get the idea to use the cancer dr*gs? Well, when Claudine first started using the chemo, the doctor told her to be careful, because the medicine is a poison.If you use too much, you could die.You never discussed what you were doing with anybody? No.Did you buy extra medicine from Mr.Halliwell to make sure you had enough? No.Claudine and I, we didn't want anyone knowing what we were doing.We just did what we had to do, you know, just Just the two of us.Mr.Lowell, it took Mrs.Lowell two days to die? Yeah.Two days.I can't imagine what he went through, waiting for her to die.That must've been the worst hour of his life.Hour? He said two days.Well, I'm pretty sure I heard him say an hour.Maybe I need a prescription for my hearing.Reverend.Jim, I'm really glad you're back onboard.It'll make all the difference.Thank you, Reverend.Hey, Jim? Can we have a word? Hello.Aren't you gonna introduce us? Penny, this is Detective I forgot your name.I'm Robert Goren, and this is Detective Alex Eames.- My wife Penny.- Nice to meet you.What it's about is one of your customers, Frank Lowell.Maybe you don't remember him.No, I know who he is.Then you know his wife Claudine d*ed.Of ovarian cancer, yes.Actually, that's not what k*lled her.Mr.Lowell admitted to us it was an assisted su1c1de.He pumped her full of doxorubicin and ifosfamide.I'm sorry to hear that.But it's really none of my business.Well, no, apparently, it is your business.Mr.Lowell made a statement.He said he came to you.He told you his wife was getting worse, she was in constant pain, and he asked you to give him something to take her out of her misery.You told him to give her all the cancer medication that she had left, in one big sh*t.That's not true.It's right here in the statement.You told him how to k*ll his wife.That's assisting a su1c1de.Well, that's ridiculous.I didn't do anything wrong.Nothing wrong? Excuse me, Reverend, didn't you tell us assisting a su1c1de is a sin? Well, yes, but Well, there you go.It's a sin.But it's all lies.I never talked to this man about su1c1de.Come on, Penny.Oh, that's it, run away.You better get yourself a lawyer 'cause the next time you see us, we'll be arresting you for m*rder.This is crazy.I never m*rder*d anyone.Jim wouldn't help anybody commit su1c1de."He told me to give Claudine all the dr*gs at once."That's what I did."An hour later, Claudine was dead." That's what Frank Lowell told us.He's lying.You keep saying that.No, he is lying, and I can prove it.How? There's a fact in here you can prove isn't true? Show me this untrue fact.Is it on this page or She didn't die in an hour.She couldn't have.Why is that? The dr*gs wouldn't have worked that fast.We know how much doxorubicin and ifosfamide she had left.Our experts said it was enough to k*ll her in an hour.It's impossible.Listen, I've been a pharmacist for over 20 years.I know what I'm talking about.Well, how long? Two hours? Twelve? One day? I don't know.But there's no way she d*ed in an hour.Well, I'm sure we'd all like to know why that is.I'd just be speculating.There's no way that she would die in one hour.I mean, that's not speculating, that's certainty.There was something wrong with her dr*gs, wasn't there? No.You diluted her dr*gs, didn't you? No.That's why you knew she wouldn't die in one hour.You wanna know how long it took her? You know how long it took for the poisons to eat away at her heart, and her lungs? Two days.Two days.It was a mistake.It was an honest mistake.An honest mistake he made for four years.You even diluted the dr*gs that you sent to the old age home.- No.- Jim, They found the vials.They showed them to me.Tell them why you did it, Jim.Go ahead.Tell them you did it to pay off the $1.5 million pledge.Go ahead.Who knows, they might forgive you.I'm sorry.I just didn't wanna let you down.Please forgive me.- You're under arrest, Mr.Halliwell.- Please forgive me! Penny! The final tally was He pleaded to one count of fraud and tampering for every patient affected.We agreed to a sentence of 15 years to life.His chance to be the pillar of a whole new community.

Rick's not here.Law & Order CI Missing kid's Rick Davenport.That's his sister Amanda.She showed up Sunday.That's his roommate, Josh Phillips.He came up with Davenport late Saturday.We figure there was something going on between these two here, brother didn't much like it.I saw cameras on the way up.In the elevator.None in the stairs.We bagged everything in the trashcans here.Wasn't much in the dumpster downstairs.Check when they were last emptied.Yeah.I was told that there's a nanny.Sarah Eldon.She spent the weekend across the hall working her neighbor's slumber party.Watch out.You're gonna step on something.Peas.He had peas for dinner.Rick and Amanda were very close.Especially after the divorce.If your son were in trouble, where would he go? Well, he'd come to me, of course, or his mother.What are you suggesting? Bill, she's trying to help.Mommy.She just woke up and wanted a hug.- You're Sarah, right? - Yes.Did you see Rick and his friend this weekend? Just Saturday night for a little bit.They were drinking.They made you uncomfortable? Is that why you spent the weekend with the neighbors? Their nanny's a friend of mine.It was just easier for me.Amanda, did you see her? Sarah, Lucy wants a juice.I did not see Amanda.I was hoping Rick would leave early so I could go back upstairs, but the music was on all weekend.Sarah, she's thirsty.And all Rick said was they were going to watch the Knicks and play some computer games.You have to understand Rick wouldn't do a thing like this.- Not to his sister.- Of course not.Was Rick ever institutionalized? And what is that supposed to mean? Bill.He had, uh, been in rehab for drinking.For how long? Once for six weeks, and then eight weeks.Okay.Thank you.Don't tell me you found his diploma from Betty Ford.These peas, they came out of the roommate's gut.The way that they're lined up, that's something that an institutionalized personality does.It's an attempt to exert control in a regimented environment.All that from a few months in rehab? No.That's the point.The person who did this spent several years confined in a prison or a clinic.And this.The bloodstain across the front of the blouse.Looks like two separate stains, one on either side.Her blouse was closed when she bled on it.It was unbuttoned after she was k*lled.But there's no sign of sexual contact.Some clever person's trying to gaslight us.Into believing that Rick Davenport k*lled his sister and his friend in a - A jealous rage.- This was all staged.Everything except this.That was a reflex.Peas? You got to be kidding.You have to admit, it's spooky.What's spooky is the Davenport kid disappearing into thin air.Or down the garbage chute into the dumpster which was emptied Monday morning.Whoa, whoa.Well, if he's alive, he's been on the run for over 48 hours.Hasn't used his credit cards, bank account, hasn't contacted anyone.All right.If he's dead, if he was dropped down the chute, the k*ller would have to know the dumpster would be emptied before the bodies upstairs were discovered.An inside job.Bill Davenport made a k*lling with discount airlines back in the '80s.Now that his two kids from his first marriage are dead Wife number two's kid becomes the sole heir.The evil stepmother had the kids whacked.By who? The big bad wolf? Well, do priors for as*ault qualify? Tina Davenport had charges filed against her nine months ago by somebody named Jinny Canto.Central Park Tuesday, October 9 No, no, Ma'am.Tina never hit me.I work for a nice family now.I don't want any trouble.She didn't slap you? That's what it said in your complaint, before you dropped it.It was all a confusion, Ma'am.Just Well, okay.You're working for a nice family now, right? It takes a special person to raise somebody else's children.Do you have your own children back in the Philippines? Yes.A boy and a girl.They live with my sister.You send them money every month? So when the Davenports offered you extra money to forget about the complaint, you took it.Hmm? For your kids, right? How did Mrs.Davenport get along with Rick and Amanda? She pretends she likes them, and then she screams when Mr.William gives them money.Especially Mr.Rick.She didn't let him come home anymore.How do you know this? All the nannies here, they talk.Ma'am Tina says Rick tried to k*ll little Lucy.I'd never hit a servant.Jinny filed that ridiculous complaint because we fired her.She was stealing.My husband's diamond cufflinks, his gold watch.Sounds like you could've filed a complaint against her.Yes, well, we never actually caught her red-handed.What? You just fired her without any proof? Was there something else? Something that she knew? Something that she saw? Don't be sordid.She tried to hold us up for a raise.And if we didn't pay, she threatened to have us arrested, because she was made to sleep in Lucy's room.Which could be construed as forcing her to work around the clock.A violation of labor laws.Which is pretty smart for a country girl from the Philippines.I don't understand where you're going with this.There's a rumor going around about your stepson.You banned him from your home? There was a good reason for that.Rick tried to k*ll your daughter Lucy? I never said he tried to k*ll her.What exactly did he do? I was away for the weekend.Rick was staying with his father.He'd left his anxiety pills all over the guestroom and Lucy got hold of them.If Bill hadn't found Of course Rick denied he even took medication.Maybe you were afraid that next time it wouldn't be an accident.What are you talking about? We don't think Rick committed these murders.In fact, he may be a victim.Now that he and Amanda are gone, you don't have to be afraid for Lucy.You can devote all your husband's considerable resources into safeguarding her future.They found the Davenport kid at a garbage transfer station in New Jersey.Office of Medical Examiner Thursday, October 11 Cause of death was asphyxiation.This mark, it's a belt buckle.Yeah.I was getting to that.It's consistent with a belt buckle.The bruises overlap.The belt was tightened more than once.- Erotic asphyxiation.- He was k*lled during sex.Which is why there was lip balm on his genitals.Lip balm that neither of the other victims was wearing.Did you do a tox scan? Yeah.Anything in particular? Anti-anxiety medication.Alprazolam.Negative.If he'd taken it in the last month? No, there'd be trace amounts in his liver.Which there wasn't.And there's no record it was ever prescribed to him.So who left the pills the little girl found? Well, we're not the only ones being gaslighted.I never steal anything from Ma'am Tina.Never.She just makes me so mad.She made you sleep in Lucy's room on top of taking care of Lucy all day.Did you know that was a violation of labor laws? Yes.And how did you know that? One of the nannies at the park told you? No.Mrs.Whilden's nanny.The neighbor across the hall? Her name is Hannah Price.She's very nice to me.She helped me learn about American things.Like standing up for your rights.Yes.Was it her idea to tell the Davenports they couldn't make you sleep in Lucy's room? She told me it was not legal.She didn't tell you that you might get fired if you made trouble, did she? No, she said Ma'am Tina would just give me more money, no problem.One more thing.Did Hannah ever talk to you about Rick Davenport? She said he was handsome.Of course Tina got rid of Jinny.She was a thief and a troublemaker.How did your nanny react? Hannah? I'm sure she didn't care one way or the other.Did she mention working for the Davenports? What Hannah said was, since my daughters were getting older, she was feeling a little overwhelmed.In any event, the co-op has an understanding, we can't have nannies pitting one family against another.I told Hannah.That was the end of it.I bet she was disappointed after all the trouble she went to.All what trouble? Getting Jinny Canto fired so she could be closer to Rick Davenport.Oh, come off it.No, Hannah's just not that kind of girl.She knows her place.Especially when there was an opening across the hall.She was just, you know That was Hannah's way of telling me she wanted a raise.And once we settled that, she even helped Tina find a new nanny.Sarah Eldon.Hannah knows her from the park.- Hi, Mommy.- Hey, sweetie.Go get changed.Here, let me help you.Oh, she can manage.- Can't you, Hannah? - Yes, ma'am.You see? She knows her place.You know, I meant to ask, do you or your husband take anti-anxiety pills? In the first place, I am divorced.And in the second, that is none of your business.Sounds like a yes on the pills.She treats him so bad.She's such a meanie.She doesn't deserve him.None of them do.- Did he ask about me? - I don't think so.Lucy, don't go down there, okay? Never mind Lucy.Did he ask about me? Ouch.Every day, Hannah.You can see how much he cares.And what else? Tell me.And he's going to Paris next month.I think he might ask us to go.I knew it! Oh, God! Sarah, let's go.Lucy! Daddy's here.Hey, kiddo.How you doing? Mr.Davenport, I'm really sorry about Rick and Amanda.Hi.Mrs.Whilden isn't in.Right.We've been ringing the bell.The doorman thought that she was home.Hey, is it okay if we, you know, wait inside? She said she was having lunch with some of her lady friends.Lunch.I almost forgot about lunch.Is that your tummy I hear growling? Mmm-hmm.I'll get you lunch in a minute, sweetie.Are we keeping you from something? Mrs.Whilden asked me to tape a show for her on TV.Oh, hey, go ahead.We'll get lunch started.There's some tofu bologna on the bottom shelf.How about veggies? Do you like veggies? All right.Let's see what we have.Corn nibblets.You want to nibble on some nibblets? Yes.All right.This is gonna be an excellent lunch.Mrs.Whilden told us that you helped your friend Sarah get a job with the Davenports.Just lucky I knew someone.And lucky there was a job opening.You met Sarah at the park? That's right.Isn't that a risk, recommending somebody you just met? Sometimes you just get a good feeling about people.Well, Sarah's a very sweet girl.The Davenports are very lucky to have her.Especially at a time like this, huh? I'm sorry, I made a mess.It's no bother.One thing about Sarah, she's very shy.Yeah, she's not very sophisticated.Did you notice that? Well, she's from a small town.Oh, that's what we thought.Where? Upstate? I don't know.She never talks about where she's from? Uh Well, I just don't remember the name of it.What else do you guys talk about? You tell stories about your bosses? No.Oh, come on, I bet you have some juicy ones.Especially about Rick Davenport.We have other things to talk about.I saw a picture of him.He was handsome.I'm sorry, I have work to get on with.I have to change Abby and redd up her room before Mrs.Whilden comes home.You're from Pennsylvania.No, because you just said you need to "redd up" her room.That's what people say in Western Pennsylvania.I don't know.I'm from somewhere else.I think I just heard the videotape go off.Well, I better check it.Our virtual tour of Western Pennsylvania turned up a five-year-old arrest for Hannah Price in Meadville.It's a juvenile record, it's sealed.Could be for shoplifting.It's meaningless.The meaning is, there's a residential treatment center for children in Meadville.Where she was institutionalized? Probably.Her records are sealed.I can't help you unseal them.All you have is peas and corn kernels.You're a few lima beans short of succotash, Detectives.Succotash? Your evidence is anecdotal.I line up my shoes at night.Why am I not surprised? Idiosyncrasies won't sway the Pennsylvania attorney general.I can't even explain to him why these girls committed these murders.The answers are in those records.You'll have to find another way.Juvenile Treatment Center Meadville, Pennsylvania Monday, October 15 The rules on privacy are pretty clear.We're kind of at a dead end.See, my kid brother got engaged to this girl Her brother isn't the best judge of character.This girl had been very sketchy about her past.You know for a fact she was a resident here? She had this box of letters and some of them were addressed to her here.We didn't read the letters, of course.Why don't you just ask her? No.Her brother wouldn't like that.We need to know why Hannah was living here.Hannah.Hannah Price.Hannah lost her mother when she was six.Her father was unable to care for her, so she lived here.- For how long? - Till she was 16.Don't kids go to foster homes, normally? Yes, normally Look, if something's wrong with her and somebody gets hurt All I can tell you is that I just remember Hannah as a bright little girl who loved having her ears tickled.Is that both ears together? Yeah.It was something her mother used to do.A family thing.Didn't your brother say that Hannah had a sister? Oh Sandra.Sarah.Sarah.She had a different last name.Eldon.Now, is that because she was adopted? Yes.By a family in the area? Sarah just loved it.And it always had to be both ears at the same time.Something her mother did when Sarah was little.What happened to the mother? Lori d*ed in prison of AIDS.And the father? He ran out on them after Sarah was born.You did say Sarah was okay.She's not in any trouble? She's fine.It's Hannah we're interested in.You're not surprised.She's had a difficult life growing up with no family.We're curious about that.Don't they try to have siblings adopted together? That was our idea at first.But Hannah was a handful.She was always breaking things.She'd lied about everything.She was distant? You'd try to give her affection and she'd pull back.We tried so hard.But they told us she was pretty much a done deal.She probably didn't want to be adopted.That's what she said.She had this notion that one day her father was gonna come back for her.She told the caseworkers she didn't care if they were split up.She wanted Sarah to have a family.- She cared about her little sister.- Yes.When Sarah told us that Hannah had found her a job in New York City, we weren't so worried.Have you talked to her since? Not for a while.But she did send George a card on his birthday.Could we see it? "Dear Daddy, happy birthday from the Big Apple." "I miss you both so much." "Oh, Mommy, can you believe Madelyn's baby is Lance's?" Who are Madelyn and Lance? That's just our soap opera.We used to watch it together."Daddy, I'm kind of on a tight budget, but I want you to have these." "They were my father's." "You were there when he wasn't and I want you to have them." What did she give you? Cufflinks.Diamond cufflinks.She won't ever go back to him, even if he gets his memory back.But when she thought he was dead, she said she'd always love him.You are so naive.Where's Lucy? Hannah told me she was with you.We already looked through Sarah's room.Well, I can assure you that I look through Hannah's room on a regular basis and I have never found anything wrong.Stupid us, going to the trouble to get search warrants.In the Shadow of Tomorrow.That's a soap opera that she tapes.It's a little low-brow, but hardly criminal.Guess you didn't look in here."W.S.D." "W.S.D." William Davenport.Every night I went to sleep dreaming of the day my real father would come for me.And the man I dreamed about looked exactly like you.What is this? In the Shadow of Tomorrow, airdate June 5, 1997.This lovely couple in bed over here.That's Lance and Keri.Keri was "Miss Shadow Valley 1996." And she's wearing a scarf around her neck because they're experimenting in erotic asphyxia.March 1998.Angela's two-year-old daughter went into a coma when she accidentally ate Angela's tranquilizers.And this one.November of last year.It's Eden Montgomery and her stepfather on the eve of her wedding.They belonged to my father.You were there for me when he wasn't, and I want you to have them, Daddy.Let me guess, cufflinks.This soap opera for these girls, this is their playbook.Their whole life is a play.This is real.I had no idea.I mean In hindsight it makes sense.Hannah always made a special effort to make me notice her.Rick or Amanda ever let on they knew about this fixation on you? No, of course they didn't know.They No hint your son was having sex with Hannah that night? No.I told you, he said they were going to watch basketball and play some computer games.What computer games? Do you remember? Because we didn't find any games.He called it Shadow something.Shadow Shadow Valley? Yes.Shadow Valley.What? Shadow Valley is the place where the soap opera was set.The fact that your son knew about the girls' fantasy might have triggered the murders.I can't believe we allowed these monsters into our home.What I'm interested in, is how these monsters interacted.It was clear who was the boss.Hannah.How could you tell? Bill and I gave Sarah a cashmere sweater for her birthday.She was practically in tears, she was so appreciative.She wore the sweater all weekend long, and then she never wore it again.Hannah took it.I saw her wearing it.We took Lucy to her grandmother's this morning, after you called us.We need to get back to her.Mr.Davenport, we may need your help later on today.Who's the worst pro bono lawyer you know? The worst? That's easy.Stan Shatenstein.You know, hypothetically, how would we get Stan Shatenstein assigned to two defendants? What would we do? What would you do, hypothetically? Since Mr.Shatenstein covers night court, you'd make sure your defendants were arrested after 7:00 p.m.Well, m*rder one.So the death penalty's on the table here? Yes, it is, Mr.Shatenstein.What's your thinking here? We're thinking this one was taking orders from her big sister.Oh, yeah? Sarah, we know you and Hannah k*lled those people.We know it for a fact.We're offering you the chance to save not only your own life, but your sister's as well.We didn't hurt anyone.We didn't.There's something else that we know.We know why you did it.That Rick found out something that he wasn't supposed to.Something about Hannah.And then he used that knowledge to force Hannah to have sex with him and to have sex with his buddy Josh.Don't bother denying it.Here's another thing we know for a fact.Hannah stole these things from the Davenports.That's what Rick found out.That Hannah was a thief.That's what he had on her and he threatened to call the police, right? Sarah, we talked to the Eldon's in Pennsylvania.We know you're a good person.And the Davenports, they think the world of you.They want to help you.We told them whatever you did that night, it was because Hannah made you do it.You're nothing like her at all.You have people who raised you.Who love you.But Hannah I mean, she's She's like a paper cup in the breeze.She's not like that.You don't even know her.It's okay if you feel sorry for her.It's okay.But right now you have to think of yourself.You have to think of yourself.I don't know anything.I don't know anything.Well, when you're ready to talk to us, give Mr.Shatenstein a call.The DA said he'd be sending you the SVDF by tomorrow morning.Okay.Uh, what's that? It's a special form for capital cases.You haven't done a lot of capital cases, have you? I don't think he knows what he's doing.What did you say to those cops? Nothing, Hannah.I would never.Do they know? About that? No, they don't know about that.I thought they did, but they don't.They wanted me to say that you were the bad one.Because I got adopted and you didn't.But I didn't say that, Hannah.I swear.What's gonna happen to us? What's gonna happen to us, Hannah? Remember when Eden was in that prison in South America? How she was saved in the nick of time? We don't have anything to worry about.We just stick together, like always.Supreme Court Arraignment Tuesday, October 23 "Case number 163-3202."People v.Hannah Price and Sarah Eldon, "m*rder in the first degree, three counts." Your honor, if I may.I'm Elizabeth Carr from Eddington and Taft.I've been retained on behalf of the defendant.Are you here for both? No, just Sarah Eldon.Fine.Mr.Shatenstein, you're relieved from representing Miss Eldon.You'll be Miss Price's attorney.How does your client plead, Ms.Carr? Not guilty.Not guilty.And your client, Mr.Shatenstein? Not guilty.Your honor, at this time, I'm serving the people with a motion to sever.Have you anything to say about this here, Mr.Shatenstein? Uh, nothing right now, Judge.All right.People avail? No bail, Your Honor.The defendants have no jobs, no home, no ties to the community.Your honor, Miss Eldon is employed by Mr.William Davenport, the father of two of the victims.It's Mr.Davenport who retained me to represent her because he believes in her innocence.He's prepared to post any amount of bail to ensure her appearance.I hope be brought his checkbook.Bail is set at $2 million.My client also has significant ties to the community.She has no reason to flee.No reason to flee? She's facing the death penalty.With all due respect to Mr.Shatenstein, bail as to defendant Price is denied.Wait! Wait! - Where are you taking me? - Come on! I have to stay with my sister! - Come on, now.- Wait! What are you doing? Get off of me! Don't worry about Sarah.She's in good hands.That lawyer she's got there is pretty sharp.Hey, Mr.Shatenstein explain to you what happened back there in the courtroom? The motion to sever? No.What does that mean? It means that you and Sarah are gonna be tried separately.That'll be easier for Sarah's lawyer to, you know, blame you for the murders.Sarah would never do that to me.Maybe not.What I'm trying to say is, that at some point, Sarah is just gonna have to do what her lawyer tells her to do.Is that what happened with the adoptions? Because it never really made sense to us.Adoption agencies, they keep siblings together.I didn't want to be adopted.You stayed behind in that warehouse for kids because you wanted your little sister to have a better life.Does she know what you did for her? Does she know how lucky she is to have you watching out for her? We're lucky to have each other.Well, right now she's the lucky one.With Bill Davenport.Here.Well, look at the way he behaves towards her.You know, the way he tells her things.He's very He's very fatherly.Well, it must be fate how their paths crossed.- I got her that job.- I know.You know, it's really unfair.Considering that you're the one that did all the work to get close to him.When you first saw him, Hannah,did he look like the man that you dreamed about when you dreamed about your real father coming for you? - What did you say to me? - That's what Sarah told us.No, she didn't! Yes.She told us all about you You are lying! There they go.She's going home.Next time you see her it'll be in the courtroom when she testifies against you.No! That'll be the last time, because Bill Davenport won't allow her to see you in jail.Sarah will take the place of his dead daughter.She's gonna become Lucy's big sister.It'll be like you never existed.No! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! They were pigs! They laughed at us! I'll tell you everything! She helped me k*ll Rick in the bed.She helped me.And Amanda, it was her idea to call Amanda.She knew her number.I didn't! She k*lled Amanda! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! I want my sister! I want Sarah! Well, our little ploy worked.She gave up her sister.Gave up.Yes, and no.
02x08 - The PilgrimQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:19In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.Sorry I'm late.I wanted to find that wine you like, and I had to go all the way to the Bowery.Al, honey? What? No way.No way.Pick up.Pick up.It's me.I thought things were really great, and now I find this typed letter not even signed? You have to talk to me, Al.If this has anything to do with my parents coming, it's really not okay.I'm not mad, I just wanna talk.Maybe he's just scared of committing.The way you talk about your dad.It's not my dad.It's him.He's got somebody else.- I could just k*ll him.- If you could find him.Oh, I'll find him.Watch this.Al, this is Leslie again.You don't call me in the next 12 hours, you're in big trouble.I know what's been going on at school.Like that ever works.I gotta go to the gym, see you.Please, honey, just call me.Please.If you don't have enough money why don't you put back the vermouth? You can't make a martini without vermouth, okay? How much you need? Oh, no, that's okay.She needs 80 cents.Here.If you give me your address, I'll send you the money.Forget it.Thanks for letting us in.I don't know why she didn't meet us at the airport.Leslie? Yoo hoo? It's Mom, we're here.What's this? Leslie? Her purse and her wallet and her keys are here.Please call the police.Maybe she's visiting somebody in the / Just call them now.And use your cell.And don't touch anything.Law & Order CI Missing woman is Leslie Dornan.Neighbors haven't seen her since yesterday.She have a boyfriend, girlfriend? Not according to her folks.- Her father's a cop? - Pittsburgh PD, retired.Guess he knew which strings to pull to get Major Case here.This turns into anything, we'll put you in on the collar.Go ahead, impress me.It's Aramaic.It's the language that Christ spoke in.Parts of the Old Testament were written in it.But don't ask me what it means.This is Aramaic too.Mr.And Mrs.Dornan? Is that your daughter's handwriting? I don't know.I can't tell.This wall-hanging here? My mother brought that back from Turkey.It's the Lord's Prayer.But I don't think that Leslie knew that language.The last time you talked to her, how did she sound? She sounded fine.Leslie wouldn't hurt herself.She loves life, she's a fighter.The detective said you didn't think Leslie was involved with anybody.No, she wasn't.Well, she definitely had a regular visitor.This is hair gel.He liked to sit here and watch TV.He'd rest his head against the wall.Those are scuff marks.He liked to put his feet on the table.Well, he's tall.Six, 6'4".If she had a boyfriend Why didn't she tell you? How about you tell us about her boyfriend? Al? They broke up last Tuesday.Leslie came home, his stuff was gone.She was furious.She kept leaving messages on his phone, how she was gonna make trouble for him.Let's start with Al's full name.Alan what? It's not Alan.It's Ali Al-Javad.He's Moroccan.He's a grad student at Hunter.Is that why she didn't tell her parents about him? Because he's Moroccan? Her dad could be pretty intense.She must have really liked him.He made her feel so special.He bought her expensive gifts, antiques.I noticed the coffee table.That was a gift? Yes.He had me buy that for her in Amsterdam last summer.He just gave you a bunch of money and told you to buy what you want? No.He gave me the name of the antique store.They took care of the shipping.Who picked up the coffee table on this end? We all did.We took my brother's van to the customs broker in Jersey.Just the table.Nothing else? Yes.If you're trying to freak me out, it's working.How did Al and Leslie meet? You're embarrassed.Did he pick her up in a bar or maybe a chat room? It's not sleazy.It's the Singular Singles website.You can see their video, hear what they have to say.It's not like a total pick-up.I love dancing salsa and singing karaoke.This is the boyfriend, Ali Al-Javad.My dream girl is a full-figured American lady who loves to laugh.Give me some mail.No, he's not Moroccan.When Moroccans speak English, they sound French.I'd put this guy further east.How about we put him in this seat? You talk to his college? Well, he registered two years ago.Took a full load the first semester and then one class each semester after that.Just enough to satisfy the requirements of his student visa.And then he found a girlfriend.Someone vulnerable, grateful for the attention.Somebody who'd be afraid to ask too many questions.He moved in with her, everything's in her name.He stays off the radar.He's a sleeper.Maybe, just maybe, this guy doesn't like school.Maybe he's just here for a good time.We still have a missing woman.A 33-year-old single woman who'd been drinking, who'd been dumped.I mean Someone is trying very hard to convince us she committed su1c1de.This is the translation off the wall writing.It's from the Old Testament.The Song of Songs."Night after night on my bed, I have sought my true love." "I have sought him but not found him." "I have called him but he has not answered." They wanted to write a su1c1de note, but they couldn't fake her handwriting, so they wrote it in Aramaic.Ali took a flight out of Newark to Germany Tuesday night.The day before Leslie disappeared.One of his buddies must have taken care of her.He left the country the same day he left her? Well, whatever job he had to do here, it was over.Look at this itinerary.He had to connect through Atlanta and Paris.No.He could have flown direct from JFK for half the price.Maybe he was hooking up with somebody in those cities.Or maybe it was about leaving out of Newark.He had something to do in New Jersey before getting on that plane.The table.The table he had Leslie's friend buy in Amsterdam, it was shipped to a customs broker in Jersey.An antique that he could have bought in SoHo for less money.It was a dry run.He was testing the customs inspection.He brought something else in.He had to take delivery of it or maybe hand it off to somebody before leaving the country.All Ashore Customs Broker Weehawken, New Jersey Friday, November 1 Tuesday, yes, Mr.Al-Javad picked up a crate of household goods from the Netherlands.Did Customs inspect it? Inspect? Oh, the crate? You're kidding, right? I guess we are.How large a crate was it? Three foot by three foot.Weight, 80 pounds.The container the crate was shipped in, where would that be now? Ali's crate was loaded in first.That would put it somewhere in the back.You know, we get about six million containers a year coming in, and we only check about 2% of them.The more I know the less I sleep.This corner here is positive for expl*sives.Do you have any idea how much? Judging by the way Homer's bouncing around, I'd say a lot.So much for sleep.The lab tests from the container came back positive for Titadine.It's a high-yield, high-grade form of dynamite.Titadine.There was an advisory on that stuff last year.Eight tons of it were stolen from a factory in France.Most of it's unaccounted for.Until this morning.The Feds and the Joint Task Force are gonna be all over this.You're not suggesting we bow out.Hell, no.We've got a suspected homicide to clear.Where are we with Mr.Al-Javad's accomplices? We found a number of prints from the rental van.I like this guy.Jorge Galvez.His prints were on the inside of the cargo area of the van.He's got a juvenile record in Baltimore.It's g*ng related.Then he served three years here for assaulting a motorist over a fender bender.A rageholic.Since he was paroled two years ago, he's been clean.Not even a parking ticket.His last year in prison he worked in the library, he got his GED.Something put him back on the straight and narrow.A religious conversion? He wouldn't be the first person to find God behind bars.Some people find Allah.Some people find Jesus.There are a lot of teams in the league.Galvez finished his parole, but maybe his PO is still in touch with him.Smokin' Chicken Brooklyn, New York Monday, November 4 Jorge hasn't worked here since a year ago last spring.What happened to him? He went to the hospital.His appendix burst.After that he disappeared.His last paycheck I mailed to his apartment, it got returned.You meet any of his friends? Just the people from the prison outreach program.What about his religious friends? His parole officer told us that he converted to Islam when he was in prison.And I can see that you sell halal chicken, meaning it's slaughtered according to Muslim tradition.I know that your community has had a rough year and we are not looking to make things any worse.There's a missing girl.Jorge might be involved.We need to find him.I took him to our mosque, helped him with his Arabic so he could read the Koran.Jorge had this big chip on his shoulder.He'd talk a lot of trash about America, how oppressed he was.I told him, you stop breaking the law, you won't feel so oppressed.When Jorge went to the emergency for his appendix, who took care of him? A girlfriend? A nurse.He was at Mount Sinai for over a week.A week? I like your health coverage.Our health coverage is my wife's chicken soup.We don't cover hospitals.Somebody had to guarantee that hospital bill.I just signed the hospital papers.The prison outreach program that I was working with at the time, they had a fund for that sort of thing.Have you seen Jorge since? No.Once his parole was up, we didn't keep in touch.Excuse me.That's a smart question, Randy.That's your name, right? Randy asked why the Greek Bible is called the Septuagint.Septua means 70 and the story is that it took 70 scholars to translate the Hebrew Bible into Greek.At the great library at Alexandria in Egypt, right, Mr.Edwards? Right.The library and its 700,000 books were destroyed by fire over 1,300 years ago.My mother was a librarian.They just built a new library on the site of the original.This time with state of the art smoke detectors.You've been? I've read about it.I'm one of five people who actually reads the Smithsonian magazine.Six.Yeah, one of six.I should get back to class.Substitute teacher.You must like punishment.I like making a contribution.I wish you could make one to our case.He had an uncle in Baltimore.A dry cleaner.He was talking about hitting him up for work.I hope that helps.Jorge's uncle, the dry cleaner, d*ed three years ago.So either Jorge lied to Edwards or Edwards lied to us.What's this? It's the Smithsonian article on the new library in Alexandria.When Edwards mentioned smoke detectors, it didn't ring a bell.You actually read this when it came out? The magazine's the perfect size for my treadmill.There's nothing in here about smoke detectors.And since there's no reason Edwards would mention a detail like that He's been to Egypt in the last year.The State Department would know.The Egyptian consulate in Munich issued a tourist visa to Ethan Edwards a year ago last June.A week later, they issued another one to Jorge Galvez.They both got passports in April last year.They both left the country in the same week, and they both got back two months ago.Sounds like they had a meeting of the minds.Edwards' co-workers, at the outreach program, they knew he was a Muslim, but he didn't become political until he met Jorge Galvez.The school board have an address on Edwards? Just a PO box.I'll get Carver working on a subpoena for the postal records.You two call the task force.- Bedroom clear! - Bathroom clear! Living room clear! This is not good.It's rat poison.Rat poison's an anticoagulant.su1c1de bombers in Israel, they use it to mix with the shrapnel when making bombs.The idea is when their victims are wounded, they bleed to death.A su1c1de bomber.When the hell did this kid decide that's what he wanted to be when he grows up? Doesn't look like he's planning to grow up.This is the crate they shipped from overseas.The K-9 unit came up positive for expl*sives.Once we get all this weighed, we'll know how much Titadine we have to worry about.Edwards lived here alone until a couple of weeks ago, another man described as male, Hispanic.- Galvez.- We couldn't get a positive ID.At this point, we're not sure which one's the actual su1c1de bomber.It could be a su1c1de bomber, or they might try and use a remote-controlled device.Well, I'm going with a su1c1de bomber.You see here, here and here.Something was taped to the wall.The paint was ripped off when it was taken down.And duct tape residue.The sheet was used as a backdrop.And These three marks.Probably a tripod.I think they made a video tape.A su1c1de note.The Bureau feels releasing any information to the public is counterproductive.It might even provoke these people to step up their operation.They already know we got their scent.We weighed that crate, they have 50 pounds of Titadine, they made a vest, they're good to go.Agent O'Dell, it's established practice to let the eyes and ears of the American public help us deal with t*rror1st threats.For once we have more to offer them than a color scheme.We have the actual photos of the t*rrorists which the District Attorney will recommend be released to the media.I'll let my people know that.We're still tracking down Galvez's associates and relatives here and in Baltimore.We got some background on Edwards, he might have family up in Westchester.Which one is the designated martyr? Galvez took electronics courses in prison.He probably assembled the b*mb.Which leaves Edwards the job of carrying it.What are his qualifications? Theology major at Manhattan University with a minor in languages.He speaks Spanish, Arabic, working knowledge of Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic.Everything you'd need to study the Bible in the original text.He volunteers in soup kitchens.He mentored kids in inner city schools.How can a man with that background m*rder innocent people? Well, that's probably why he made a tape.To explain himself.We can always ask his parents.Home of Joe & Vera Edwards Bronxville, New York Thursday, November 7 It's because of his religious beliefs, that's why you singled him out.Mr.Edwards, will you please just answer my question? He called last July.He was in Phoenix.He'd just gotten back from traveling around Europe.And Egypt.He got a visa for Egypt last year.Yes, he visited Egypt.Why aren't you telling us anything? Is Ethan hurt? We spoke to Ethan three days ago.He's working as a substitute teacher in Queens.Did you know that's what he was doing? No.If Ethan wanted us to know he was here, he would've told us.Mr.Edwards, I need you to unlock the door to the garage.This woman is missing.Leslie Dornan.Maybe Ethan knows what happened to her.- Is she his girlfriend? - No.It's complicated.Ethan would never hurt anyone.He's a very ethical person.Well, he's certainly familiar with the Ten Commandments.He's got the Torah, the Koran, the Bible with notes written in the margins.He followed a path of study.He probably would've been a minister if it weren't for his father.Your husband doesn't like religion? Joe's a chemist.He likes tangible things.And Ethan embraced the intangible.Have you ever talked to him about his conversion to Islam? He said it made him feel centered and connected to something bigger than him.When was this picture taken? That's the summer I took Ethan to do volunteer work in Appalachia.He was just ten.Did your husband take that picture? No.Joe didn't go with us.It wasn't a good time in your marriage? Maybe it brought you and Ethan closer.When Ethan was traveling, maybe he contacted you more than your husband.He sent me e-mails.He called me once, after the att*cks.I wasn't sure where he was.Did he talk about the att*cks? He wanted to know if anyone we knew had been hurt.He sounded very shaky.He wanted to come home, but he said he had things he had to do first.You're probably the one person that he's afraid to disappoint.Oh, he knows that couldn't happen.You said that Ethan was looking for a connection to something bigger than himself.Now, if he found people that offered that connection, he might be persuaded to do things that he found morally repugnant.What things? A su1c1de bombing.Oh, my God, no.Oh, Ethan.You can help us bring him in.As we reported earlier, Vera Edwards, the mother of fugitive t*rror1st suspect Ethan Edwards, suffered a massive heart att*ck after being informed that her son might be a member of a t*rror1st cell.A spokesperson for Saint Peters hospital says that Mrs.Edwards remains in very critical condition.In fact We're monitoring the hospital, the parents' house, phones, e-mails.In the hopes he'll reach out to his dying mother? Detective Goren feels that she's a role model for Edwards.They've got something.You raised me to believe you can't take without giving back.So really, this is a path I was always meant to walk.Tell everyone that there's a message coming, and America better read it carefully because it's being written in a language it understands.It was e-mailed to his parents.It's clean, nothing embedded, no way to trace where it came from.This is a streaming video, right? Like the videos on Singular Singles? The software to process and send a streaming video, are they all the same? No.There are different kinds.And each one would have a signature on the video? Sure.Why? Hello, I'm Khalid.I'm a stock analyst with an MBA from Wharton School of Business.I enjoy sports This is the only video I found on Singular Singles that uses the same software as the Edwards video.I like romantic dinners and long walks in the city at night.Let's give him his long walk.Get his phone number and address from the website.I got pizza.Police! Get him down, get him down! He was gonna k*ll Edwards.Keep Edwards from talking.Talk about what? We got the b*mb.One of the bombs.This vest weighs about 40 pounds and minus the shrapnel.We've only got about 20, There's another vest out there.Our search of Khalid's place didn't turn up any leads to Jorge or to what their target might be.These items were in Ethan's knapsack.We're not sure what this is."1/55 at 31." It doesn't correspond to any address.The Bureau is assuming Galvez and Edwards were planning a coordinated att*ck.The first man detonates in a crowd.The second man waits for rescue personnel to arrive or targets the crowd fleeing the first expl*si*n.All we need is when and where.Well, they'd pick a confined space to maximize the concussive power of the shock waves bouncing off the walls.If we assume Galvez sticks to the plan.Do we have a choice? The task force turned up an e-ticket in Khalid's name for a flight out of JFK to Madrid tomorrow night.If this follows the MO, it means his part of the job would be over by then.Which puts the target date for the operation within days from now.Step into him fast.You're an American citizen, Ethan.Born and raised.Free to worship in a religion of your choice.How can you sit there and let Jorge k*ll innocent Americans? Well, maybe what they say is true, you're a traitor.The worst kind of scum.No, I'm not a traitor.One nation under God.My allegiance is to God, to Allah.k*lling in the name of God is good? It's better to k*ll in the name of oil? I don't get it, Ethan.Your family told us you were upset by 9/11.It was a mistake.It was too much.But then America sent g*n ships and k*lled hundreds of innocent people, women, children.that no one learned.So we need what? A refresher course? Look, I'm sure that he has it all worked out.Anyway, this is all, you know, big-picture stuff.My partner and I, we're here for the little picture.For Leslie Dornan.Her parents just wanna bury her.You know, it just occurred to me that you haven't asked about your mom.You don't wanna know how she is? How is she? We're working on the barter system here, Ethan.You give us something, we give you something.You're afraid.No, you're afraid that you're gonna fail this test.That those other guys were right.Who? What are you talking about? Well, the reason why Khalid tried to k*ll you.To protect the operation.I accept that.He knew it.And the other guys at the training camp, they knew it, too.Ethan, when it comes right down to it, this is really not your fight.I mean, you don't have centuries of injustice and colonial oppression to harden your resolve.I'm a Muslim.It's my fight, too.You know, I read the Koran a long time ago.When I was in the army, I was stationed in Germany.And there was this girl who lived near the base, she was Turkish.She was Muslim.I wanted to impress her.And you know, it's really not what you'd expect.For example, they recognize the right for women to vote, to own and inherit property.To divorce their husbands.And this was written what? Like 1,300 years ago.It's the true word of God.Well, you would know.You've been looking for the true word.You've been searching for God.But there's one thing that I couldn't find in here.And that's the part where Allah, you know, tells everybody to just go ahead and indiscriminately k*ll innocent people.I mean, that part, that's not in here.I mean, where is that? Must be in some secret chapter.But it isn't because I didn't miss it, did I, Ethan? I mean, it's exactly what my Muslim friends told me is that it's not in the Koran.That there's no sanction for what you were planning to do and what Jorge still plans to do.No, we weren't You weren't what? Let me show you something.This x-ray is of a su1c1de b*mb victim in Israel.This victim has no external injuries, no shrapnel wounds.Just this white mass.Emergency room doctors call this the white butterfly.It's what the heart and lungs and other internal organs look like after they've been turned into soup by the concussion from the b*mb.Ethan, what I want to know is you went searching for God, how did you end up looking for targets? That's probably news about your mother.Oh, by the way, this x-ray is of a five-year-old girl.I was sent by God.So are we.We have to consider another option.Sodium Amytal.Truth serum? I've seen it used on Soviet defectors, and it didn't work.If we inject him, we'll lose his trust, and it'll waste time.Ethan is a difficult subject, and we have nothing to leverage him with.We have his sense of morality.His sense of morality is what got us here in the first place.The FBI has access to it, doesn't it? I'm not getting squat without authorization from Justice.The new FBI.Well, isn't that what the President said? You're either with us or against us? He sees the world in high contrast.It's black and white.Our way or the highway.He has no idea what we sound like to the rest of the world.Washington's still making up its mind.Progress? So, you gonna lead us out of our ignorance? I just want America and the West to stop trying to control the destiny of my Muslim brothers and sisters.Surgery? So, you think by blowing yourself up is a step in the right direction? Martyrdom has a lot of symbolic value.Buddhist monks set themselves on fire to protest their religious persecution.A man did it at the Pentagon in the '60s to protest the Vietnam w*r.And they were understood loud and clear because they didn't muddy it up by k*lling other people.You ever think about that instead of a su1c1de b*mb? Well, I'm sure things made a lot more sense six months ago.You know, they were much clearer I'm just tired.No, no, no, no, no.You had doubts long before you ran into us.About how all this k*lling squares up with the will of a merciful God.Of course I had doubts.I'm not a psychopath.Well, you had more than doubts.You knew you were lost."Night after night on my bed, I sought my true love." "I sought him but not found him." "I call him but he does not answer." In the trade we call this a tell, Ethan.You didn't write the verse on Leslie's wall by mistake.You wrote it 'cause you were calling out to God, and he's not answering.And you haven't felt this lost since that summer you went to Appalachia when your parents separated.And that is your personal struggle, your jihad, to find connection to something bigger than yourself.And nothing's bigger than God.And the moment you realized you lost connection with him was when you were watching Jorge k*ll Leslie.It wasn't supposed to happen.He was just gonna talk to her.So if Leslie had to die to protect your mission then maybe there was something wrong with your mission.Something unjust.And that's what was going through your head.I wouldn't k*ll innocent civilians.Well, Leslie's dead.And more innocent people will die if Jorge sets off his b*mb.There's only one way back to God.There's only one way to make your parents understand that you're not about this or this.If I tell you where she is, what do I get? We'll tell you how your mother's doing.I'll write down the address.If you tell us where Jorge is, how we can stop him, we might let you know where your mother is.Whatever happens is God's will.Boiler Room Webster Projects Bronx, New York Sunday, November 10 I hope this doesn't turn out to be the consolation prize.These hairs under Leslie's fingernails.Yeah.Blond hairs, short, razor cut, black roots.- Jorge's gone blond.- I have shoe prints here.Boots.Anyone do boots? What do you think, m*llitary issue? Regular army, mid '90s.Brand new.Probably came from a surplus store.He's got a crew cut.He may be wearing m*llitary Clothing.Ethan said they wouldn't k*ll civilians.Civilians.Tomorrow's Veteran's Day.The Veteran's Day parade down Fifth Avenue.That's a two mile long target.The note we found from Ethan's backpack, That's the mechanized infantry battalion.And 31 could be 31st street, their muster point for the parade.Why that battalion? First of the 55th were deployed to the Gulf.These are Desert Storm veterans.Authorities are still seeking information on the whereabouts of suspected t*rrorists Ethan Edwards and Jorge Galvez.Police are investigating reports that Galvez was spotted in his native Baltimore.Other sources tell us authorities now believe the suspects may have fled the country.In other news We have a possible ID.East of Madison, south side of the street.Hey.Desert Storm, right? I can tell by your uniform.I was 171st Armor.You were with the 55th mechanized division.You got your ID? You know, they're checking IDs.You wanna smoke? You know, I quit seven years ago, but being back in the uniform really plays a trip on my head.You got a light? Police! Clear! Out of the way! Get those people back.Mark the perimeter.God's will.Let's hope so.
02x09 - ShandehQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:19The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.What am I supposed to do with this? That's all I can spare right now.You want my kids living on Happy Meals? Sandi, I shouldn't even be here.Why are you being this way, Danny? You know where you wanna be.Sammy's raving about this smoked salmon he found in Nova Scotia.Lockport.Okay.You went there this morning.Mom, she has kids.They're not your kids.Kelly called.She needs to talk to you.Yeah, hi, honey.It's Daddy.Put Mommy on.It's Dad.You just got in? Yes.You know, the traffic.What's up? I won't be able to make it this afternoon.My sister's coming in for the day.Oh, no, that's not acceptable.You have to call them and tell them that we'll be there.We'll talk tonight.Don't start with me, Mom, okay? Mike's coming in from Binghamton.All the cousins can be together.What date is that? The fourth.I can't.It's the first day of Sukkoth.Sukkoth, the Festival of the Booths.And don't try to tell me that sounds any weirder than the Feast of the Transfiguration.Mom hasn't seen your kids since, what, just before Easter.I know.Maybe I'll just drive up one Sunday with Jordie and Sharon.Is everything okay with you and Danny? You keep asking that.Yes.The business just takes up a lot of his time.I have to run.Housekeeper leaves at 4:00, and I don't want the kids coming home to an empty house.Tell Mom I'll call her tonight.Kelly, we can still talk.Law & Order CI The lady who drove the kids home from school found her about 5:30.Where was Mr.Sussman? Oh, he got home from work at 6:15.We were already here.He looked pretty shook-up.We'll see.See the hand spread across her neck? It's almost a foot wide.And this bruise here.See? Knuckle marks.Smaller hand.Yeah.A second assailant.Came from that side.She didn't stand a chance.Oh, but she fought back.Her nails are torn.Threads from a gauze bandage? Now, that's antiseptic cream.One of them might have been wearing a bandage.She came over the top of the hood to get away from them.But why did she go back in the car? The way out.Instead of overwhelming her as soon as she got out of the car, they hesitated.They gave her an opening.And then when they regained control, they used excessive force to k*ll her.Amateurs.I thought that other detective I talked to, he was running things.Your borough president called the police commissioner.That's how the case came to us.Your family's prominent in the community.Well, my father was a very important man.He helped a lot of people.Children, come in the kitchen with Grandma.Yeah, go ahead.It's a terrible thing they had to find their mother that way.Sussman Kosher Foods.I see your trucks around all the time.Everything good between you and your employees? Yeah, we have no complaints.You and Mrs.Sussman? Anything we should know about? Everything was fine.The kids are doing well.We had our health.You have something in your eyes? No.Why? Blinking your eyes a lot, that usually means you have something in your eyes.Or that your stress level has gone up.It's called the blink rate.Well, of course, I'm under a lot of stress.Of course.Do you know where your wife was earlier this afternoon? Her sister Anna had come down from Albany for the day.Kelly was meeting her in the city.Would she have been wearing any jewelry? She always had her wedding ring and a necklace that I bought her for our 10th anniversary.It had three diamonds, for me and each of the kids.She always told me everything was fine.She was very private about her marriage.But something made you ask.Our mother had a stroke a few months ago.I was calling Kelly late at night with progress reports.A lot of times, Danny wasn't there.Where did she say he was? At some religious observance.You know, prayers.What religious observance takes place late at night outside the home? I wouldn't know.I'm not Jewish.- Oh, Kelly converted.- Yes.So her children could be raised in their father's faith.Kelly was familiar with the Jewish traditions? She had to be.The Sussmans are a very religious family.Could you write down the dates and the times that you called her at home? There are three daily prayers in the Jewish tradition and a man might leave the home to go pray with the minion, with nine other men.Sussman might have had a legitimate reason to be out.Except that the last prayer takes place in the early evening.Which Mrs.Sussman would have known, being familiar with the traditions.She was covering for her husband.Seems to be part of her M.O.She didn't let on that there were problems.She was better at it than he was.Two months ago, Tuesday night, 11:10 p.m., he made a withdrawal for a thousand bucks from an ATM on the 600 block of Cuthpert Boulevard.What's the date on that? There was a call to a business on Cuthpert.Here.Same day, from his cell phone, at 5:00 p.m.To Stan's Show Supplies.One block down from the ATM.Stan's Show Supplies Monday, June 24 Sussman, one of his checks bounced.We were holding his order until he came up with one grand cash.What was in his order? I don't remember.Show stuff.You mean, like in Stan's Show stuff? Maybe we should ask Stan.There is no Stan.There's Mr.Harland, and he's gonna be back here in an hour, and I gotta get these orders out.We'll write you a note, how you were helping with a m*rder investigation.Now, Sussman's in the food business.What does he need lighting equipment for? Sussman told me he did charity events.Rented to Firefly Enterprises for delivery on 10th Avenue in Manhattan.Spotlights, glitter ball, smoke machine.What's this abbreviation for? A bubble bath setup.It's a clear Lucite bathtub.Charity events.Charity must be the girl who takes the bubble baths.Hey, how long I gotta wait in the car? Huh? Don't we gotta do a thing tonight? Next time will be on the house, baby.It's gonna take at least an hour to get all the way up there.Since when did you grow a brain, huh? Come on.Pearl's Strip Club Monday, June 24 Sussman's got the lease till the end of the year.After that, it's available.Why'd he close up? I don't know.Business was good.Is there a problem with the lights? Fuse box blew three weeks ago.Just like that? Well, two days later I got a letter from Sussman's lawyer wanting to break the lease on account of the electrical problem.- Do you mind if we have a look? - No, go ahead.They poured acid behind the connector.That's blood.Well, he splashed acid on his arm.He would've had to reach in.He came over here to wash it off, and he used this to wipe his wound.Gauze fibers on Kelly Sussman.Yeah, from the bandages of the k*ller.He used this to cover his burn.m*rder*r, arsonist, jack of all trades.Yeah, master of none.The Arson Squad confirmed they found traces of acid.So this works for you? Sussman risking jail time for arson just to skip out on a lease? - Money's money.- Small money.And what's this guy doing running a strip joint? - You have to ask? - He wasn't running it alone.He filed a change of ownership two months ago.He used to have a partner.And she spells it with an "I." That's right.Sandi.Sandi Tortomassi.But I'm not a partner in the club anymore.I sold my share two months ago.Problems with your partners? No.Why would you think that? Well, we just heard that the place was packed every night.The only reason you would sell is if you had a beef with your partners.Not to mention there was an attempted arson there a few weeks ago.By the way, is that something burning? You're baking cookies.- Peanut butter.- For my kids.And for the record, I didn't have any beef with my partners.I wanted to pursue other interests.Like baking cookies? Your other partners, that's Daniel Sussman? - Yes.His company.- Firefly Enterprises.The same people who own this house.We happened to notice Firefly put up the money for this place.That was a loan, against the return on share of the club.A loan against your return? By the way, is there a Mr.Tortomassi? He's a drunk, passed out in a trailer park in Ohio.Ohio? Didn't Firefly buy a condo in Dayton? - That was for my mother.- Another loan.You are shouldering a lot of debt.My share of the club went to pay off the other loans.That was the arrangement when I cashed out.So, let's see, he put up the money What was your contribution again? I chose the decor, the ambience.I supervised the employees.Waitresses, bouncers.Strippers.And that's where you have a lot of experience, right? Oh, it's the outfit.Not exactly the standard issue Westchester soccer mom.You're very toned and flexible.Sussman catch your act at a strip club? Is that how you met? You know, if you're trying to humiliate me, I've heard it all before.I want you to leave now, before my kids get up from their nap.How did you find out where Sandi used to work? She never told strangers what she did for a living.Even strippers have to file W-2s.Your manager said you used to share a place with her.Yeah, before she got the house.She had some help with that, from this man, Daniel Sussman? Yeah, sure, Danny.He met Sandi here? Danny'd come in, throw around a lot of money.He really liked Sandi.He told her he wanted to give her the world.And she probably thought he could afford it.Sandi liked him because he was a gentleman.Bought her a house, set her up in a business.That was all his idea.Maybe her idea was to be the next Mrs.Sussman.Sandi respected his marriage.That's why she broke up with him.She didn't want him to put his family through a divorce on account of her.You keep putting your hand on your datebook.Hey! Hey, give me that.That's what people do when they're, you know, they're nervous.They touch things to boost their confidence, especially when they're trying to remember something."Respectful to his marriage." "She dumped him." It's crib notes.And Sandi called you to tell you what to say in case we dropped by.Let's try the truth.She wanted him to leave his wife.No.She broke up with him.After his wife found out what he was doing.- His wife knew? - She called our place.She thought I was the one having the affair with Danny.She called me all kinds of names, I don't even know.You remember any of them? There was one she kept repeating.Kurva, or something like that.I couldn't understand her half the time.She had this accent.Everybody in America knows Yiddish words.Why should Kelly be any different? Kurva? That's a prost*tute, isn't it? Where did Kelly learn a word like that? She was in the family for so long.Maybe she had occasion to hear it.The young woman who got the call said that Kelly had an accent.Kelly didn't have an accent, did she? Okay, I called her.You found out about the affair.I told Danny to stop, and he stopped.Did your daughter-in-law know? He told her.You made sure he did.She had a right to know.You don't start fresh by keeping secrets.Is that what they were doing? They were starting fresh? They have children, a home, people who know and respect them.This other thing meant nothing to Danny.It meant 350 grand for the house in Westchester, $200,000 for the strip club.Kelly knew nothing about that.How could she not? Hundreds of thousands of dollars disappearing from their account.Unless Unless Danny was taking it from the family business.My son lost his head.This really is a family business, isn't it? Relatives have invested their savings.Some of them even work here.If they ever found out what Danny did They wouldn't find out.The money was paid back.It's still a crime.And if Kelly knew what he'd done for this woman, she might not be so forgiving.One word from her, and your son would've gone to jail.No, no, no.Danny would never hurt Kelly.It's that woman.She had her claws into him.She called me here after I spoke to her friend, and she said nobody was going to come between her and Danny.She said that she had friends in that world.People who would hurt anyone who got in her way.Uh-huh.Okay.You want some of this? What are you doing? We gotta get lost for a while.How about Miami? Big party town, dance all night.We could rent a boat and cruise the cooze.Hey, we driving or Maybe if you tell me what you're looking for, I can save you the trouble.That really didn't work out for us.You should go next door with your kids.This warrant says I can stay and watch, - so that's what I'm gonna do.- Excuse me.We found this on the floor of her garage.Is this yours? Be careful.No.It's not mine.We found it in your garage.I don't know how it got in there.That's okay, we do.Sandi Tortomassi, you're under arrest for m*rder.I didn't do it.I didn't have any reason to do it.Getting rid of the wife gave you a clear sh*t at Danny.I don't wanna marry him.Didn't your mother ever tell you? "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?" "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for" So you're saying that you can talk Danny into anything.Well, you saw the house he bought me.And the strip club.My idea.That's just money.Guys toss money at women every day.Well, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.Oh? Like what? Last April, his son's birthday party.His bar mitzvah.What, Danny invited you? I brought two girls from the club.Danny told his family we were with the trucker's union.Well, you really have this little guy under your thumb, don't you? I can see why.Must've been some workout you gave him in that big bedroom of yours.Sure.When the kids weren't around.And where'd you go when you had that place with your friend? You and Danny go to a hotel? Not so often, he'd get tired of it.Good.Then you shouldn't have a problem remembering the hotels and dates.I can't believe she did it.She knew no matter what would have happened I would never marry her, or someone like her.She knew that.So, we're looking for two men.Maybe former bouncers.If you can think of any names, it would help.I can't think of anybody.I can't think.I can't think! You proved that.Getting mixed up with some bottle blonde boom-boom girl.You don't have to tell me.I know that.I shamed my family.I don't know, what was I thinking? Well, it was worth it.Bet this girl gave you quite a ride.No wonder you were still making the drive up to Westchester every other morning.Did you go bareback or use a condom? Condom./ You buy them on the way up there or did you keep a box next to the bed? She had them.Really? That's funny.Because we searched her room.We didn't find anything.Bathroom either.No condom, no diaphragm, no pills.There goes that blink rate again.Do you remember the hotels you stayed in with Sandi before you bought her the house? We've got the itemized bills from your stays.One afternoon, you ordered two movies, rated PG.Room service, two hamburgers, two salads, two desserts, two massages and you used the gym.That's all in the space of four hours.When did you find the time for sex? Or was that between the hamburger and the massage? Another missed opportunity.One of many, right, Danny? Well, how did she wiggle out of it? Did she have cramps? She said the mood wasn't right? She was worried about her kids? She just wanted to cuddle? She really kept you going, didn't she? For two years, Danny.Two years, and not once.Right, Danny? Not a once.It was okay.I didn't mind, really.Oh, come on.What, are you made of marble? You were dying for it.And she kept upping the ante.A condo for Mom, a house for the kids, a strip club for her.A dead wife for you.No.- She talked you into it.- No.I would never hurt Kelly.I respected her.That's the truth.She did so much for me, so much to make a family.Okay, Danny, that's enough.It is now clear you consider him a suspect.He's invoking his right to silence.Him.Her.Him and her.Take your pick.It won't be either unless we find the men who did the actual k*lling.Well, I don't think that he has it in him.I mean, the girl played "keep away" for two years.Ordinary man would be frustrated, angry.He's not an ordinary man, he's a m*rder*r.He's a child.I'm with him.Four hours before Kelly was k*lled, there were two calls from Sussman's office to a no name prepaid cell phone.Can we trace that cell phone to an owner? No.But the number turned up in a h**ker's phone book when she was busted three months ago.Yolanda Starr Corbin.She's a Greenpoint regular.Greenpoint Long Island, New York Thursday, June 27 All God's children need loving.Which one of God's children gave you this number a couple of months ago? We'll just have to call it.Tell whoever answers you gave it to us.Please, don't do me like that.We already have an idea who he is.He's got a burn on his arm, right? It's Big Louis.That's what I know him by.He's armed and crazy.But you have his number.He made me take it.Said if I get in trouble, call him.Guess what? You're in trouble.Louis Bernoff.Priors for drug possession, lewdness.What's wrong with your arm? Car battery leaked.Do you know her? Nope.Him? Nope.How about her? Nope.You should.Those are your handprints around her neck.You k*lled her.We're gonna match your DNA to the rag you left at the strip club when you tried to burn it down.Big trouble for Big Louis.But you can help yourself by telling us which one of these two here hired you.I checked Big Louis backwards and forwards.The phone calls are still the only thing that connect him with Sussman and the girl.- Crystal meth.- No, thanks.It belongs to Big Louis' roommate, Nicky Ross.Big time tweaker according to the neighbors.The second k*ller.Oh, and the neighbor saw Big Louis lugging a large suitcase down the stairs two days ago.Maybe Nicky left the cap off the toothpaste.Large pepperoni.The night before Kelly Sussman was k*lled."Nashot Chayl"? "Nashot Chayl." Nashot, that's Hebrew.- Women, woman.- Figures you'd know that.But Chayl, I don't know.Valor.Nashot Chayl is women of valor.Three years of Hebrew school.Women of valor.Sounds like a self-help group for Jewish women.Nashot Chayl Center Brooklyn, New York Friday, June 28 Kelly came to us two months ago.She wanted a divorce.But she wanted to make sure she did everything right by our Jewish laws.She didn't want any problems getting custody of her kids.Why would there be problems? If she wanted custody, she'd have to convince the religious authorities that she'd continue raising the children in the Jewish faith.Don't family court judges decide custody? Well, judges who are elected by a community listen to their religious leaders.Wouldn't be smart of them to alienate voters.No, it wouldn't be smart.So we help to prepare a get, a Jewish divorce decree.Then she had to present it to her husband for him to sign.Sounds pretty straightforward.Except Kelly had to find two witnesses to go with her.People active in her synagogue.She couldn't find anyone.No one wanted to be her witness.Even her rabbi wouldn't help.The Sussman family They carry a lot of weight in the community.Danny Sussman didn't want a divorce.He wanted a reconciliation.But Kelly had no choice.If she didn't have a get, she'd risk losing her kids in a custody fight.When Kelly cancelled the mediation, did she reschedule? No.So the reconciliation was off? She told me she had a better way of getting what she wanted.Custody of her kids.I told her, no matter what, Danny'd make a problem.You know what, Danny's never been the problem.I mean, he doesn't have the clout or the backbone to bend the community to his will.But his mother does.She cleaned up his mess when he stole money, and now she's fighting to save his marriage.I can't find the invoice for the Gellis account.Do you have it? - Danny? - I can't help it, Mom.She destroyed Kelly.Now she's gonna destroy me.Stop it, stop it.I deserve it.I brought her into our life.- Don't talk like that.- I deserve what happens to me.You deserve what you let happen.We have friends, influence, respect.They don't respect me.They respect the name your father gave you.The name you gave your son.If you can't stand up for yourself, at least stand up for the name.I wish Dad was still here.It's better he's not.Kelly was working in one of the big hotels in New York City when she met Danny.She told me he was very sweet.A real gentleman.She didn't tell me he was a Jewish gentleman.And that bothered you? Well, I was wishing that Kelly would meet a nice Catholic boy.Just like I'm sure Mrs.Sussman wished her son had met a nice Jewish girl.Is that the impression that she gave you? Oh, she didn't warm up to Kelly till after the wedding.We never even got a hug from that woman.Your daughter was a devout Catholic? Well, she grew up in the church.She sang in the choir.She loved the Virgin Mary.Well, then, converting to Judaism must have been a big decision for her.Was that something that Danny pressured her to do? Not Danny.He just wanted to be with Kelly.They even talked about eloping.Mrs.Sussman.She made a big stink.And Kelly was stubborn.But then Kelly gave in.All of a sudden.Did she explain why? No.Two weeks later they were married.No, sir, I'm not sure what evidence they're developing.I know, but Yes, sir.The Brooklyn DA's moving on the girl.They're tangling with some community pressure over there.A community known as Ursula Sussman.You still haven't sold me on that yet.And what's all this? Thirteen-year-old checks from her account.Am I gonna kick myself for asking? This one's for $75,000 made out to cash.Just before her son's wedding Could've been for the dress, for the reception hall.The second check is the same amount.$75,000 to cash three months later, in April.And it's just a week after her Her grandson was born.I need to see my friend, Max.He's a rabbi.We need to get Danny and his mother in here.He knows we have this meeting? He's usually back from lunch by now.I'm sorry.There was a long line at the bodega.Did Detective Eames explain that we needed some things clarified? Yes.About my marriage.Yeah, right.You and your wife were trying to make a fresh start.Yes.We were trying.Your idea or hers? Well, both.We both wanted to go for counseling.Sussman pickles.I've always been a big fan.You made appointments at the Nashot Chayl Center? Yes.Kelly arranged it.The people there told us when she first contacted them, Kelly was dead set on a divorce.Oh, that's between a husband and a wife.These people shouldn't be blabbering about confidential information.Well, I guess it really doesn't matter now, does it? I guess not.You felt Well, you still feel guilty.I mean, you would have given her anything she wanted in the divorce.Even custody of the kids? She was a good mother and fighting over custody would have hurt them.What if Kelly went back to the Catholic church? Under Jewish law, the kids wouldn't have been considered Jewish anymore, would they? She wouldn't have done that.What, someone who'd been hurt? Who was angry, divorced, alone? Who knows what she'd do? Well, thank heaven there was someone in the family still thinking straight.Right, Mrs.Sussman? I mean, if it wasn't for you, Kelly might've run off with your grandchildren and turned them into who knows what.Kelly just needed some time to get over her anger.Well, she got over it, all right.Do you wanna know what she told them at the center? She told them that she had a way of getting what she wanted.Not from you, but from your mother.What do you suppose she meant by that? We don't know.We're not mind readers.Neither are we.But we're pretty good at connecting the dots.First dot, Big Louis Bernoff.You might know him as a m*rder suspect.But six years ago, he was also the owner of a van he bought used from his father, the mechanic.That sound familiar? Because your dad helped Louis' father immigrate from the Soviet Union, I mean, just like he helped hundreds of other refugees.You dad even gave him the contract to service your company's delivery vans.So, that means nothing.Your father helped hundreds of people, thousands.This is - It's just a - Just a Fluke? It could be a fluke if Sandi Tortomassi hired him to k*ll Kelly.But she didn't.Your wife wasn't a thr*at to her.Your wife was a thr*at to your mother.Oh, that's just ridiculous.Kelly had something on her.Something so shameful that Kelly thought your mother might give up her grandkids to keep it quiet.That's not true.I have nothing to be ashamed of.Second dot.Your pregnant Catholic fiancee.Three words that made your mother very unhappy.That's okay.Kelly's mother wasn't too thrilled about it either.Especially when she converted out of the blue.Or should I say out of the green? That summer after you were married, Kelly bought her mother a house for a $150,000? Yes, that was a settlement that she'd gotten for an old car accident.Third dot.Two $75,000 checks drawn from your mother's account 13 years ago.Kelly bought the house with those checks.The first one is dated one week before Kelly converted.The second one is dated two days after your son's Bris, after his circumcision that welcomed him into the faith.If anyone found out, all the good will, all the influence your father garnered from his good work and his religious devotion would have disappeared like smoke in the wind.Your family name would have been disgraced, and the family business.Kelly was gonna tell everyone.Unless your mother let her have custody of your kids.Mom, tell me you She did.She hired Big Louis to k*ll your wife and plant her necklace in your girlfriend's garage.I'll bet that your mother doesn't think that she even did anything wrong.I'll bet that she thinks that she was just cleaning up another one of your messes.Aren't you gonna get angry at her? She k*lled your wife! Come on, Danny.When are you gonna grow up? When are you gonna take your balls back from her? How could you, Mom? How in the hell could you? If you'd only listened.I told you she was no good for you.So I did what I had to do.For the family.Always for the family.What family? You k*lled the family! You're under arrest, Mrs.Sussman, for m*rder.Please turn around.Danny, do something.Danny, do something! She broke the laws of her faith, so what does she do about it? You commit one sin, the next ones come a little easier.

Empty.They're all, except Trust House and Citibank.Those I managed to close before he got to them.I put the money in a safety deposit box.Son of a bitch! And Dougie did all this by himself? Just don't hurt him.Mickey, I didn't know it was yours.Who did you think it belonged to, you worthless twit, Santa Claus? You don't understand.This is the most important thing in my life.That money is my life! And I want it back, every penny, or I swear to God, I'll take it out of your hide.Mmm? You've worked too hard for this.Maybe I should just give it back.Baby, you're slipping.Let me call them.Look, Doug, we need their help.Doug's apartment is empty.Nobody's seen him since yesterday.His mother'll know where he is.He called her.I promised her he wouldn't get hurt.Seabreeze Motel in Montauk, Room 114.Excuse me.You're excused.Stand up, you son of a bitch! Law & Order CI The old man, Mickey Connelly, owns this place.His son Jimmy used it as an office when he was out of the country.The old man was ducking a RICO indictment for bookmaking on the internet.Yeah, well, his legal troubles are over now.Got a m*rder here, su1c1de there.He ate the g*n.Cleaning service found them this morning.Time of death sometime last night.- Thanks.- All right.Can I get a pair of tweezers, please? This must be some of that father-son bonding I've heard so much about.These cuts were made before he d*ed, but for some reason they were untreated.I'll be over here while you do that.It's frosted glass.He has abrasions delicately around the sides of his mouth.Well, he was gagged.Explains why he didn't answer his phone.He's got voicemail.The lab can retrieve the messages.Mickey's passport.Irish customs entry stamp dated November last year.Exit stamp dated two weeks ago.Having fun? I'm listening.He left Ireland two weeks ago.Canadian customs stamp, also from two weeks ago.No US stamp.Make a note to the ME to check for ocular fluids.His eyes are dry and irritated.The mucus is thick.Could be from sleep deprivation.And he's dehydrated.His cuticles have shrunk.Maybe Junior kept him on ice before k*lling him.Except that Junior shows the same signs.Mickey had to have a damn good reason to come back and risk getting pinched on a fugitive warrant.How's two million bucks? That's what the DA's always figured he had stashed away somewhere.Works for me.The old man found out the kid was skimming from him, they got their Irish up.I don't think that they got anything up.The ME found elevated levels of sodium, urea, nitrogen in the eye mucus, kidney and liver enzymes outside the normal range.Stomach and the bowels empty.Now, the Connellys, they were starved, sleep deprived, dehydrated.They sound like POWs.The ME also found minute traces of duct tape around the ankles and wrists of both men.The tech's got the code for Mickey's voicemail.His son's birth date.It's Roseanne again, calling for Jimmy.It's been a week.I need to hear from you.Just call me.Roseanne would be Jimmy's wife.Last Wednesday.It's a week since she's heard from him.You think she would've filed a missing persons report.HOME OF JIMMY AND ROSEANNE CONNELLY HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7 I thought he was away on business.I didn't even know he was with his father.You've been camping out in here? Andy fell asleep watching a video.I didn't wanna move him.I noticed that your bedrooms, they face the street.Is it safer back here? You're terrified.Anybody that has the front to k*ll Mickey Connelly and his son might just come after you, too.You knew Jimmy was in trouble.Maybe you had something to do with it? He called Thursday.He tried to pretend everything was okay, but I knew better.Where was he? He was with Mickey.He said he'd be home soon.There was some problem, some money was missing.He called you just to check in? No, he wanted Andy's Social Security number.He didn't say why.Your son have a back account? They opened an account for the kid when he was born.Last month Jimmy got a safe deposit box under the account.The bank says he emptied the box two days ago.Two days ago he was dead.So who emptied the box? We're checking the bank security tapes.That's him.We know this guy? These are the left ears of both men.Same shape.Similar lobes.Ear structure patterns run in families.Especially siblings.Want some? He'll meet you tomorrow when they break for lunch.Doug, it's almost over now.No one can ever tell you what to do again.His name is Douglas Morgan.He's Mickey's son by his second ex-wife.Jimmy's half-brother.How come we never heard of him? Well, there's no record he's ever been involved in his father's business.Just a couple of misdemeanor forgeries.- He's been a pipsqueak up until now.- You like this guy.Well, a nobody who scammed the scam artist? I'd buy him a drink.First, you have to find him.He moved out of his last known three years ago.No job since last winter.Credit report says he got five credit cards in the last four months.They never learn.If you don't want to be found, pay cash.SEABREEZE MOTEL MONTAUK, NEW YORK MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11 Mr.Morgan, he checked out last Monday.- He was here for a couple of weeks.- By himself? He had visitors.- No, I didn't notice those two.- Who did you notice? Well, this one young man with blond hair, goatee.He spent a lot of time parked out here in a chair, reading.Well, you'd think he'd be warmer inside.I figured Mr.Morgan had company and this fellow was giving him his privacy.Well, that's one way to look at it.This room is very clean.There's no marks.No fingerprints.Same story here.We keep things tidy.Anybody stay here since Mr.Morgan left? Nah.We don't get a lot of traffic out here after Labor Day.When did they replace the shower door? We didn't.There's lime encrustation and soap residue on this door.And there's none on this one and the caulking is still soft.This shower door was broken, and they replaced it.The frosted glass in Jimmy's arm.They were here.They were kept here for two weeks.Two men in a tub.Last year, when Mickey went on the lam, a dozen bank accounts were opened using Doug Morgan's Social Security number.Within two months, there was nearly two million dollars in those accounts.Mickey hid the money under Doug's name without telling Doug, figuring no one would look there.Somehow Dougie found out.Starting four months ago, he emptied all but two of the accounts.Those two accounts were closed the same day Jimmy opened the safe deposit box.We think that Jimmy got wind of what was going on and got the money out before Doug did.And put it in the safe deposit box.So Dougie tortured his father and his brother just to squeeze the last dollar out of them? Well, the last two hundred thousand dollars.What the hell is wrong with this kid? Didn't daddy spend enough time playing catch with him? Or he got too much attention from his mother.His last parole report says he was living with her as of three years ago.How sweet.HOME OF VERA MORGAN QUEENS, NEW YORK TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12 Dougie thought he had a God-given right to freeload off his mother.Uh-uh.Don't walk there.You're gonna make dirt on my carpet here./ Yeah.Put these on.I got them at the hospital.Put them over your feet.There's only three of them.Well, someone could sit on a chair.This is a one bedroom, right? Mmm-hmm.Where did Doug sleep? Where do you think? On the couch.I used to have a bigger place, but after I got out of the hospital cleaning a big place didn't appeal to me.What about his father, Mickey? You been in touch with him? What do I want with that louse? A louse who knows his way to your heart.Thank you.That's $73.It's a bit expensive.I mean, unless it's Canadian dollars.Did Mickey drop it off? I wouldn't set foot in the same room with that man, unless it was to go to his wake.Just your luck.He was found dead four days ago.Oh Dear Mary.Oh.What about his boy, Jimmy? Why, you like Jimmy? He was decent enough.Hadn't been for Jimmy, Dougie wouldn't have even known he had a father.Jimmy brought this to you? Came over looking for Doug? And you knew where he was, because Doug keeps in touch with his mother.Yeah.He told me if Jimmy comes asking for him, to say where he is.And when Jimmy left here, you called Doug and told him that Jimmy was on the way? Dougie wouldn't hurt Jimmy.He loved him! We still need to find him.Mickey left a lot of money behind.Really? You mean, like clean money that could go to Dougie? If we can find him.I don't have his address.It's in Brooklyn.It's a sublet.He said over on Ovington.- A nice, bright place.- You been? He sent the picture.- No return address.- Bird seed.We just ask the neighborhood bird seed store.Look, through the window, across the street, on the roof.A pigeon coop.You've come a long way, Doug.No more self-doubt, no more negativity.Thank you, sir.This isn't just a gift to the program, Doug, this is a gift to yourself.I'm proud of you.I'm sure Lena is, too.You go home.I'll catch up later.There, second floor.It's the same color curtains.All these show is a man resembling my client entering and leaving a room.What he did in there is anyone's guess.We guess he stole the contents of his brother's safe deposit box.Right, Doug? My guess, you got nothing and we're not adding to it.I think your client has something to say.Am I right? You have something to tell us? You think I'm responsible for what happened to my father and Jimmy.- Well, are you? - Now, wait a minute.No, wait.You gotta say it out loud, so we all understand.Don't say a word.When you see things clearly, you make them happen.I did what I had to do.I k*lled them.Okay, he did that against the advice of his counsel.I need to speak to him in a room, right now.Well, that was smooth.You better get Carver down here.Do you have the letter that he sent his mother? This spontaneous statement might not take the place of a confession, but I can't see how his lawyer can step away from it.He's using an interesting vocabulary.Is this something I should be concerned with? Here's another one."Without your encouragement, "I'd still be someone without a future, sleeping on his mother's couch." He thanks her for kicking him out.This about Doug Morgan? It's the letter that he wrote his mother.The first part, he apologizes for the hurt that he caused her.Second part, he thanks her for everything that she's done for him.Last part, he lays out his plan for his future."I now understand I need to develop a new strategy for my life, "a new program for the software of my conceptions." - It's gobbledygook.- It's high-level gobbledygook.This is from a guy who didn't even finish the tenth grade.These are not his ideas.You saw the way he glanced up every time before he spoke? Manson's women did the same thing during their m*rder trials.He's visualizing.Visualizing what? No, not what.Who.What's he looking at? He's looking for support, for direction.He's looking for her.No, no, no.I don't know these people.Mr.Morgan, if someone influenced you, it would mitigate your responsibility.I am responsible.Nobody told me what to do.You did it to transform yourself? That's what it says in the letter to your mother.Your "Negative self programming" was leading you to "a counter-effective life strategy." Yes.You wanted to transform your context.Yes.That's what I did.What's a "context", Doug? You know, Doug, it's in your letter.You don't, you don't know what it means? It's hard to say.Because someone told you to write it? This girl? Is that who you picture when you look up? No.I am the author of my life and I make the choices.And I choose, I don't wanna talk to you anymore.I took another look at Doug's credit cards.Every couple of weeks, there's a four to five hundred dollar charge to one of two out-of-state companies.It'll take a few days to chase them down.Every couple of weeks.All right, try a keyword search.Use "Context transformation." Nearly a thousand results.Now refine it.Add "Tuition".Maybe "Four hundred bucks," the going rate for self-improvement.Here we go."Optimize your psychic drive."Learn the principles of context transformation."Tuition for the two day seminar is $450."GraceNote Powerful Living." What else is on their website? Testimonials, seminar photos.Who do we have here? At the head of the class.The teacher's pet.Bet she took her lessons to heart."Introductory seminars every weeknight." Want to go for a little psychic drive? GRACENOTE SEMINAR, REGENCY HOTEL WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13 I, you know, I don't see her.- Give her a little time, honey.- It's going to start.We're supposed to wait for the person who told us about GraceNote.Just register and go in.I'm sure she'll show up.Well, I would, except Mr.Skeptic here We only knew what she told us, we don't even know her name.Maybe you know her.She said her picture was on your webpage.Could you look it up on your laptop? Hey.Nice to see you.That's her.There, in the front.I don't know her.Well, maybe someone in charge does.What about him? Bye, see you then.That's Randall Fuller.He founded GraceNote.Well, even better.Mr.Fuller, we were invited here by someone who works for you.We don't know that, honey.Well You can see she's helping with the seminar, right there.Anyway, nobody seems to know her Nobody seems to know her You made us, didn't you? - What gave us away? - Her sensible shoes.And her sleeve.It's shiny from rubbing against your holster.Oh, and your belt is scratched where you clip your badge.He's good./ Yeah, well, reading people is part of what I do.And to answer your question, Detectives, she's probably a student volunteer.Since everyone who attends our seminars signs a photo release, we'd have no way of identifying her.What about Doug Morgan? He attended your seminars.Thousands of people have.And right now, some of those people are in there waiting for me.You're welcome to join us.Peggy'll give you some forms to fill out.Four hours without a bathroom break.I thought I was gonna pop a valve.Four hours of constant promises of a better life or a more confident self.It was a sales pitch for their weekend seminar, which is a warm-up for their insight series, the mentors program, the destiny workshops.You could spend thirty grand on the whole nine yards.- Is it a cult, mind control? - No./ Yes.How reassuring.They use the same psychological coercion as cults.So did the guy who sold me my car.No one forced those people to stay last night, - they were enjoying themselves.- They stayed because of peer-group pressure, manufactured peer group.They pay to sit in a room for hours on end.They submit to group hypnosis, deep breathing, guided imagery That's a relaxation technique.Those people did not look like zombies when they came out.No, they were euphoric.They got a sh*t of optimism.It's very powerful.They can't wait to repeat the experience.So they sign up for another seminar.If it helps them, what's the harm? Is it possible it had a more profound effect on Doug Morgan? What, someone susceptible, unhappy, with no clear sense of himself? Look, strip down all the double-talk, what is it that Randall Fuller really said to those people? Everything that you've done is wrong.Everything you are is false.But it's not your fault, you were programmed that way.Leave it to GraceNote to give you back your life.It's very seductive.And they just happened to pick Doug to work their magic on? Every participant signs a release form.The small print gives them the right to run a credit check.They found the bank accounts under his name.They knew before he did how much money he was worth.- And they played him.- He can't be the first one.Check with consumer affairs.If we can establish a criminal pattern, we can bring GraceNote to a crashing halt.DENTAL OFFICE OF DR.PHILIP OLIVER FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15 We went to one of their weekend seminars.I used to feel so isolated, but after that weekend, I never felt so So alive? And the two of you signed up for more classes.No.Just me.I had seminars every night, every other weekend.There were cruises.What kept you going back? Being in that room, being told that my life had limitless possibilities.I needed to keep hearing it.Tell me how they got your money.I was encouraged to make large gifts.Encouraged you, specifically, who encouraged you? Well, at first, the higher-ups in the organization.And eventually, they brought in Randall Fuller.- He was the closer.- Yeah, and he was very good at it.By that point I wasn't thinking very clearly.Why did you drop your complaint? Was there a woman involved? Yes.I thought she was another student like me.I see now I was being handled.Yes.That's her.That's her.Lena Caruso.He needs to see you.I know.I'm meeting him tomorrow.He's going out of town for the day.It has to be tonight.He's sorry.That isn't a problem, is it? A maid found her in a bathtub in a motel room in Long Island City.She'd opened her veins.Yeah, I have hesitation cuts on this one.Yeah.Same here.She probably did it to herself.Lips are cracked, gums are drawn back.Cuticles are cracked pre-mortem.Dehydration, starvation.The GraceNote su1c1de diet.Her family in Cleveland got a letter from her three years ago.Same format as Doug's.I'm sorry, I'm grateful, I'm moving on.That's the last they heard from her.- And the Connelly's money? - Gone.- Into GraceNote's coffers.- That hasn't been proven yet.That's who she worked for.That's why she's dead.Even your dentist thought she was just a student at GraceNote.He also said that Fuller's the one who closed the deals.Look, Doug Morgan, he loved his brother, he feared his father.Fuller's the only one that could've convinced him to k*ll both of them.You believe it.I'm happy to prosecute it.Just get Doug Morgan to confirm it.Four hundred, five hundred, twelve hundred.It goes on and on, Doug.All the money you paid to GraceNote.I took their classes because I wanted to.They helped me a lot.Well, tell us what you learned, Doug.Well, I learned tha I wasn't living a real life.I was making decisions because of things that happened to me in my past.Right, you started questioning everything you did.Am I really making a free choice or am I being controlled by the bad programming in What is it GraceNote calls it, my psychic drive? Yes, because you can't trust the past.There's what happened, and what you tell yourself happened.It was holding me back.- Holding you back from what? - From From being extraordinary.It's hard to explain if you haven't been through GraceNote.Yes.They don't get it.It was worth a lot to you, and you showed your appreciation with gifts.The money that you took from your father, it wasn't for you, you gave it to GraceNote.As a gift.Did Mr.Fuller know where the money came from? I told him my family gave it to me.Doug, you remember the girl from the bank? Her name was Lena.You met her at GraceNote, right? She was taking classes with me.She helped you decide to make those gifts to Randall Fuller.We talked about it, but I decided.Randall Fuller used Lena to convince you to give that money to GraceNote.He manipulated you into k*lling your father and brother.No, no, Lena is in love with me.She decided to be with me.She made that decision.Fuller makes the decisions.That's not true.Doug, listen to me.Lena is dead.She committed su1c1de last weekend.You see how her lips are chapped? The cracked cuticles on her fingers? Those are the same things we found on your dad and your brother.Lena was denied sleep, food, water.- Doug, he broke her.- It's not true.He drove her to su1c1de.It's bad programming.It's just a story from your past.- Doug, it's what happened.- No! You It's how you see it.It's the story you tell.It's how you see it.It's not the way it is.You can't differentiate one thing from another, you I know how it is.I get it.You don't.You're not clear.I'm getting a sense my client might be amending his plea.Not guilty by reason of mental disease? I don't know about an insanity defense, but his credibility as a witness against Fuller is doubtful.Assuming he'd even testify against Fuller.Must be frustrating, a mind even you can't unlock.Well, let's get someone who can.The person who locked it in the first place.GRACENOTE SEMINAR, GRAND HEIGHTS HOTEL BROOKLYN, NEW YORK MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18 your life, your day.Thank you.- Mr.Fuller - I have a car waiting.We'll take you wherever you like.We asked you if you knew a man named Doug Morgan.He attended your seminars, but you didn't remember him.Right, I was in a hurry.You mean, you remember him now? Oh, yes, of course.He made a large donation to GraceNote.He told us a little over two million dollars.Yeah, somewhere in that neighborhood.Why, is there a problem? Yes, see, Doug Morgan stole that money from his father's bookmaking operation.I had no idea.The girl we asked about, that student volunteer, Lena Caruso, she helped him."Helped," that's a bit of an understatement.She manipulated him.I'm really sorry to hear it.You don't know how sorry.Because the money is proceeds from an illegal enterprise./ The bookmaking.The DA is moving to seize it under the RICO act.We're here to serve you with the papers.This money was a gift.You can ask Mr.Morgan.Well, between us, Mr.Morgan isn't making a lot of sense right now.I'm sure your lawyer can work out a repayment schedule with the DA.But this money has been committed.Look, we're innocent victims here.You know what, to tell you the truth, I don't care if you keep the money or not.Right now, we have a problem with Mr.Morgan.He confessed to the k*lling.He confessed to stealing the money.But right now, his present mental state, I don't think his confession's gonna hold up.Mr.Morgan was pretty unstable to start with.Well, I mean, if you just have a look at him for yourself, maybe you'll be able to straighten him out for us.And if I straighten him out? I'm sure the DA wouldn't have a problem with taking a look at your money problem.You can't promise that! I don't want him skipping out on an insanity plea.I'll fix it with the DA.Just think about it.The DA said that if you help them with Morgan, they won't push for restitution.What if we just gave them the money outright? They'll still insist on an audit.If I'm unsuccessful, if Morgan ends up more unstable than before, do I still get to keep the money? According to the DA, all you have to do is try.Mr.Fuller.Hello, Doug.Why don't you sit here.You've been going through a challenging time, Doug.I'd like to assist you.Mr.Cooper, you've explained to your client that we're prepared to accept his claim of sole responsibility for the two murders? Yes, Mr.Carver, I did.Before we proceed, we need precise details of how you committed the crimes.Do you understand? Go ahead.Well, I took my father's money and he found out.Hold on.We said precise details.The money, how did you find out about it? What's the hidden context, Doug? I'm not a competent person.I can't handle money.I was getting my finances in order.I sent away for my credit report.The bank accounts were listed on the report.Weren't you afraid your father'd come after you? I'm still a child, I let fear control me.Yes, that's the context.I wanted to use the money for a good purpose.Something that I'm passionate about.I wasn't afraid.So, when your father came after you I took his g*n, I made Jimmy tie up Dad and I tied up Jimmy.And then you kept them in that motel room for twelve days? Just you, alone, and those two guys? I know this one.I'm not strong.I'm not powerful.No one listens to me.Yes, just me alone.I made them give up the rest of the money.I drove them to Dad's office.And that's when you overcame your biggest fear.You changed your way of being.Yes.You k*lled your dad and transformed your life.Yes, I did.And you k*lled your brother for the same reason.Yes.The brother who loved you, who watched out for you.It wasn't real love.The context wasn't authentic.He watched out for me out of guilt.It's old stuff.It's in the past.You k*lled your dad and you let it go.Yes.Well, so then you became everything that GraceNote promised you.I mean, like it says right here in the brochure.Look, you became the creator of your own destiny.That's right.That's right.Wow, look at you, you're a success story.Doug's a success story.Well, Detective Well, look at him.He's the master of his own fate.Put the past in the past.He transformed his way of life.He created his own destiny.I think he hit the GraceNote trifecta.Yes, Mr.Fuller? In a manner of speaking, sure.So, aren't you gonna use him as a shining example of what can be accomplished with GraceNote's help? I don't know about that.But don't you want your students to follow his example? I would hope they would find another path.Oh? What do you mean? You mean m*rder is not the right path? I would have to say no, Detective.So, he failed.Wasn't k*lling his father a way to free him from the past? Of course not.Do you hear that, Doug? You failed the course.You're the same scared loser you were, when you joined GraceNote.You You told me if I k*lled him, if I k*lled him, I'd make the break.That's not true, Doug.That's a myth you constructed.You told me! You I did everything you told me, Mr.Fuller.Everything? / To get the money, all the money, and to k*ll them.He said it would be the last step to power, to excellence.- That's what you said.- That was a lie, Doug.That was a big lie.And that's why you k*lled Lena.Did you? Did you do it? Of course not.She slashed her wrists, she committed su1c1de.How do you know that, Mr.Fuller? Well, I can't say exactly.She knew someone at GraceNote.They must've told me there.The only people we informed of her death were her parents, but they weren't told how she d*ed.Randall Fuller, you are under arrest for m*rder.What did you do to my life? It wasn't much of a life to begin with.And I'm not sure the rest of yours will be something to write home about.At least Doug learned one of GraceNote's lessons.Taking responsibility for his actions.Something even Randall Fuller couldn't do.Well, he'll have plenty of opportunity to learn where he's going.
02x11 - BaggageQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:20The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.- I checked her out for you.- Dad! Haven't you ever heard of knocking? I'm sorry.I took your car around the block a few times.It's fine.It wasn't fine yesterday.It stalled out on me four times on the way home.Anyway, I've got to get ready for work.Sure.Sure, yeah.I'm sorry I snapped at you, Dad.That's okay.But like I said, your car's running good.I'd give you mine, but Phil and I are talking about driving down to Dyker Beach, gettin' in 18 holes before Oh, it rang before when you were getting ready.You should give her our car.Maybe Phil can take Tommy's.What is it, sweetheart? I'm gonna be late for work.Oh, hey, you're running late? I am so sorry, Keith.I just meant you're in a hurry.I had car trouble on the way in.Oh.I'm just gonna put my things in my locker.Okay.Aren't you gonna get that? Hello? What the hell are you doing here? You're not on break! Get back to work, or so help me God, I will have you fired! No, oh, no.God, not again! Come on.Come on.Come on.Please.Come on.Come on.I saw it on the way in.We're gonna need a tow.Something's leaking.Give me a crowbar.Forget the tow.We need the cops.Law & Order CI We left everything as is as soon we heard you were coming.So how come they yanked you in on this? The victim had a harassment complaint out on her ex-boyfriend.He's a cop.I sure hope a cop didn't do this.Well, her feet are torn.She might've been dragged.Got bruises on her torso.Her nose and jaw are broken.Clumps of hair have been torn out.There are skull fractures front and back.The k*ller didn't pose the body.He just b*at the crap out of her and dumped her in here.He punished her.We got tread marks here and in front of the car.We couldn't get a clear print.The ground's too hard.There's condensation on the window everywhere but here.There was a note? We got her purse, too."Will be back." She had car trouble.So the k*ller pulled up here to help her.She left a note, and they drove away.And he k*lled her.Then he came back.He transferred the body into the trunk.Trusted the wrong Samaritan.Pepper spray.Jenny Sullivan was not a trusting person.She knew this guy.Are the keys in there? Anyone try this? No.She said it kept stalling out.I drove it around the neighborhood for at least 15 minutes.It seemed fine.Who could know that some animal would find her? Jenny had a boyfriend, an ex-boyfriend named Frank Hoyt.Oh, you don't think he had anything to do with We love Frank.Mr.Sullivan, you don't agree.You didn't love Frank? I had some problems with him.Same problems Jenny had? She had a good job at the airlines.Got a big promotion of supervisor.Had to fight to get it, too.And that's when he started bugging her to quit.She filed a complaint against him.What was that about? Well, they had lunch a few weeks after they broke up.He wanted to give it another try.They had an argument, that's all.He was still harassing her.He kept calling her.Just yesterday morning, he got her all upset.She never said it was Frank! Mr.Sullivan, do you blame yourself? I was all worried about my golf game.I should've given her my car.EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM TRANS UNION AIR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15 I've never seen him around here.She talk about him? Yeah.She said he was still in touch with her, which she wasn't too happy about.This is her locker right here.It's a long stretch of road between your parking lot and the expressway.You hear of any incidents, Mr.Ramsey, people being followed? No.The crew use these on the job? No.She put this up? I guess so.There's a new coat of paint on the door.Maintenance crews come through once in a blue moon.Well, they didn't repaint these.Excuse me.- Desmond.- Thank you.Mr McCarthy.You worked with Jenny Sullivan? Yeah, she was one of my supervisors.Her and Keith here.Bad stuff what happened to her.Desmond, you said she got a call yesterday morning, right? Yeah, on her cell phone.You said it freaked her out.She pretty near took our heads off.What was the call? She say anything? No.I thought it was a hang-up.She just flipped.The phone call at work came in at around 9:00.Hoyt was in a departmental meeting, so the call wasn't his.His car was clean.The guy just didn't do it.I'll feel better when we find who did.I just talked to the garage.They can't find anything wrong with her car.So she imagined her car problems? Maybe she imagined being harassed.She didn't imagine the phone calls.Her father said that he tested the car.He drove it around the block a few times.Yeah, it's Goren.Can I have Mike down in the garage? FORENSIC GARAGE FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16 We drained the gas t*nk.That's when we heard it rattling around in there.A ping-pong ball? When you drive over long distances, like the airport road or an expressway, it gets sucked down to the gas line intake, plugs it up, the car stalls.When you stop, it floats back up to the surface.Car starts up again.But if you just drive it around the block Because of the stop and go, the ball never gets sucked down.Car never stalls out.Ralph, that was Jenny's work.They have some forms we have to fill out.What are you doing, sweetheart? I was just looking at her room.Oh, sweetie.I got things to do, okay? I'm sorry.So this went into her t*nk Wednesday when her car started stalling out.But she was k*lled Thursday night.There was a weather pattern Wednesday.The afternoon flights were canceled.She went home early.Her car was probably sabotaged in the employee parking lot.The k*ller couldn't make his move until the next day.So potentially a co-worker.Her father said she had to fight for her promotion.If there was a fight, there was a loser.BAGGAGE WAREHOUSE TRANS UNION AIR TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 20 Personnel told us you had seniority in baggage, but she had more years in the company.She made a stink, she got the job.Your job.It wasn't my job.There was a salary bump with that promotion./ Would've been.Oh, man, instead you got stuck in this little hellhole.I don't mind.I like the guys.Loyalty counts for something.Can I bum a smoke from you? I mean, you can smoke in here, right? So what do you supervise here, Mr.Tate, lost luggage? No, no, don't sweat it.You were just biding your time."Indecent Exposure Gentlemen's Club." - We passed that on the way here.- I didn't notice.You guys hang out there? Yeah, sometimes.Jenny must've felt right at home at a titty bar.Oh, right.That's the point.She wouldn't.Right, Walter? You know what? We're gonna let you get back to work.And thank you for your help.I almost forgot.I once busted a stripper.Her specialty was this thing with a glow stick.They do that there? Yeah, they do that.I can't believe you touched that thing.Ms.Sullivan did make a sexual harassment complaint but not against Walter Tate.The person involved got a warning.Can we see the complaint? It's against our policy.Well, what did this person do to Ms.Sullivan? I can't get into that, but the general sense was that Ms.Sullivan was overly sensitive.Let me guess.It had to do with her locker.Somebody wrote graffiti on it, and that's why it was repainted.Someone slipped something through her vent, and that's why she blocked them.We're betting a thousand anyway.You might as well let us see it.You understand I'm bending our rules.I think your rules are used to it.Playboy pinups in the break room, dirty cartoons That's from our inspection of the workplace.Her complaint wasn't about that.Well, I guess she wasn't all that overly sensitive.The complaint was against Desmond McCarthy.The big guy in the locker room.Yeah, he exposed himself to her.He put the glow stick on her car seat.He poured urine through the vents of her locker.Jenny catalogued everything he did.Every obscene gesture, every piece of graffiti, dates, times, witnesses.Did she have notes or a journal? He told us she had a spiral notebook with her.Oh, I didn't ever saw anything like that.She ever say anything to you about her problems at work? We talked about other things.Who makes the bed? Jenny does.She likes things neat.Eames.So this is where she hid the notebook.What's going on? We've been talking about how good Jenny was doing at her job.You must be proud of her.Sure.I was proud.My dad's a retired cop.When I've got a beef at work, I go to him.Is that what Jenny did? She came to you with her problems? Yeah, sure.Everybody has a bad day one time or another.You can't let it get to you.That's what you taught Jenny? Don't show weakness? Be strong? When she told you some guy at work was ragging her, you told her to just tough it out.The guy was just a jerk.Did you know she filed a complaint against him with the company? You're not surprised.You know what's on the complaint.You read her notebook.- No.- Yes, you did.And now you're taking it on yourself because you're thinking maybe you should've listened more carefully to what Jenny said.And that's why you're not telling anyone about it.I didn't know.She tried to tell me.I'm sorry.I'm sorry."While in the break room, McCarthy started telling me "about a video about women who used sex toys."When I told him to stop, he exposed his genitals to me."I left the room."August 12, 5:10 p.m."While on my way to the locker room, "Jack Martinez stopped me to discuss a work order."Later, when I approached my locker, I saw McCarthy leaving."When I opened my locker, I found everything soaked in urine." What a living hell.The airline just gave this bozo a slap on the wrist.That sends a message.Well, no wonder McCarthy's buddies got in on the act.Here."Walter Tate, McCarthy and Martinez engaged in "a lively discussion of their r*pe fantasies." Martinez is the guy who distracted her.While McCarthy messed with her locker.And here.On her way to the parking lot, Tate and Bill Stuart told her what they saw at the strip club.When she got to her car, the glow stick was on the seat.These guys conspired to harass her.Maybe not just to harass her.You see what she wrote here? It's a week before she d*ed.The address on Fordham Place.It's the State Human Rights division.She was filing a complaint with the State.She was going for the jugular.And they went for hers.Who told you this? Guy who works the desk at human resources.I give him a ride sometimes.- This is crap.- What did he say exactly? They found the complaint she made on bright boy here.I'm not taking the fall for this.Just relax, would you? You relax, Martinez! No, you know what? Don't relax.'Cause if they try to hang this m*rder on me, I'm not the only one going down.What motive? You just said the Human Rights division never heard from her.She hadn't made up her mind yet.She was scared.She'd been b*rned before.But if these guys got wind she was even thinking of going to the State Appalling as their behavior is, it doesn't predispose them to m*rder.They threatened her with r*pe.They f*ndled her./ Yes, they did.But there is not a single case on the books proving a causal relationship between sexual harassment and m*rder.Not a single case until now.Not with this evidence.These men may have been pigs, but that doesn't make them K*llers.I'm sorry.Her notebook mentions her confiding in the other supervisor, Keith Ramsey.It's interesting.He never said anything to us.Sure.I knew what was going on.It was hard to miss.And she told you about it? We talked about it.She wrote it in her notebook.She kept a very detailed chronicle.Yeah, well, then you know I wasn't involved.Right, we got that.What we don't get is why you didn't tell us.Because it didn't have anything to do with her death.You know, I told corporate what was going on.It was up to them to come down on those guys.Why didn't you? You're their supervisor.Are you afraid of them? I can take care of myself.But you didn't take care of Jenny.She wrote in her notebook you're the only guy she trusted.Or maybe you enjoyed seeing her get tormented.Where is this coming from? Eames, please.We need to call in anyway.This case has brought out the What's the code word? Feminist in my partner.Well, it's all right.You know, she's an attractive woman in what used to be a man's job.It can't be easy.Attractive? If hostility turns you on.That's not what I meant.If you wanna know, that's more my type.Not bad, if you like high-maintenance ball-busters.No.You see, I like women.They don't always get a fair shake.So you have no problem with Jenny working in How did you put it, what used to be a man's job? Of course not.I told those guys that she deserved a chance.You know, I hope you're wrong about those guys.I have to go.The new age man.He likes women, he understands them.He tried to help Jenny.And still she's dead.Another ineffectual nice guy.I wonder how helpful he really was.HUMAN RESOURCES TRANS UNION AIR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 22 These memos from Keith Ramsey are about work procedures.Where are the ones about sexual harassment? We never got anything from him about that.These memos concern his comments on work proposals made by Ms.Sullivan."Putting more security in the baggage terminal "will result in additional costs."Ms.Sullivan's proposal requires further study." Ms.Sullivan, she wanted more security in her department? Apparently, yes.She thought incoming mailbags were spending too much time in the terminal.She proposed rescheduling pick-ups by the post office.Ramsey said that she overstated the problem.Every chance that he gets, he submarines her.What's the date on her memo about the mailbags? August 25.McCarthy poured urine in her locker on the 27th.Her security memo? September 15th.On September 18, she found the glow stick in her car.They were harassing her in response to her memos.Mailbags and security.Touchy subjects.Identity fraud? You have my attention.Jenny complained that her workers were taking unscheduled breaks.These breaks coincided with flights arriving from Sioux City and Bakersfield.All the flights carried mailbags.Sioux City is a distribution center for major credit card companies.Bakersfield is headquarters for two credit reporting companies.That's what was in those mailbags, credit cards and credit reports.Which were being stolen.Which is what Jenny Sullivan uncovered? There's no evidence that she knew what was going on.She was doing her job.Getting in the way.They tried to drive her out by harassing her.When that didn't work, they k*lled her.The FBI has to be brought in on this.Who's the ringleader, Ramsey? The m*rder seems out of character for him.The evidence against him won't support an arrest warrant anyway.We'll start with the others.She was wound too tight.I just ragged on her so she'd loosen up, you know.Yeah, loosen up.Is that why you think the FBI's here? It's the mailbags, Desmond.That's why you wanted her to loosen up.That's why you k*lled her.I never went near those bags.I took those breaks 'cause I have a medical condition.Right, the Sioux City mailbag syndrome.I hear it's contagious.Your buddies all caught it.I swear I never opened those bags.You're the only one of those guys who touched her.And k*lling her was that much easier? It wasn't me.I got nothing to say about mailbags.But the k*lling, I'm not taking the hit for that.That was Walt.Walter Tate.He messed with her car.I did not steal from mailbags.That's a federal crime.I'm no idiot.I got a wife and kids.Maybe you didn't steal, Walter, but maybe you know those other guys did.Desmond and Stuart.You're not gonna get me to say anything about anybody.Well, you got a lot more character than your buddies, Walter, I'll give you that.One of them told us that you were seen putting something in Jenny's t*nk.That's a damn lie! You talk to Bill Stuart.You ask him why he washed out the trunk of his car the day after the m*rder.That's right.People saw him.I'm not going down for this.I did not k*ll her.If you know who did, Bill, now's the time.Martinez.It's Martinez.Martinez drove out after her that night.Somebody saw him.I just put the mailbags in a room and those other guys, they took stuff out of them.No.See, Martinez, you did more than just push mailbags around the terminal.There's what you did to Jenny.That sex stuff? Yeah, that wasn't my idea.I liked her.Everybody was giving her such a hard time, and she still brought us homemade cookies.Cookies? Keith said it was a peace offering.Something must've been wrong with her baking because somebody saw you following her that night.They didn't see me.Desmond.He's the one followed her.There isn't enough against Ramsey.But with Martinez's statement, the Bureau can proceed against McCarthy, Stuart and Tate for mail theft and fraud.As far as the m*rder, well, that's your jurisdiction.Thanks for your help.Well, at least they said thank you.So now we have four m*rder suspects.And four witnesses and four sets of facts.This is not a promising development.These guys could've orchestrated this.Not these four.Someone fed them those stories.The same mind that put the ping-pong ball in Jenny's car is now playing ping-pong with us.I had a very nice time.It's not that.I just have a big day tomorrow.I'll call you later this week.Keith, I'll call you, okay? I better get my coat.Keith.Keith.Tell me some news, Keith.We need to get back to business.I told you I can't get the documents right now.It's too dangerous.The cops are questioning my guys.Your guys, they can hurt you.My guys only know what I tell them.You don't have to worry about them.Okay.Then I just worry about you.Our new best friends at the FBI traced the usage of the card numbers stolen from the airport.So far they're showing over a million dollars in long distance calls to Eastern Europe.Our boys must be fencing the cards to the Russians.Such lovely business partners.What're you looking for? Cookies.Martinez said that Jenny made them cookies.But it's not in here.Maybe she had other things on her mind.She wrote down everything else.Here.Ramsey told her he discussed her harassment with a woman's rights lawyer.More bull.She wrote down the lawyer's name.Lucia Hastings.Can you look it up in the bar association directory? Probably the only bar Lucia's associated with is the cocktail lounge at the airport.Well, what do you know.Lucia Hastings.Associate at Markham & Frasier.APARTMENT OF LUCIA HASTINGS MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26 Like I said on the phone, I don't know Keith very well.Is one of his employees suing him? Executives are such easy targets.Executives like Keith? He mentioned ever since he became a - I'm so bad with titles.- Vice President.Yeah, I know.But of what? Do you still have his card? Vice President of Operations.I'm curious.How did my name come up? You made an impression on him.But then again, you are his type.You met socially? At a club.Ahmad's in SoHo.Couple of months ago.So what's he done? Embezzled company funds? I'm surprised that you'd say that.'Cause, you know, he's such a nice guy.Well, sure, he was nice.Nice enough to date? I let him take me out to dinner.How did the evening end? Not the way he hoped.And when you told him that you weren't interested, how did he take it? He just got very quiet.I gave the waiter my card to pay for the drinks.I thought that was the least I could do.Then I went to the powder room.When I got back, Keith was gone, and I haven't heard from him since.Later on, did you notice anything missing from your purse? / No.How about your wallet? Credit card that you left on the table? No.It was there when I got back.How about when you got your bill at the end of the month? Well, as a matter of fact, someone had charged a bunch of phone calls to Sarajevo of all places.Of all places.He stole her credit card number and passed it on to his Russian buddies.He masquerades as an airline exec.That's what he does for sport? Well, it's not a sport.It's how he sees himself.The waitresses at Ahmad's said he comes in a couple of nights a week, in a business suit, flashing a roll, chats up one or two ladies and usually goes home alone.Home being The Dakota across the hall from Yoko.At least that's what he told the bartender.I wish we could give him a new home.The phone charges on Lucia Hastings' card tie him to the mail theft ring.That still leaves the m*rder.Ramsey doesn't like confrontation.It would take something deeply threatening to trigger the kind of rage that k*lled Jenny Sullivan.I don't know what that trigger could be.I can't see it yet.Thank you.And one for the lady? - No, thanks.- Please.I've been on the phone all day trying to avert another airline strike.And the only thing that'll make me feel better is if I can buy a beautiful woman a drink.Well, thank you.Thank you for accepting.I am Keith.Steffi.What airline do you work for, Keith? Trans Union.I'm Vice President of Operations.There's gonna be a strike? Right now, I couldn't care less.Hi, Keith.How fabulous to run into you.I just got off the Concorde.You know, when you finally take over that airline of yours, you should really buy a couple of those.They are so fabulous.And who's this? - Hi, I'm Alex.- Steffi.Steffi.What a cute name.And you remember Bob? Bob, the shipping magnate? / Hi, Keith.Did Alex tell you what she does for a living? She's a queen.Queen of Sheba.They're pulling your leg.No, no.Shipping magnate.Queen of Sheba.And what was it, Vice President of Trans Union Airlines? It's so fabulous.Why don't the three of us go back to our place and talk about our fabulous jobs? You know, you two are very funny, but Steffi and I We even brought you an invitation.We insist, Keith.I'm sorry.Backlog in night court.Two hour wait to get an attorney appointed to represent you.But I ran into two attorneys I know who are taking cases.Mr.Drotos, Ms.Broderick.Both excellent.They've looked at the complaint.Your choice, Mr.Ramsey.Mr.Drotos, why don't you have a seat? All right.No, wait.I don't want him.I want her.- Do you two need a minute? - Yeah, that would No.I don't need a minute.I didn't have anything to do with any mail theft.These charges are ridiculous.So if you had $3,600 on you, we shouldn't think anything of it? A friend repaid a loan.And this money clip, these cufflinks.They're from Bulgari.How much do you make a year? Fifty, sixty grand? Those are gifts.From your many admirers? This It's a Kiton jacket.That's $5,000.Was this a gift or did it fall out of a suitcase in the lost and found? Mr.Ramsey, you shouldn't answer any of their questions.Keith, I'm not sure, but I think I detected a tone of condescension in her voice.Detective.You know, Keith might just be a supervisor of baggage handlers, but he's really a lot more sophisticated than you give him credit for.Let's stay on point.All right, the point is, is that he is a high-flying airline executive trapped in the life of a nobody.I mean, isn't that right, Keith? You are reading way too much into this.It was a hustle.If you just wanted to get lucky, you should've hit on the waitresses at Ahmad's.They think you're pretty cute.He doesn't want waitresses.Do you? You want thoroughbreds.Why not? And that's why you stole the credit cards to bankroll this man of the world you needed to be.I had nothing to do with that.Do you remember Lucia Hastings? You mentioned her to Jenny.Jenny wrote about everything.He lifted her credit card number.I did no such thing.These are the calls to Eastern Europe that were charged to her card.The same phone numbers also appear on the bills for credit cards stolen from the mailbags at the airport.I did not lift Lucia's credit card number.I'm not some creep.Before we arrested him, we searched your apartment.Not the one at The Dakota, the other one.And we found these things in a drawer in your bedroom.It's a Chanel scarf.A young woman left it behind.A silver business card holder with the business cards.A gold Dunhill lighter.I tried to return that.Mr.Ramsey, I really think we need to talk before this continues.This must be really embarrassing for you.For a classy woman to see you for what you are.It's not what you think.You know what I think? I think that you really resent women who frustrate your plans.Like Lucia, like Jenny.I tried to help Jenny.Isn't that what the notebook says? That I helped her? You wanted her out of the way.It was those other guys.I told her not to provoke them.But she baked them cookies.How was that provocative? Where'd you hear about that? Did she write about it? No, she didn't.You told the guys that they were a peace offering.Yeah, I told Jenny they wouldn't appreciate it.You were worried there for a moment.No, what do you mean? That she'd written about the cookies.She wrote about everything else.Each instance of sexual harassment but not one word about the cookies.What is the big deal about a tin of cookies? She didn't bake them for the guys.She baked them for you.No.That's why she didn't write about it 'cause it was private.I mean, she had a thing for you.I don't know anything about it.Well, why not? A man of the world.How could you miss it? No, no, you gave her a shoulder to cry on.Right? And she looked up at you with those big cow eyes.- That's insulting! - No, no, no, you see, I get it now.She liked you.But the funny thing is, with all her memos and complaints, she was gonna screw everything up for you.- No more Steffis.- Not true.No more man of the world.The only thing that would be left would be Jenny Sullivan.The booby prize.That would never happen.Jenny thought it could.How could she? How could she think that I would even be seen with somebody like her? Well, why not? I mean, maybe she didn't look so hot in a cocktail dress, but unlike those uptown girls, she would've gladly jumped into the sack with you with both feet.Never in a million years would I let something like that happen.- Mr.Ramsey - Shut up.So why were you so resistant? Is it because you thought she was crummy? Like your job, like your office? - She just didn't belong.- Like you? You were afraid that people would think that girl is the best a crummy, little nobody like Keith could ever hope for.No.I am better than that.Well, Jenny presumed to think otherwise, and so you taught her a lesson.It was those other guys.Keith, she would've never gotten into their car.She didn't trust them.She only trusted you.And that's why we know you did it, Keith.You looked at her and you saw yourself.Your true, crummy self.And that made you angry at her.She got in your way, right? And you got angry at her.She loved you, and you were angry at her.She trusted you.Angry.- So you b*at the life out of her.- God! No! - You punished her! - That dumpy bitch! Why didn't she just quit? Why didn't she Don't look at me that way! Don't look at me.That's the problem with most men.They want what they can't get, and don't want what they have.No.The problem with men is they talk too much.
02x12 - Suite SorrowQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:21In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.She is not to know about this.How much do you usually get? Think of a number you're comfortable with.Now double it.Just now, up in her office.This is what she thinks of me.Oh, God.She has no boundaries.It's not gonna work.I mean us, Julie.I'm sorry.We make a good team, Kenneth.You're fooling yourself.Nan will make our life a living hell.I'm sorry, Julie.I really am.Kenneth.He loves me, Mother.Is that so hard to believe? - Your judgment is off.- Right.I disagree with you, so I must be wrong.It's my life.Do you hear me? Everyone hears you, Julie.But as long as you live under my roof, and work for me, you You can't control me! Is this a bad time? Julie was just leaving.She only wants what's best for you.Dad, how can you take her side? I'm not.The last week, when the talk about selling the hotel came up What? She didn't She said she would discuss it with you.She can't do this! You can't let her upset you like this.Come on, you've got everything going for you.You're young, you're talented, you're gorgeous.Guys would k*ll for the chance to date you.You know that, don't you? No.No second thoughts.I just Of course I trust you.I will.Mr.Turner! Mr.Turner! The room below, they call about the water, but / Slow down, Carlos.Slow down.There is a leak into the suite below yours.I called Mrs.Turner many times, no answer.I didn't want to disturb her.Nan? Nan! Mr.Turner! Nan! Law & Order CI There's no obvious signs of a struggle.The wine glass didn't even spill.Other than the corpse in the tub, the entire suite is fit for a princess.Just like the ads say.She drink and drown? The body fights drowning.The throat closes to keep the water out.The victim suffocates.Which means she should've surfaced.Which she hasn't.Lungs are filled with water and her throat didn't close.Forehead has blisters, pinpricks.Botox sh*ts.Just a guess, going by that nice smooth look in all her photos.Botox works by paralyzing the nerves around the facial muscles, doesn't it? Does it look like I'd know? Xanax, Ambien, heart pills.A real pinata bowl.The bed was slept in.You Major Case? I'm Cooper.That's my boss in the tub.I'm the house d*ck here.Used to be at the 24.- I'm the one who called you.- On a drowning? The husband doesn't want any insurance questions later.For example? She was suicidal? She makes other people suicidal.That include her husband? Ask him.He's in the study, about a half a mile down that hallway.Nan did not do this to herself.She never would have given her enemies the satisfaction.She must've slipped or Or something.The manager said you got home around 3:00.Yes.Poker night at the Explorers.Every week for 20 years.So your wife was here by herself? Yes.What about your daughter? Julie was with her fiance, Kenneth Rayfield.She's at his loft now.She's She's far too upset to do any good here.Your wife have enemies? When Nan's father d*ed, she took over the old dame.It's been a battle.With whom? Unions? The suppliers? The competition.She was determined to keep the hotel in the family.This belonged to Admiral Peary? He took it to the pole.Nan's father acquired it.And you use it as a, you know, letter opener? Your competitors, have they made a play for the hotel? There is talk that the Grimwalds are about to make an offer but you'll have to try Julie on that.Can't we try you? When the family trust was set up, the hotel passed directly to Nan and then to Julie.I'm not part of that loop.One last thing.Did your wife get Botox injections? A gentleman does not ask a lady to reveal her secrets.I saw Mom just before 8:00.She was in a good mood.And then you went to your fiance's? I'd just gotten back from the gym.We ordered Chinese, watched a DVD.A quiet night.- It wasn't that quiet.- Kenneth.Your father told us that your mother was gonna keep the hotel in the family.That's right.What are your plans? I grew up in the Townson Hotel.It's my home.I'm not selling it.Maybe a competitor thought they could change your mind.The Grimwalds, for example.If the offer was generous enough? What did the Algonquin sell for last year, $30 million? Forty.And it's hardly in the same league as the Townson.I'm an equity analyst at Mason Stone.Oh.Helen Grimwald's always had her eye on the Townson.But she underestimates me, like everyone else.So Nan It wasn't an accident, is that what you're inferring? You mean implying.The listener infers.And detectives speculate, since we don't know the cause of death yet.We'll be in touch.We're so sorry for your loss, especially now you're getting married.We haven't set a date yet.We just met three months ago at a benefit and we Wow, three months.A whirlwind romance.Well, we We both just knew.Well, you're lucky to have each other.He knew when he got a look at her mother's hotel The ME's got the tox screen results.This holds 100 units of botulin.It's good for four treatments.Nan Turner had over 3,000 units in her system.Would this fill a whole syringe? Sure.It's freeze-dried.Just add saline solution and find a vein.What about these pinpricks on her forehead? Oh, those would be from a regular treatment, probably the day she d*ed.The lethal dose went into her jugular.Now, she had sleeping pills, wine.She was probably injected in her sleep.Yeah, the botulin caused a descending paralysis.First she can't open her eyes, then she can't speak, can't swallow.And can't close her throat.But she can still breathe.So the k*ller dragged her to her bathtub, pushed her under and her lungs filled with water.Death by Botox.Live slow, die old, leave a good-looking corpse.Thanks to your friendly local dermatologist.Oh, I checked with her doctors.They never gave her Botox.Well, there's always the hotel beauty salon.TOWNSON HOTEL THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21 I'm not licensed to dispense Botox.Yeah, we've found that a lot of people do things that they're not licensed to do.Especially if their landlord insists.My salon never treated her.Not only does he remove hairs, but he splits them.Your cosmeticians, technically, they're independent contractors, right? Yes.If you had to pick one? Jason.He's got a following.House calls, parties.Julie, I want you to think.Imagine the worst thing that Kenneth could do, and then ask yourself, would you still love him? What's done is done.What matters is, would you still love him? Would you? Then do whatever needs to be done.He's incredible.Isn't Jason the perfect little miracle-worker? He has quite a following.Are these to-dos always so crowded? No.Half of us were here last Wednesday.My dear, I would k*ll to have your skin.Laser abrasion, am I right? No.If you just saw Jason, why would you need another treatment? Because Wednesday he showed up empty-handed.Oxygen facial? No.So what happened? He left his whole supply in a cab.I know.You had a lymphatic drain facial.Sorry, just soap and water.Now serving number 10.I'll be done in a jiff.Aren't we eager? I couldn't take the risk you'd run out like last Wednesday.What a nightmare! I'm surprised it didn't make the evening news.There's still a chance.Jason here ran out of Botox the night Nan Turner d*ed.What is going on here? A m*rder investigation.The Baronet.Isn't that a Grimwald hotel? Yeah, what isn't? I gave a party in one of their suites.The Vam Dam, another Grimwald hotel.Boy, you are just in too cozy with the Grimwalds for your own good.He left those vials in a cab.How often do you need to hear it? Helen Grimwald was your regular customer.I mean, you saw her the Monday before you saw Nan Turner.Come on.It's written right there in ink.Did she know that Nan was your client? He's not gonna answer that.He's gonna want to say something.He's already on the hook for nine counts of dispensing a controlled substance.It's just Botox, for God's sake.Just Botox? You mean anyone could do it? Even me? This stuff was derived from something developed for germ warfare in the '50s.A jury might not think it's so harmless.Especially when they find out Nan d*ed after having 30 vials of it jammed into her neck.I, look I I lugged those vials around all day in this.First in the fridge at the Townson's beauty salon.Then I had some sessions at the Baronet.I stored them in their spa.After that, the Plaza.Well, you get the idea.The idea being that the vials could've been stolen at any point.Yes.Not that I'm pointing fingers, but Helen Grimwald knew that Nan was a client of mine.She was always asking me about Nan's health.It was morbid.She thought as soon as Nan kicked, she could grab up the hotel? Yeah, I tried to tell her Julie Turner would never sell.Julie lived to renovate.But Helen said that she had a little bird who told her to be patient.A little bird.Yes.Apparently the same one who saved her a lot of money when she bought the Baronet.Okay, thank you.Three years ago, when the Grimwalds bought the Baronet, they got a bridge loan through Mason Stone.Kenneth Rayfield's firm.Yeah, that's Helen Grimwald's little bird.Once the old lady's out of the way, he'd sweet-talk the daughter into selling the hotel.And he gets a commission from the Grimwalds and a $40 million dowry.Except that he k*lled Nan before marrying the daughter and locking in the profits.Nan was in bad health.He could've let nature take its course.Something forced his hand.Kenneth? Julie adores him.You trust her judgment? Three months, they're already engaged? Julie's had some bad luck in the past.She's been divorced? No, she was engaged about three years ago.Came to her senses just in time.Was this guy also in the real estate field? Junker? He played the field, he didn't have one.How'd you find out? We found out because Nan did her due diligence.You didn't tell Julie? With Julie, if you push one way, she tends to go the other way.We felt it better to let her Come to her senses? You know There's a check stub missing.It's been ripped out.And the checks before and after were written the day of your wife's m*rder.It's check 768.Do you know anything about it? The trust account was strictly Nan's domain.OFFICE OF LLOYD PRESCOTT FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 29 It's been over a week.That check should have cleared by now.The day the check was written, were there any other transfers into the account? Mrs.Turner transferred $100,000.Did I say something amusing? Not yet.Could you look up a check? A three-year-old check? The name of the payee? Well, we only have the first name.Junker, with a J.Just be happy his name isn't Messerschmitt.There.Junker Dalton.$30,000 for traveling expenses.As in, "Hit the road, Junker." Nan's M.O.She pays Julie's fiances to go away.Ken didn't go.Why take the consolation prize when you can stay in the game and marry $40 million? So Kenneth k*lled Nan and Julie's covering for him.My father told me all about your suspicions.You're desperate.You don't care whose life you destroy.We care who destroyed your mother's.When Ken came over that day she d*ed, it was around lunchtime? People saw him in the lobby.Yes, he was here to have lunch with me.Oh, good, because the people who saw him weren't sure what day it was.Oh, is that how it's going to be? We're going to play tricks? Well, like you said, we're desperate.Anyway, so the two of you met in the loft.That was around 8:00? He just came back from the gym, he took a shower? / Yes.- Yes? / No.- No? What? - He showered at the gym.- Take your time.And then you ordered in Chinese from Maple Duck? Yes.Did we tell you? We got it off his credit card bill.You see, we did a little snooping.The restaurant told us this Look at this That the order was made just after 10:00.Well, as Ken alluded crudely, we were preoccupied.Oh, yeah, well Oh, that's right.You took a tumble between 8:00 and 10:00.The restaurant also told us the order was picked up in person.Well, they're confused.Ken was with me the whole evening.Then we're confused, because his gym said he scanned himself in just after 9:00.Oh, someone must have stolen his membership card.Next you're gonna tell me someone stole his cell phone and called you at quarter to ten.No, I used his cell phone.I misplaced mine in his loft, so I called it, so it would ring, so I could find it.You're turning every little innocent thing into evidence of nothing.While you waited for Ken at his loft, Ken k*lled your mother and then ran around establishing his alibi.'Cause he was afraid that you wouldn't lie for him.I'm not lying.Ken wouldn't hurt my mother.You're into homeopathy.There's Lycopodium, Iris, Satrum.Leave my things alone.Well, they're expired, anyway.You don't use them? No.Just put them down.You know, your mother was right.You have no judgment when it comes to men.How would you know what my mother Your last fiance What was his name? Junker.She paid him 30 grand to get lost.How would you know about That was a loan.- She knew - A con when she saw one.Is that why she wrote Ken a check for $100,000? Ken ripped up that check.Doesn't that tell you something? Well, what's one check when you can marry the checkbook? How dare you! Ken loves me! Is that so hard to believe? He understands me! He loves me! We're sorry.We'll show ourselves out.She's not covering for him.He's covering for her.RIKERS ISLAND CORRECTIONAL FACILITY MONDAY, DECEMBER 2 I never gave her treatments.Julie's an attractive young woman.She doesn't need Botox.I saw Julie's homeopathic stash.All the treatments for migraines.And the heavy curtains in her suite, to block out the light.She suffered from migraines.I wouldn't know.We checked with the hotel pharmacy.It's been four months since she refilled her migraine prescriptions.She found something better, didn't she? She found Botox.We heard for some people, it works miracles.That day that Nan d*ed, Julie came to you.She said she had a bad one and you just wanted to help her.She said they hurt so bad that they make people want to k*ll themselves.She asked to buy your whole supply? She threatened to make trouble for you? I just wanted to help her.And then later, I realized You helped her commit m*rder.The happy couple.We brought you new engagement rings.Julie Turner, you're under arrest for m*rder.You're gonna have to come with us, too.Ken, don't leave me.It's nice being loved so much.Ken! I just told Helen Grimwald Nan had concerns about Julie's ability to run the hotel.Nan might've been enticed to sell it before Julie could run it into the ground? Yes.Did Julie know what her mother was thinking? I don't know.We talked about other things.Like about the $100,000 check? Julie told us about that.Not one of my finest moments.I acted rashly.Ripping up the check was a noble gesture.I mean, giving Julie back the engagement ring.But Nan would've made our life a living hell.Julie didn't tell you? Let's see if we have this straight.Her mother was planning to sell the hotel out from under her and she drove her fiance away.Did we miss anything? I know what you're implying.But Julie is just not capable of hurting her mother.So, again, what time did Julie show up at your loft? And this is an answer that you wanna give a lot of thought to.I I called her just after I left the gym.She was out walking.I told her to meet me at my place.She She got there just after 10:00.Sounds like the right answer.Whose idea was it to lie? Julie was afraid she'd be accused.I Now, I told her that was ridiculous.But she was so upset.She I said, "We should just say that we were together." I knew she'd never have hurt Nan.I bought enough for one headache, okay? I was under a lot of stress with the wedding preparations and the redecorating.Redecorating your mother allowed you to do while she was making provisions to sell the hotel? Just a rumor.- My mother had complete faith in me.- Your mother I No.No, it's too easy.Why? What's too easy? To get you to go on about your mother.You should wait for your lawyer.I don't need a lawyer to tell the truth.No, you need a lawyer because it's hard for you to know what the truth is.It's not your fault.I mean, how could you, with a mother like Nan? Don't patronize me.I've had enough of that.Hey, I'm trying to let you know that there's a lot of sympathy for you in this room.You had a parent that lied to you.Undermined you.Questioned your judgment to the point where you didn't even trust it yourself.She didn't want you to be happy.I did not hate my mother.I did not k*ll her.I was with Kenneth.That's not true.Ken told us.Julie, we can see that you're not a cold-blooded k*ller.You were provoked.I didn't k*ll her.And she drove Kenneth away.Kenneth told us that he broke off the engagement.That was just a test.She wanted to see if he'd take the money.A test? Like the $30,000 she loaned Junker? No, she was right about him.That he took the money? That and he was cheating on me.According to Nan.She showed me pictures, okay? So if she had anything on Kenneth, she would've shown it to me.So it was just a test.And he passed.Then she realized I was right.She realized he loves me.This is Mr.Edwards, her family lawyer.Your father's just outside, Julie.He doesn't want you to say another word.Until we get a criminal attorney, she's reasserting her right to remain silent.What do you mean, we can't post bail? Most of the money is in the family trust.Normally, Julie would have access to it, but since she's charged with k*lling Nan There's gotta be something I can use for collateral? There's not enough that's yours to pledge.There's gotta be something we can do.Well, if she were to assign you power of attorney over the trust, temporarily Well I don't want it to appear as though I'm losing faith in her.Perhaps you can bring it up with her, from a legal standpoint.- Well, that's your call, William.- Yes.Now, as far as a defense attorney, I want the best you can get.She can't tell us what it is or what it isn't, what she should tell us, what she shouldn't.She's a pathological liar.Whatever story works, that's the one she goes with.Whatever works for her.She's not lying to us, she's lying to herself.Are you hoping the truth is in these boxes? We're looking for the evidence Nan had against Kenneth.What makes you think she had anything more than a mother's instinct? Well, her husband said she did her due diligence.Last time, that meant photos of Julie's fiance.The evidence against Julie lays out in a nice, straight line.Juries like straight lines.Whatever Nan had, it's not here.And there's no evidence she hired an investigator now, or three years ago to take photos of Junker.Well, maybe she kept it in-house.So, what's your thinking on this m*rder? They're trying to find out who Mrs.Turner hired to take the snapshots of that What's his name? Junker.And the Captain thinks it was you.Well, you want a job done right, hire a pro.What can I tell you? Legwork 101.So when it was Kenneth's turn, she came to you? You would've thought.I even offered but Mrs.Turner said no.Why do you think? Mrs.Turner didn't want another incident.You mean, with Julie? She was violent? Yeah.She att*cked her mother? Well, they had this huge argument when Mrs.Turner showed her the pictures.I thought it was over.But that night, they're on their way out to go to some dinner, and Julie hauled off and punched her.Nearly broke her jaw.So this time, Mrs.Turner wanted to be more supportive of her daughter.She even took her to Florida the weekend before she d*ed.Just the two of them.Come back happy as pismo clams.I don't think Julie did it.We'll pass that on to the DA.Thanks for coming in.Yeah, one last thing.This punch-out over the photos, did Kenneth know about it? Yeah, he asked me about it once.He found it amusing.Well, you know where to find me.Kenneth told us he didn't think Julie was capable of hurting her mother.Gee, you think he was lying? He knew she could be provoked.With rumors of Nan selling the hotel, with Nan paying off another fiance, he got her to do his dirty work for him.If she gets caught, his hands are clean So much for nice straight lines.I gladly posted bail today.Anyone who knows my daughter, knows she could not possibly have committed this crime.Julie! Julie, did you do it? She has no comment, gentlemen.No comment, please.I just wanna say how much I miss my mom.I loved her very much.Do you have any other comments? It may amuse you to know her lawyer's already putting out feelers for a plea bargain.I'm inclined to accept.Even if someone put her up to it? That doesn't lessen her culpability.Who is this someone? Her fiance.He created a circumstance which he knew in the past had caused her to att*ck her mother.If her fiance were trying to control her, wouldn't she lash out at him? Not if he made her believe Nan was pulling the strings.If you take Julie's plea, if you put the weight of this m*rder on her shoulders alone, we lose our leverage against any other suspect.I'll hold off responding to their plea offer.But sooner or later, I will take the bird in hand.Kenneth, he knew that if he could trick Nan into paying him off, Julie would snap.And the way to trick Nan was to let her find out about his, you know, bad behavior.Nan and Julie spent the weekend in Florida.She wrote the check when she came back.Kenneth was in the city alone.Whatever he did to set Nan off, good chance he did it that weekend.At this point, I don't think we should count on Kenneth.But who else can testify for me? Well, that's why I approached Mr.Carver.About a plea bargain? Absolutely not.Will, consider manslaughter.If Julie said she had help from Well, from Kenneth, for example.I would never hurt Kenneth, ever.My daughter doesn't have to perjure herself to win.If you're afraid to try this case, we'll find someone who isn't.Friday night he had sushi for one.Phone calls to Julie in South Beach every couple of hours.So lovey-dovey.Do you have a charge there CAFE BRASILIA TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3 Did you see who was number two? No.This is Kenny? He's so handsome.Everybody's having a, you know, a good time.This is a good time place.I like these photos.Who took them? Mercedes.You remember this guy three Saturdays ago? Oh, yes.This guy asked me to take a picture of him and his date, like a surprise.So, I do.What did his date look like? They were kissing.I see only the back of his head.He was wearing a baseball hat.His head? The date was a man? / Yes.Did he buy the photo? This guy buy it right away.Okay? Kenneth outed himself.He sent the photo to Nan anonymously.He knew that it would get her to pay him off.Why didn't Nan just tell Julie? She had proof, in living color.No.If she did, Julie would've dumped him herself.Kenneth's plan wouldn't have worked.He had to make Nan appear unreasonable.He had to make absolutely sure that Nan would never show Julie the photo.Julie goes to jail, who's left standing? No.It explains everything.We're both innocent, okay? I told Mr.Behrens I'm not interested in a plea bargain.Neither are we, but we're compelled to explore mitigating circumstances.I'm not some puppet.No one can manipulate me into A: Something I didn't do, and B: Something I would never do.C and D: You att*cked your mother three years ago and Kenneth knew it.That's I was a different person then.- Anyway, Kenneth didn't know.- He knew.He talked to your house detective.This is Mr.Cooper's statement.While you and your mother were in Florida, Kenneth went to a nightclub.This is a photo of his reservation.You see his name here? Kenny.While he was there, he had a photo taken of himself.A compromising photo which he sent to Nan anonymously.This is the statement from the hostess at the club.And this is the statement of the girl who took the photo.Please.Kenneth kissing another man? Believe me, if my mother had that photo, she would've shown it to me.Even if it meant hurting you? I've gotten over worse.Kenneth didn't want you to get over this.And there's a reason why your mother didn't show you the photo.Because she did love you.She was afraid it would destroy you.We found out Kenneth served on a tourism board last year.- Did you know that? - No.Your father was on the same board.Did he mention meeting Ken? No.He was only on it for a few months.What does this have to do with anything? That benefit where you met Kenneth, how did you happen to go? My father bought me a ticket.He thought I should get involved in good works.Your father has your best interest at heart? He gives you good advice? Yes, he does.He's always there for you.He was standing next to you on the courthouse steps./ Yes.He probably asked you not to take the plea bargain.That a trial would vindicate you? Yes, he did.He believes in me.What are you getting at? We noticed, from the trust accounts, your mother paid your father a monthly allowance.I don't know.That was between them.Who signs those allowance checks now? Well, because of this nonsense You signed power of attorney over to your father? If you go to prison, what'll happen to the hotel? - I'm not going to prison.- If you do, who will control the hotel? Your father? Yes.Because he has power of attorney, he could sell it.- He wouldn't.- But he could and there would be no one to stop him.No.No, my father did not do this to me.Don't get upset and just sit and listen.Your father knew your temper.He knew what buttons to push.He used Ken to provoke you.I'm not listening to any more of this! Julie./ Let her go.Go ahead, Julie, run.Just run.You push her one way, she goes the other.Those are the exact words your father said to us.Imagine the insight that he gave Kenneth.No wonder Ken understood you.Oh, this can't be true.My father loves me.Your mother loved you.She didn't show you the photo, she couldn't show you the photo, because the other man kissing Ken wasn't just any other man.No.No, my My father's not gay.This is a monstrous lie.Julie, come on, you've known it all along.Even as a kid, this image that your parents presented to you, of a happy marriage, and what you saw with your eyes was out of sync with what you felt.Oh, God.What's happening? What's happening to me? Look, in my own life, I know what it's like to have your judgment, your sense of security, undermined by your parents.Because they were hiding a truth or denying it to themselves.You can survive that.My client's ready to admit her guilt in her mother's m*rder, but obviously, her father's involvement has changed her situation.As I said, we're willing to consider mitigation.But we still have to make a case against Mr.Turner.Do you have a plan? We've discussed one.We found a clause in your mother's trust agreement.You need my help? Well, only if you're up to it.Julie! Julie, if I'd known you were waiting for me, I would've come home sooner.How are you, honey? I have news, Daddy.Good news.Great.Would you like a drink? No.I'm going back on the wagon.Well, now that is great news.How'd it go with the district attorney? Have they come to their senses yet? Not yet, but Daddy, the good news.There's a miracle.After the meeting, I went to the doctor's.I'm pregnant.Does anyone else know this? I just talked to Kenneth.Daddy, he was so happy, he cried.- And then we decided - Decided what? In the morning, we're going to City Hall to get married.Oh, no.Oh, no.You can't rush this.You've got a trial.Kenneth doesn't want to wait.I'm sure he doesn't.Julie, did you ever show the family trust papers to Kenneth? Maybe once, why? That's it, reel him in.Because there's a clause in the trust that says that, if in any case that you can't administer the trust, say you d*ed, or went to prison, it would pass to your child, or your child's guardian.That will be Kenneth if you marry him.Well, I'm sure Kenneth would take good care of things.No, no, no, no.Kenneth is not the kind of man you think he is.What do you mean? I thought you liked him.I do.But you can't marry him.I swore to your mother I would never tell you this.She was convinced you wouldn't be able to handle it.Handle what? Your mother received a photograph of Kenneth in a compromising situation.He's the father of my child now.I think I can forgive him an indiscretion.Not this one.He was with another man.Got him.Daddy, why didn't you tell me? You seemed so happy.You'd let me live a lie? - I thought that - Whoa, whoa, where's she going? if you found out about his preference later, - Where's she going? - you'd learn to live with it.Is that what mother did? Learn to live with it? What are you talking about? No.No.We gotta get in there.We gotta get in there! You never had anything for me.Ever.You never loved me.Mom did, but you didn't.Julie.You bastard! How could you do this to me? Our whole life was a lie! I was just a child.Mom loved me! Hey, if anyone deserved it - She wasn't ready.- Detective No, no, no, I know that anger.I should've seen it coming.
02x13 - See MeQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:22In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.How long was Mr.Richter your patient? A little over 10 years.It's imperative that I get in touch with him.This new information directly impacts his condition.This new information you can't tell me about.You never did say what your specialty was.I'm a psychiatrist.And how did you find out Mr.Richter was my patient? Did you snoop through confidential records? - Dr.Dysart - Dr.Roland, I think Mr.Richter probably had good reason to stop seeing you.I need to see him, Mr.Garcia.I am his doctor.He's never mentioned you.Why don't we ask him? Is he here? Derek, this man needs to go.All right, all right, all right, all right.Can I leave him a note? Jeff.Jeff.It's me, Michael.Hey, did you get my note? I don't want to talk to you.Do you still like steak? There's a place right over on Lexington Listen, you just stay away.I faxed that note to Katherine B.Thompson.She's at the New York Times.You can tell me all about it right over Don't touch me.Don't ever touch me! Jeff.If he ever touches me again, I'll k*ll him.Come on, man, let's go back Inside.Say goodbye to Grandma.I can't believe she's gone.It's just me now.You have us.You have Matthew.Come on, Maisy, one bush is as good as the next.Tough doggie.Finally.Law & Order CI No wallet, no ID in the pocket.You checked the dog tags? Oh, right.I'm waiting on that.Major Case catching muggings now, huh? Only the ones in the Mayor's backyard.We're ready for that witness.I count 11 Kn*fe wounds to the chest, shoulders, neck.None on the hands or arms.No defensive wounds.He's got Kn*fe strikes coming at him from all sides.He would have put his arms up to protect himself.And look at the way he's tangled up in these vines.I don't know.This guy was disoriented.Maybe because somebody was trying to k*ll him.Yeah, but he didn't do the things that might have saved him.You found the body? Yeah, I was jogging.His dog jumped out of the bushes.You ever seen him? Yeah, just before I decided to turn around and go home, around 10:00.Is there a particular reason why you turned around and went home? Lightning.Dry lightning.I caught a flash out of the corner of my eye.Right.Okay, thanks.I got an address for Maisy's owner.- Dr.Michael Roland, over on York.- Thanks.Dry lightning? In the park? Behind Gracie Mansion? Is that where he usually walks your dog? Yes.It's just so close.Oh, my God, Michael.We're very sorry.He ever mention any problems with his psychiatric patients, any threats? No.What did you think when your husband didn't come home? I didn't know what to think.Did you think that he wasn't walking the dog? He'd been out of the office a lot, in the mornings, or in the middle of the afternoon.He always had an excuse.People have been coming over, bringing food.Yes.My mother passed away.The service was two days ago.Well, that must've been very stressful for you and your husband.Yes.Yes, it was.OFFICE OF DR.MICHAEL ROLAND WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4 I don't know what problems Dr.Roland was having at home, but I can guarantee he was not having an affair.I'm not opening these files.And I'm not giving you the password for his computer.Dr.Roland would want his patients' privacy protected.Even if one of his patients tried to k*ll him? His patients are neurotic, not psychotic.You logged on to his computer this morning, after we called you.- I did not.- Says right here you did.See, I can't open his folders, but I can get a record of when somebody last logged on.So you, what? You tried to erase his stash of dirty little pictures? - Compromising e-mails? - Absolutely not.Maybe she erased her own naughty things.Were you having a You know, fooling around with Dr.Roland? I didn't erase anything.His lawyer told me to save everything till he could look at it.There.That e-mail from Dr.Roland's internet server."To user M.Roland, the New York Attorney General's office has notified us" "of your unauthorized attempts to access NYMEDD." That's the Medicaid database.He was trying to hack into it? Medicaid said Roland was looking for the records of somebody named Jeff Richter.- Roland's secretary's never heard of him.- Have we? There's a Jeff Richter with the same social security number Roland used for his search.He's got a three-year-old as*ault charge.Bring him in.Easier said.His last known's no good.BCI doesn't have them.Neither does the DMV, Con Ed Look what he gives as his occupation when he was booked."De-programmed CIA assassin." This guy's got problems.He doesn't want to be found.Probably resents people who try.Well, he'd better get over it.Put an APB out to the homeless shelters.Right.Okay, all right, thank you.The weather service says no reports of lightning last night.When did Roland hack the Medicaid database? About three months ago.It's right after his mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer.Derek saw him just before 9:00.He was going up to his room.Nobody saw him after that.They say the doctor was stabbed 11 times.He can do that.You know he can do that.I know.We have to protect ourselves.Derek and me will take care of it.Don't worry.Work will go on.Cinderblock.I know Cinderblock rooms.How many floors underground are we? We're 11 floors up, Jeff.Didn't you see the buttons on the elevator? Up is down.Down is up.I know the tricks.- You're him.He's you.- And who's he? I don't know him.You don't know Michael Roland, your own brother-in-law? Oh, I know that guy.But that's a facsimile of that guy.North Koreans have been turning out facsimiles for years.When's the last time you saw this facsimile? Last week at the Garcia House.He gave me a note about a funeral.Your mother's funeral.The whole thing was a trap.You lived at the Garcia House on 117th? Yeah, before the facsimile blew my cover.They asked me to leave so innocent people wouldn't be hurt.That's the price you pay when you work for the CIA.You were still at Garcia House Thursday night? Yes.I ate spaghetti.I had a smoke on the stoop and I went to bed.Anybody see you on that stoop? Millions of people.It's a big city.No, I see what you're doing, Jeff.You're using backward logic.Like, only sick people take pills, so if I stop taking pills, I I won't be sick.You follow? I take my pills.Yes.You didn't have anything on you when they picked you up at the shelter.And we looked up your Medicaid account.No charges in over a year.That's a lie.I take my pills.See for yourself.You know, I know it's hard to stay on your meds.It's like your head is, you know, wrapped in a wet blanket.But if you go off, then, well, that's when the trouble starts.Most schizophrenics aren't violent.But sometimes you are.That's why they asked you to leave Garcia House? It was to protect the innocent.From you.Because you were starting fights.I was not.I take my meds.Geodon.I take Geodon.Come on, Jeff.You even got into a fight Thursday night.You went for a walk.I don't go out nights.You ran into Michael and his dog.I tell you, I don't go out at night.It's too dark.I don't like it.I like your socks.Where'd you get them? The mission.Lucky you found a matching pair.Yeah.He squints.He doesn't like going out at night.He can't distinguish shades.He's got nyctalopia, night blindness.He wouldn't have att*cked Roland at night, he would've waited for daytime.Maybe under normal circumstances, but this guy hasn't taken his meds in over a year.Well, that's another thing.Geodon only came out on the market last year.The only way he'd know about it is if he was taking it.His fairy godmother must be paying for it because there's no record Medicaid is.There's no record of Richter anywhere this past year.He took himself off the radar.More than likely someone else did.My bet, it wasn't the North Koreans.Richter applied for a new social security number last year.He said he was being stalked.That's his supporting documentation.Five pages, typed, single spaced.I think he had help.Medicaid ran his new social security number.Besides his meds, they pay for his chiropractor twice a week, his dentist, once a week, eye doctor, art therapy, podiatrist, dermatologist.That guy's sicker than he looks.Let's find out.Jeff, how you feeling? Pretty good.How's your sciatica? Medicaid says you see a chiropractor for sciatica nerve problems in your left leg.Oh, that's all better.Your feet? Says here you see a podiatrist.I have bad arches.Can we see your feet? These dogs don't look so bad.What else does your doctor do besides clean your feet? Nothing.My arches still hurt.I told Mr.Garcia.Still, you have to admit, my feet look pretty good.They should, at 500 bucks a visit.GARCIA HOUSE HOMELESS SHELTER FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6 I had a chat with that doctor.Our medical advisory board said his fees and methods were pretty standard.This is your advisory board here? And lots of heavy hitters.How's Jeff? We've been so worried about him since he ran away.He told us he was asked to leave.We don't turn anybody away.When we bring people in off the street, we make them a promise, they'll always have a home.And you served spaghetti for dinner Thursday night? That sounds right.And after dinner Jeff likes to have a smoke on the stoop.I kind of lost track of Jeff that night.We don't do bed checks, so all I can say is, I don't I didn't see him.And what about you, Mrs.Garcia? I was upstairs in our rooms.All right.Well, so, maybe Jeff was here, you know, maybe he wasn't.Did he do any of these? No.Our other residents.We take them to art therapy twice a week.Oh.Emily LeCroix, what was she diagnosed with? Schizophrenia.- Really? - Yes.It's a wonderful painting, so full of hope.Well, it certainly is, um, you know, full of something.That's my favorite.Carol James.- Let me guess.- The lady has bipolar disorder.My mother's roommate at Carmel Ridge, she's bipolar.She paints fruit, too.But, you know, bright blue apples, hot pink bananas.Her paintings are raw.They're filled with energy.She's, she's driven to express herself.I didn't see any of that in that painting.And the kids on the beach? Well, schizophrenics are Well, they typically focus on the eyes.Would have been the children's eyes, the dog's.No, I think the Garcias probably bought those paintings at a garage sale.The Garcias charged Medicaid 200 bucks a week for Jeff's art therapy classes.Plus 50 bucks transportation.You feel like sticking around for their next field trip? They drove around for half an hour and then went back to Garcia House.Well, they let one of them out.He had to go to the bathroom, so they let him take a pee off the pier.Off the pier? That's compassion.Compassion has its rewards.At 50 bucks a head, the Garcias can charge Medicaid 800 bucks for transportation.If there is fraud and Dr.Roland found out Well, the Garcias could have had one of their counselors take care of him.If fraud there is.What do you call Jeff Richter's $500 pedicures? The art classes he doesn't remember attending? That's your star witness, Jeff Richter, the one-time m*rder suspect? You'd use him to impugn the characters of two advocates of the homeless who've earned the respect of the people of this city? We've seen their press clippings.Good.I won't go near a grand jury if your only evidence is the ramblings of a lone, deranged individual.How about the ramblings of 10 deranged individuals? What the hell did you get me into? You lumped me in with those quacks.I'm just saying, Doc, everybody's got to get their stories straight.My patients need to continue their treatment.Which brings me to my last point, your last state check should have come in.You need to settle up.How much do you want? What the hell are you doing? I can't take a personal check.A money order, Doc, same as always.I have a patient waiting.TOMPKINS SQUARE MONDAY, DECEMBER 9 You're Emily LeCroix.I saw your painting at the Garcia House, the kids on the beach with the dog.No, I didn't do that.Well, Mrs.Garcia said you painted that at your art therapy class.No.I don't like dogs at all.Do you take art therapy classes? Oh, yes.I went last Saturday.What do you do in these classes? We painted an office.You mean you painted a mural on a wall? Well, sure, we painted the walls.We painted them white.But Mr.Garcia said that's what his friend wanted, white walls.Is that what they have you do in these classes, paint walls? And ceilings.It's very therapeutic.Thanks, Emily.Let's hear what the others have to say.This is Mr.Biagiotti.Tell them where they take you every week for drama therapy.Downtown to watch a show.Tell them what kind of show.You know, a TV show.Care to know how much the Garcias charge Medicaid for this drama therapy? I can only guess.Mr.Biagiotti told me the Garcias had him change his social security number.You'll have warrants by the end of the day.I don't care what this says.You can't come in like this.Our residents / That's why we brought the Department of Health with us.- Is Mrs.Garcia upstairs? - What do you want with my wife? We have an arrest warrant for her.We have one for you, too.What is this? Mrs.Garcia, you're under arrest.Put your hands behind your back.Why are you doing this to me? I am Lupe Garcia.This is an injustice.If I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes Well, human misery pays well.Mr.And Mrs.Garcia did not go out last Thursday night.That's for a fact.You're very sure of this fact.Mr.Garcia was in this office from 8:10 to 10:27.Lupe went upstairs at 9:14.What about Derek and the other counselors? Derek Ortiz, certified in special needs care, punched out at 10:15.Something wrong with your eyes, Reggie? I had a recent intraocular scraping.Cataracts? Yes.You take Geodon? Mmm-hmm.By prescription only.For my schizophrenia.Okay, Reggie, thanks.Okay.Well, that makes 15.Fifteen residents with eye problems.Jeff Richter, Mr.Biagiotti from the park, Reggie All of them schizophrenics.I've just been upstairs.Tell me I was imagining things.The faucets really are gold plated.It's disillusioning, to say the least.On the bright side, everybody on staff is accounted for the night Dr.Roland was k*lled.The Garcias might be thieves but they aren't murderers.The doctors the Garcias used in their scheme, they switched them up every six months or so, except for the eye doctors.They've used the same one for the last three years.A Dr.Thomas Dysart.Maybe he was actually treating these people.Well, they don't seem better off for it.When Dr.Roland hacked into Jeff Richter's Medicaid files, did we find out how far he got? OFFICE OF DR.THOMAS DYSART TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10 Jeff Richter? Yes, he is a patient.But I'd have to look up his file.We have his Medicaid file right here.This $3,500 charge last September, what's this code mean? That's for cataract surgery.Cataract surgery? Isn't that the same code as this procedure here, back in June? Two cataract surgeries in one year? One for each eye.I told her you'd have a logical explanation for that.Now, are you a fan, or are these up here to convince your patients they have eye problems? I put them up to invite ridiculous questions.Now, I have a patient in five minutes.There's a charge here for another surgery in March.Which eye was that for, Doctor? That's for a pre-op exam.You people don't know how lucky you are not having to deal with Medicaid.They assign a set fee for a procedure which has nothing to do with the actual cost.You're saying you overcharge Medicaid? No.My billing service sends them an invoice with all the bells and whistles.They lowball me.We negotiate.And I eventually get paid a fair price.I told her there was a logical explanation for that, too.And that's the reason why there are multiple surgery charges for your patients at Garcia House.Garcia House? Yes.The homeless are particularly susceptible to eye problems because of diet, hygiene, drug use But I really don't have to justify my work to you.Well, you just did.You know, speaking for myself, I'm satisfied.That's an $8,000 piece of equipment Detective.Don't play with it.I've always wondered what this was.It's a transilluminator, to check pupillary reflex.Was Dr.Roland satisfied with your explanation? Roland? Never heard of him.Jeff Richter was his brother-in-law.Dr.Roland was looking for him.Roland tried to hack into Jeff's medical files.He managed to download the charges for the eye treatments before he got booted off.Sorry.Never talked to him.What goes in there? Nothing.We bought this at a medical supply store.It's called a glare tester.That's what was missing from Dysart's office.It gives off a bright light to test the retina's response.And Dysart used this to blind Dr.Roland? That's why Roland couldn't defend himself.Now, this jogger confused this bright light with dry lightning.And Dysart probably damaged his in the att*ck, so he had to get rid of it.That's the "how." I don't quite see the "why." Even if Dr.Roland discovered he was defrauding Medicaid By performing cataract surgeries.Isn't that as*ault? First degree, no less, being in furtherance of a felony Dysart knew he was facing serious prison time.What actual evidence do you have to tie him to the m*rder? He lives alone, no one saw him coming or going.We could canvass the park again.In the meantime, we'll build an as*ault and fraud case, have our own doctors examine his patients, and talk to his billing service.Tom, I'm your malpractice attorney.This is beyond my field of I hate when you equivocate, Norman.You will most certainly be charged as an accomplice to the Garcias.But it gets worse, since you performed surgery on these people.I'm not guilty, Norman.Of course not.But you're open to as*ault charges, unless you can demonstrate that the procedures are medically legitimate.They are! The patients are undergoing a legitimate course of treatment./ Results.You have to prove it with results.Beneficial results.You mean, someone who's completed the treatment.Yes.A success story.Can you do that? Dr.Dysart sent us the worksheets with the procedures checked off.I had no way of telling if he actually performed those procedures.She's not trained to do medical oversight.She's just a bookkeeper.Dysart gave us a cock and bull story about Medicaid lowballing his fees.No, he's right.When I took over his billing, I noticed he was being shortchanged on his fees.It was your idea to inflate the charges to Medicaid? It's standard practice to negotiate for every nickel.Dr.Dysart must have been thrilled you came up with this idea.I don't think he cared.Getting paid wasn't a priority.He was always late getting his worksheets to me.He was probably too busy moving patients in and out of his office.I'd be surprised if he saw more than My other eye doctors, they see that many patients in an hour.You gotta hear this.Dr.Emerson was just giving us his report on Dysart's Garcia House patients.Go ahead, Doctor.I examined the 15 residents Dysart operated on.These individuals were subjected to repeated and needless retinal, corneal, and cataract surgeries for a period of over two years.Some had as many as 18 procedures during that time.With what results? Five have permanently detached retinas, others have diminished vision, oversensitivity to light, night blindness.They all have surgical scars on top of surgical scars.They got laser cuts going nowhere.Dysart said these people had unique eye problems because they'd been homeless.I don't care if these people were living on Mars.In my experience, there is no medical justification for this this butchery.You made your point, Doctor.Thank you.Where are we on the m*rder? We canvassed the park, we showed his photo around, we fanned on every pitch.But we still have him on fraud and for assaulting these poor bastards.He could simply claim incompetence and hide behind his malpractice insurance.We need proof he intended to defraud.You're talking about making a deal with the Garcias.Not a generous deal, but a deal.If it gets us Dysart.Greedy son of a bitch.It's worse than that.I don't think he did it for money.These are the doctors' statements about the kickbacks to the Garcias.This is from a livery service whose offices were painted by the residents of the Garcia House under the guides of art therapy.And this is from the staff about field trips to parking lots.You have your statements, we have ours.From mental health advocates, civic leaders, all testifying to the fact that hundreds of mentally disabled persons have been helped by the Garcias.There are words and then there are pictures.This is the work of your ophthalmologist, Dr.Dysart.You see this? You see that? That's Emily LeCroix's left eye, post-op.That scar tissue is from three operations in less than six months.Thanks to Dr.Dysart, she's legally blind in that eye.This is Jeff Richter's eye.Dysart didn't wait for his scars to heal from one operation before operating on him again.So now he needs corneal transplants.Dios.We didn't know that he was doing this.Mrs.Garcia, wait.- What do you want from my clients? - Dysart.You help us prosecute him, I'll consider a plea.First, I hear what they have to say.He was just supposed to examine them.I told him not to hurt them.Where'd you find Dysart? He came to me at a mental health benefit.He'd heard about our work with schizophrenics and offered his services.He specifically mentioned schizophrenics? Yeah.He asked me how many diagnosed schizophrenics were living at the house.Did he say why he was interested? No.He just wanted to work with us, any way he could.If you want their testimony against Dysart, you'll reduce the charges to misdemeanor larceny, they'll pay a fine, they'll retain their license to operate Garcia House.I can't accept their terms.Dysart's a sadist with a medical license.Looks to me he's the greater of two evils.I want to put them all behind bars.That means making a case against Dysart without the Garcias' help.Everything his bookkeeper tells us demonstrates Dysart's indifferent to money.He's in it for the joy of healing? I'm not sure.He targets schizophrenics.Because they're easy prey.So is any mentally ill person.But schizophrenics, more than any other group, are more prone to visual hallucinations.You're not suggesting that this was an experiment? You eliminate greed and sadism, what's left? Experimental surgery without informed consent, without supervision, That's good for a trip up the river.Get me the evidence.Well, you don't do research without a theory to back it up.He might've published a paper in a medical journal or talked it up with a colleague.OFFICE OF DR.ROYCE PETERSON NYU CANCER CENTER THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12 I haven't spoken to Tom since Columbia, I wouldn't know about his research.You might try someone who's more current.We couldn't find anybody.We only came to you because he used you as a reference when he applied to the Ophthalmological Association.Ophthalmology? You sure? That wasn't his specialty when you knew him? No.It was oncology, same as me.- He lose interest? - I have no idea.We had one year left.I spent the summer in Boston.When I came back, he was gone.They said he took a sabbatical.What did he say? I never talked to him.I didn't even know where he was.Then, a year later, he got in touch with me.Let me guess.He was in Amsterdam.This is from the Van Gogh Museum.It's on the back.He sent me that as a graduation gift.Never heard from him again.And he never expressed an interest in ophthalmology? / No.Maybe when he was smoking that legal weed in Amsterdam, he figured out eye doctors have a better chance of getting laid than oncologists.I don't think he was in Amsterdam for the weed.Look up for me, please.Good.Now look to the left.Okay.Dr.Dysart, I'm not sure I understood you on the phone.Marilyn's going into the next phase of her treatment.It's all covered by her Medicaid.Are you still on Zyprexa, Marilyn? My eyes are okay, Dr.Dysart.It's been two years since she's had any blurriness.It's a multiphase treatment.If we stop now, she'll never get better.I assume you want Marilyn to get better, don't you? Columbia just faxed Dysart's records.When he came back from his year off, he doubled his workload to complete his requirements for ophthalmology.Finished in the top percentile.He spent most of his sabbatical in Amsterdam.He gave Columbia an address at a hotel there.On Paulus Potterstraat.That's the same street as the Van Gogh Museum.Maybe Dysart was thinking of becoming a reconstructive surgeon.The story is, Van Gogh gave his ear to a prost*tute as, you know, a token of love.But who knows, what he was, you know, really thinking.All right, Marilyn, you've been through this before.I'm going to lower the chair.Is my mother still here? She's just outside.This is a local anesthetic.You've had this before.Nothing to be worried about.Put the needle down, Doctor.What? Get out of here.I'm with a patient! You're under arrest, Dr.Dysart.What the hell do you think you're doing? I'd ask you the same thing, but the answer would probably make my hair stand on end.It's unheard of.Arresting a doctor in the middle of a surgery? Or as we call it, during the commission of a crime.Every procedure he performs is guided by sound medical practice.Well, maybe he can explain which sound medical practice guided him during these procedures.This laser incision here, our experts couldn't figure out what it was for.- Was it a mistake, a slip - I don't make My client hardly has to explain himself to a couple of laymen.Either two laymen now or 12 later.Our experts were also mystified by the multiple operations to Miss LeCroix's left eye, while it seems you hardly touched her right.Did Medicaid only cover the left? There is no medical explanation, is there? His practice is exactly what it looks like, a state-funded eyeball chop shop.He's not going to respond.If you're just going to engage in character assassination There's no character there.There's just this greedy, grasping charnel house butcher who's targeted schizophrenics because nobody would believe them if they complained.Nobody would believe that a doctor would deliberately mutilate their eyes to make a buck.That is not true.I am not a butcher.I was treating them.This cut was made to relax the upper zonules.Tom / And this.Her presbyopia required me to scrape the lens before a cortical cataract formed.You're losing me.You have to show us.Show us how you helped these people.The eye through the eye.The brain interprets what the eye captures.But these people, Doctor, these schizophrenics Schizophrenia, specifically the visual hallucinations, occur when the sensory intake, the information is corrupted.Corrupted.You mean, by the eye? No.By the lens, here.Corrupt information hits the posterior subcapsular cataract - back here, which blocks - The optic nerve.Yes, which leads to the brain.What I do is remove the tainted part of the lens by performing an extracapsular cataract extraction to clean the lens.So, a clean lens lets more light into the optic nerve? Yes.More light stimulates the retina which clears up the hallucinations.You've actually succeeded? Not yet.I was in the final phase of treatment on Marilyn Reese when you interrupted me.All right, so, you get rid of the hallucinations and you get rid of the schizophrenia.Is that the idea? Yes.The patient is free of the disease.Only sick people take pills.If I stop taking my pills, I won't be sick anymore.Well, this is Well, it's revolutionary.When did you discover this treatment? My last year at Columbia.Right after your sabbatical.Which is when you switched specialties.Yes.How did you know Well, I have an interest in your career.Why did you take the sabbatical? I was exhausted.I needed to clear my head, reorder my priorities.So you went to Amsterdam.Is that where you developed an interest in Van Gogh? I'd always been attracted to his work.But it was in Amsterdam where his work, well, acquired a special meaning for you.I mean, as it does many people whose lives are touched with schizophrenia, which means split mind, which is really misleading because the mind isn't split, it's just out of its owner's control That isn't accurate either.It's simply responding to corrupted stimuli.Real physical abnormalities in the sensory organs./ Yes.You talking about this? Most people think he cut it off for love.But some people say he cut it off to stop the auditory hallucinations from driving him crazy.Isn't that where you got the idea? That the disease isn't in the brain, it's in the eyes, the ears, the fingertips.But the brain is Your brain is healthy.It's inconceivable that this instrument that took you to the top of your class at Columbia could ever betray you.It's intolerable.How old were you, Doctor? - My mother was 32 - There's nothing wrong with me.No.Nothing wrong.Yes, you have schizophrenia.That's That's of no consequence.My methods are sound.You had a crisis.You kept it a secret while you applied your wounded intellect to the problem.And this is what you came up with.And this.No! No! No! I am fully in control of myself.What you're afraid of, right, people are going to find out, pump you full of dr*gs, - institutionalize you.- There'd be no need.You must have been terrified when Roland showed up at your office.Terrified that this psychiatrist would see through your professional demeanor.He was there under false pretenses.He was conspiring to put you out of business./ They don't understand.Your cure can make people with your condition masters of their own fate.Yes.No more dr*gs, no more stigma.Yes.No more fear and shame.No, you had to save yourself.You had to stop Roland.Yes.You had to k*ll him.Yes.Oh, no.Now, I have to get back to my work.Yeah.I need to get back to my work.Please let me get back to my work.We agreed to a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease.Dr. Dysart agreed to be institutionalized until our experts decide he's no longer a danger to society.He must be insane.He's the only one who wasn't in it for the money.- Where's Detective Goren? - On the phone.Don't ask.
02x14 - ProbabilityQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:22In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.I quit years ago.Watching my old man die of lung cancer cured me.I'll see what shows up on the blood tests.Thank you, Mr.Gergis.I did okay, huh? Sure.You remember, you call me every couple of weeks.You let me know how you're doing.Not here.Wait till you get outside.Tell Elaine it's for her.Leo, where did you get this? I earned it from medical research.They took my blood.Hey, they paid me $1000.Ben, I got my ring out of hock.Hey, tell Elaine all I want is a chance, huh? I gotta tap a kidney.You wait for me? What are you doing here? I wanted to see you, Ricky.I don't have your number.It's a nice cologne, Dad.Look, if you're looking for money No, no, Ricky, no.Here.It's not much.I'm gonna make things up to you.Okay, look, catch up with your friends, treat them to a slice, and get yourself a CD or something.Another chance with $300? Do you know that he showed up at Rick's campus today? What happens if he decides to visit Emmy at her school? He's my brother.I'll tell him to back off.You tell him that if he comes near the kids again, I'm gonna have him thrown in jail.What should I do? I wanna come home, Ben.I wanna take care of her.Well, you got nothing to offer, Leo.Why don't you hit up those researchers? Well, if they can afford one grand, they can afford 10, it's I'll see you around, Leo.Oh, hi.I thought I got the address wrong.Sorry I had to bother you.Hey, well, that makes two of us, buddy.Law & Order CI Morning shift found him crushed in here.He tried to slip through and then the gate opened.Well, didn't anyone hear him scream? The gate's pretty loud.Hey, one of you guys got the time? They heard you just fine.Maybe, they didn't hear him scream because he didn't scream, 'cause he was already dead.Latent ID'd him as Leo Gergis, 48.He has a record of panhandling and vagrancy.There's a preliminary finding of accidental death.The gate caught him on the right side of the head, but most of the trauma is on the left.Look at this.St.Victor's.The homeless shelter in Brooklyn.It's a long way from Hunts Point.He was married.There's There's no tan line on his finger.Maybe he just started wearing it.The gold is tarnished.There's a thin line across the band.Someone tied a string around it.Maybe a pawnbroker's tag.Somehow he had the money to get it out of hock.You know, when you live in a shelter, you learn not to hide things in your socks, your pockets, your pants.You know, I've always wanted a jacket like that.Well, maybe we can find out where Leo got his.How did it happen? We're not sure.Had you seen him recently? No, no, well, not since he crashed my son's high school graduation.When they found him, he was wearing this.Do you recognize it? Yeah.He was wearing this? Did he have any reason to think you were getting back together? No, I didn't give him any.How about you, Mr.Gergis? Did your brother say anything to you? Well, a couple of weeks ago, he gave me $300 for Elaine, and he gave my nephew $100.He thought he could buy his way back into the family.We found another $500 on him.You have any idea where he got that money? He said something about giving blood.Well, you don't make that kind of money selling blood.Well, then I don't know! He Maybe he had some scam going.He used to be marketing director for a cruise line.He He was no idiot.He couldn't take care of his family, but he damn well took care of his own needs.We hold their stuff for three months and then it goes to Goodwill.Here's Leo's stuff.Oh, sorry.Here.Oh, no, that's okay.I'm better without.Leo knew his mustard.These look like they're from a hotel.Well, he bought these.Tax stamps are still on them.Maybe he bought them for a friend.I mean, there was no nicotine on Leo's fingers or his teeth.He doesn't smoke.Leo's buddies, any of them smoke this brand? Filtered, yeah.There's Johnny, Johnny Dikins.I haven't seen him here in a month.He left his stuff behind.John Dikins, age 45.DOA a month ago.Finding of accidental death.Next time, call first.I'm supposed to be on my lunch break.You get a lunch break? All right, he fell through the floor of an abandoned building.Autopsy found blunt force trauma to the second and third vertebrae.Broken neck.Do it to you every time.Apparently, so does being homeless.Two deaths by blunt force trauma consistent with freak accident.Yeah, and two victims in their late 40s, both in good health.How many cases with this profile in the last 12 months, in all five boroughs, men and women? Here's another.Death from accidental overdose, pass.Death from exposure, pass.Here we go.Lisa Fitterman, female, Caucasian, slip and fall down the stairs at 59th Street station.Head injuries, 46-year-old vagrant.That's 14.Right.Yeah.Fourteen homeless people.Male, female, all Caucasian, all between the ages of 45 and 55.All in, you know, reasonably good health.All of them dead from injuries that include a massive blow to the head.Someone's k*lling the great bums of New York.There's a call on your direct line.He said it's about a client, someone named Leo.Jack Bernard.How can I help you? I'm not sure I can do that.I have associates.I'll talk to them.I No, you give me a number.I Just Hello? I'll be back in 10.Nothing's jumping out.The deaths were already factored into the Compstat mortality report.If there was a pattern, the computer would've picked it up.Well, maybe not.These deaths are scattered across precincts.Sometimes two weeks apart, sometimes two months.Different times, different days of the week.I don't see a motive here.If it's random, maybe it's because it is random.If these were random, the law of averages says there'd be coincidences with the times or the locations.The fact there are no coincidences means somebody's working very hard at not setting off alarm bells.Leo is your freshest trail.Start with him.In the works.We're tracking the lot numbers on the mustard jars in his knapsack.Sophia, these detectives wanna talk to you about the needle you found in Mr.Gergis' trash.It was very small, with a little rubber tube on it.Sounds like the kind used to take blood samples.Did you find anything else in the trash? There was these sticky square things and little strips of paper.Electrocardiogram.Leo had a physical.Now why would somebody get a physical in a hotel room? Now, we ran all 14 victims through the insurance Medical Information Bureau.They were all insured for a million bucks under "keyman" policies.The Atlantic Union Insurance Company, they thought that they were insuring the vice president of finances for Compagnie Fiduciaire Elysee of France.Trans-State Insurance thinks Johnny was the director of marketing for Compagnie lmmobiliere Concorde in Paris.Somebody passed them off as corporate honchos.Working for French companies that are the beneficiaries of the policies.Let me guess.The companies were bogus.Yeah, someone is recruiting these people, cleaning them up, and getting them a checkup.And then when the policy is enforced, they k*ll them to look like an accident.At a million bucks a pop, why didn't the insurers notice a trend? Well, the scheme was designed to avoid detection by using different underwriters and actuaries, submitting policies under brokers' names without their knowledge.Yeah, I wonder how many homeless are walking around with a price on their head.Find out while you can still do something about it.This perp must have left tracks.We don't know enough about insurance companies, so they're sending us an expert.You play the piano, Mr.Stevens? Your fingers I taught myself.Moving my fingers like this relaxes me.Your work makes you tense? It stimulates me, looking for fraud, looking for falsehoods.They always betray themselves.The man you're looking for got his training at Hartford State.You figured that out just by glancing at this material? So he learned something at Hartford State that he used to commit the crimes.Maybe he took classes in statistics.Colonial New England sponsors a course in actuarial studies at Hartford State.The instructor uses an idiosyncratic approach to probability analysis.Your man used that approach to manipulate the variables of each crime to avoid detection.These four, what's the common thread? Well, he's familiar with industrial insurance.These cases, Dikins and Sher, displayed proprietary knowledge specific to two insurers, Ohio Mutual and National Colonial.Our man worked for one of them.Or it's a coincidence.Well, no such thing.No.The more intricate the apparent pattern, the simpler the underlying reality.Chaos Theory.What else can you see? He did a stint with an international firm.Because he knew how to file incorporation papers for the phony French companies.Yes.This is really great.That completes his skill set.Other than that, I can't help you.Thank you, Mr.Stevens.I didn't know you had an older, geekier brother.How was your flight? Turbulent.Everything connected with this business is turbulent.It's dishwater.Will you tell me why you need this? We're not involved in each other's private business anymore.You made the rules, remember? This guy worked for Ohio Mutual from '88 to '93.Specialized in employee benefits.He interned at Lloyd's of London in the '70s.Now, that's two markers.That's it.Two out of five markers.Maybe there are no perfect matches.Maybe there are two people who together have the required skill set.Maybe I'm starting to sound like your little buddy.There is one marker that Wally Stevens forgot.That not only did our guy recruit homeless people, he had to find them again when it was time to k*ll them.Now, that wouldn't be easy unless you worked with the homeless.Insurance guys love to give each other awards, especially for their humanitarian work.Their trade association newsletter might have something about it.The Dominion Award for Civic Action.Looks like there are three people in the last 10 years who won for their work with the homeless.This guy looks old enough to be Wally's grandfather.But this guy, he looks in good shape.He might know his way around a blunt instrument.Jack Bernard.Now, he sounds familiar.He got the award five years ago, "For tireless efforts on behalf of the homeless." Back then, he worked for National Colonial.That's one of the companies Wally mentioned.That's two markers.Three.He grew up in Hartford, went to Hartford State.He's gonna wish he stayed.Mr.Bernard, it's the police.There's a light on around back.Gas.There's somebody on the floor in there.He's dead.According to his passport, he hasn't been out of the country in three years.I don't see how he picked up those insurance checks in Paris.Yeah, this room doesn't fit.He's got this expensive furniture and then these cheap posters on the wall.I mean, look at this stereo.What's that worth? Maybe $150.And then this dining room set is worth about $10,000.Maybe he has a friend in the furniture business.Well, all this stuff is from Faubourg Saint-Louis showroom.Maybe his friend in the furniture business is French.I haven't worked for that furniture company in two years.Why are you bothering me with this ancient history? You were personnel director until they fired you.I was not fired.No, see, the company said they fired you two years ago for taking kickbacks from an insurance broker, Jack Bernard.All these ridiculous accusations.Have you ever heard of the Compagnie Fiduciaire Elysee? No, must be your pronunciation.Yeah, it must be, because the Interpol found your fingerprints on incorporation papers from that company.Your client and Mr.Bernard took their initial scam and kicked it up a couple notches.They insured homeless people as key executives of bogus French companies and then they k*lled them for the insurance money.My client denies any complicity in this scheme.But she may know of other victims that Mr.Bernard has insured and is planning on k*lling in the future.How many? Un? Deux? Trois? Deux.Well, we certainly don't want Mr.Bernard k*lling any more people.Let's hear her story.Off the record.I didn't know Jack was going to k*ll anyone, okay? He didn't explain it to me until after the first person d*ed, and then I was afraid.I had to go along.Yeah, I can imagine.It's true.He picked the victims.He decided when to k*ll them.And what, you just held his coat? I just set up the companies.I collected the checks, and I kept the policies in a deposit box.That's it.Fourteen million dollars.Fourteen million dollars! Where is it? Supposed to be in a bank in the Caymans, but Jack emptied all the accounts.He ripped me off.So why is it that you think he is the one who took the money? Of course he's the one.Last man he k*lled, he rushed me to go to Paris to pick up the insurance checks.- The million dollars for Leo Gergis? - That's right.Jack wanted an accountant's check straight away.He wouldn't tell me why.I should've known then he was going to betray me.The other names of the homeless.She didn't k*ll him.She doesn't even know he was dead.Not to mention, the missing 14 million.It's not anywhere Bernard had access to.What about mademoiselle? Same story.We had her safe deposit box opened.It was just insurance policies.So there's a third musketeer, who k*lled Bernard and took the money.What sunny part of the world do you wanna start looking for him? Look who's here.The insurance companies sent him to help us recoup their money.- Hello, Mr.Stevens.- You arrested someone.- That's right.- Did you find the money? - Not yet.- Haven't they told you where it is? Apparently, they don't know.Well, how is that possible? - We'll find out.- How are you going to find out? My partner would love to explain it to you.I've got work to do.Mr.Stevens, why don't we just go in here.Right in there.I offended her.Well, she was uncomfortable.She thought that you were staring at her.I gave her too much eye contact.I try to watch myself, but sometimes I forget.Well, you were preoccupied with the money.My employers are very concerned about the money.Well, there's no trace of it.The man who engineered the plan and did the killings is dead.We arrested his girlfriend.Well, she probably has the money.Women like money.So do men.That's because women like men with money.This is everything we have on the case.They were planning on k*lling two more people, 16 total.I haven't figured out the pattern yet.Just because things are in physical or temporal proximity doesn't mean they're connected.What, now you're saying that there are coincidences? No.A coincidence is two unrelated events that appear alike, happening at the same time.Two brothers dying in two car accidents on the same day.Yes, but if you look at those two events carefully, there are more differences between them than there are similarities.They're not really alike.Excuse me.If I look at someone when I talk to them for more than two thirds of the time, I seem aggressive.But if I look at them for less than one third of the time, I seem dishonest.I'm still practicing this.You two looked like you were having so much fun.Oh, he's an interesting man.These are the insurance policies from the French girl's safe deposit box.Leo Gergis' policy had a letter attached.It's from the insurance company."The medical exam revealed the presence of a heart murmur."Mr.Gergis contacted us by phone "and informed us he had a congenital heart condition."As a result, we attached a rider to the policy to cover this preexisting condition." Gergis called them by phone, out of the blue? This homeless guy? Doesn't make sense.Or someone else pretending to be Gergis.Jack Bernard, or the guy who k*lled him? Well, I mean, Jack wouldn't know his full medical history.But you know who would? Did you know your brother had a heart condition? Yes.He was born with it.What does that have to do with anything? Did you ever talk to an insurance company about it? About his heart condition? No.Why? What happened? Someone took out insurance on your ex-husband, a million dollars' worth, and then they k*lled him.You see, it was an opportunity that they couldn't resist.But his death wasn't a total waste, was it, Mr.Gergis? Of course it was.His death, his life, it was just a waste.His kids wouldn't agree.Thanks to the insurance, they both have a college fund.Oh, your brother-in-law didn't tell you? He set up a trust fund for a million dollars in their names.It didn't take a lot of detective work to figure that out.Ben, what are they saying? You took insurance out on Leo? No.No, but he found out who did.And after Leo was k*lled, he blackmailed them into giving him the money.How did you figure it out, Mr.Gergis? You got ahold of the guys who did the medical exam? Is that how you found Jack Bernard? I never thought they would k*ll him.I thought they had some other kind of scam going.But once Leo was dead, you thought you'd do something for your family.He never took responsibility.When did Jack give you the money? Friday, a week ago.Was he alone? Yes.He seemed pretty jumpy.He kept asking me who I had talked to about Leo.Meaning the police? No.He wanted to know about other people.Other people? Other people connected to the scheme? What, he didn't want them to find out about Leo? That's the impression I got.That he was trying to pull a fast one on them.The girl already knew about Leo.Jack had another partner.That's who he was worried about.Leo wasn't part of the original plan.The plan wasn't to k*ll 16 people.It was to k*ll 15.- Leo was Jack's pet project.- Jack got greedy.And Jack got himself k*lled.Progress? Looking for the third musketeer.Leo Gergis, he skews the whole design.Look, he was the only one that was k*lled within a month of the policies being issued.And he was the only one that was found dead in an industrial zone.You take him out and Well, patterns become clear.The days that the bodies were found, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.Wednesday, Friday, Sunday.And the blocks that the bodies were left on.The 500 block, the 400 block, the 600, the 300, the 700 block.Minus one, plus two, minus three, plus four.Dozens of small patterns.I'm finding dozens of small patterns.Jack Bernard thought of this? No.The one time that he tried to set up a k*ll on his own, he botched it and Jack doesn't have the skill set to do this.Maybe his computer did.I'd hate to see what the assistant chief adjuster's office looks like.This is how Wally likes it.It's out of the way, huh? That's right.Wally's not much of a people person, but set him loose on a claim He has kids.Hope springs eternal.- You notice the windows? - Mmm-hmm, different windows.Different houses.And that shadow there, that one was taken from a car.Did Wally move recently? I don't think so.He's still with his wife and kids? If he wasn't, I think he would've mentioned something.Our hunch was right.Wally's divorced, as of two years ago.His wife remarried six months later.Remarried well, judging by the house in the photo.She's a paralegal.She married one of the partners at her firm.She got a restraining order against Wally.He was showing up at her house every week with flowers, asking when she was coming home.Mr.Stevens was humiliated.No wonder he didn't tell his coworkers.It wouldn't have occurred to him to tell them.Has it occurred to you, you're looking for something that's not there? "Symptoms include the need to create and duplicate patterns."Impairment of nonverbal behavior, such as eye-to-eye gaze."Inflexible adherence to routines, "often coupled with high intelligence "and a tendency to become preoccupied with a particular subject." What are you describing? Asperger's syndrome.It's a high functioning form of autism.It's why Wally Stevens can't empathize.It's why he can't connect.It's why this pattern is in there.Time and space.These are the first five people who were insured in sequence.There, this is the pattern.And the same pattern for the next five.And the next five.That leaves one pattern unfinished.It's very visual.Juries like visuals.I wish we could show them the missing millions in Mr.Stevens' possession or anything, for that matter, beyond these abstractions.Does Weehawken sound abstract to you? Hey.Sorry to barge in on you so late.Something came up.We wanted to run it by you.Have you had dinner yet? I was going to heat something up.Hope you like Chinese food.Yes.Yes, I do.We'll need plates.We would've come by earlier, but my partner had to look at houses.Yeah, I'm gonna buy.I like this place.Looks like you got a lot of rooms.Aren't you gonna ask me where I'm looking? - Where are you looking? - Whitestone.It's where my parents grew up.My partner's very sentimental.Well, it's what I can afford.What made you pick this house? I don't know.My wife picked it.I noticed that there's a grocery store around the corner.Yes, it's very convenient.That's what I need, you know, a deli.Something like that.Yeah, just in walking distance.I like the one you looked at today.Off Francis Louis Boulevard.It's near Beachhurst.I'm not sure if I saw any delis around there though.There's a deli on 154th Street.Hey, can I write that down? Could you show me where? Sorry.One egg roll or two? One.Please.Thank you.Bach-ing it tonight, huh? Wife out with the kids? Yes, they're out.You know what, you should You should ask him.I bet he knows.My brother moved into a new house two months ago, and I'm sure I'm gonna get lost getting there.- It's off 495, Exit 2.- Weehawken.Yes, Palisade Avenue.He says I take a right turn and go under a bridge and The bridge is to the left.Palisade Avenue is three miles to the left.Oh, I better mark this down before I forget.I have no sense of direction.Do you mind? Well, I wonder where that wife of yours is, huh? It's getting late.She's out.- She's not out.She's gone.- She'll be back.Sure, soon as she divorces that rich lawyer she married.But that's not gonna happen, 'cause women like money.Isn't that what you said? "Women like men with money." And you don't have any money.No.No, I don't.Not even, let's say, 15 million dollars? I don't have 15 million dollars.How about 13 million? I don't have 15 million dollars.I don't have that money.Yes, you do.Because it's the only way you know how to get your wife back.Because you could never offer her what she really wanted, offer her a real relationship.No.I'm a good husband.I'm loyal.I pay the bills.Obviously it wasn't enough, so you hooked up with Jack Bernard.I'm a good husband.I did not k*ll anybody.He had the inside track on the homeless, the French girlfriend.And all you had was sheer analytical genius.I didn't k*ll anybody.Not me.Yes, you did, Wally.You left your mark all over the scheme.The piece of music that you play, over and over.Five bars, each with five notes.You like the number five.Five toes, five fingers, five photos.And the pattern that you make with them.And these dishes But you're not aware of it.But can you see it now? No matter how hard you strive for chaos, it always comes out like this.I didn't k*ll anybody.You can't connect me to this.I'm not a k*ller.You can't connect me.You connected yourself.You're very thorough.You scouted each place where you would dump the bodies.That's why you know Whitestone so well.And Weehawken.They're where you planned to dump the other two victims you never got around to k*lling.Don't you remember? You told us when you met us."They always betray themselves." Why would I do that? Why would I keep making this pattern? I wouldn't do that.Because you can't help yourself.Because you don't know.I wouldn't do that.Look, I I photocopied this for you.They only started diagnosing Asperger's in 1994.You would have been too old by then.It's why you make patterns.It's why you're not very good with people and your wife left you.Oh.Oh.It's me.That's me.Why didn't somebody tell me? Why Why didn't they Why didn't they tell me? Nothing is the same since, since they left.Nothing is the same since they left.I want everything to be the same.I want everything to be the same.The house is so empty.This house is so empty.Nothing's the same.Nothing's the same.As soon as his lawyer gets here, he wants to make a full statement.To think his murders almost went undetected.Well, his murders did.It was Jack Bernard's that didn't.Criminal mastermind.They don't make them like they used to.I'm sure he'd like a pen pal.

I brought you coffee.Miss? Oh! One thing I learned in prison, Mom, is not to k*ll the girls I have sex with.I want you to feel good, Mark, good and powerful.- Is this how you want me? - Yeah.Yeah.I've been watching you running around the reservoir, watching your butt in those little silver running shorts.running around the reservoir, watching your butt in those little silver running shorts.All you're gonna do is watch? Shut up.Shut up.I'm gonna fill your mouth with sand, so you start choking.Get all tight.I'm going out now.What's the matter, Mom? I know you've been watching me.What is it? You're a malignant narcissist.What did you say? Never mind.Have a nice night.And try not to hurt anyone.I don't remember, all right.It was 15 years ago.Come on.I just want to see where you k*lled Mandy.I'm gonna k*ll you if you don't knock it off! Where's your coke? Just show me.Okay, like, you hooked up with her at the bar that night.She was wearing a little black dress, like this.- I'm sick of this crap! - Mark, wait up.Wait up.Hey, Mark! Mark, wait up! Mom, where'd you hide the coffee? Mom.Mom.No.No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! No.Law & Order CI A co-worker found her.No forcible entry.She lived alone till Dietrich moved in a month ago."My son, the Yuppie k*ller." He's why we're here.Anybody seen him? Not since yesterday.The neighbors heard them arguing on and off though.Life with a psychopath.I'll talk to the co-worker when she's ready.Well, the k*ller caught her behind the ear.She She crawled to here.TheThe back of her nightgown is, is Is bunched up, but the front has been pulled down to cover her.Someone was worried about her modesty? The girl Dietrich k*lled in the park didn't rate that kind of consideration.That lady's ready.I talked to Laura last night, just to make sure that she wanted a ride to work.We're fact-checkers for a publisher in Long Island City.Was she expecting company last night? No, Laura didn't socialize much.Especially since her son came home.How was that going, between her and Mark? Well, she was hoping for the best, you know, but they argued.And then she just stopped talking about him altogether.Mrs.Dietrich's cell phone is missing.Has anyone been reading this paper? No, it was out in the hallway.I brought it in.I'm gonna need this bagged, exactly as is.We Let's go for a ride.I I'm gonna need a Polaroid of this, please.You all set? Mark, how you doing? I'm sorry I had to deliver the bad news over the phone.Yeah, you figured out my mom lent me her phone, huh? Uh-huh.We wake you up? My girlfriend and I were just waking up, so Where are we going? You know, Mark, Detective Eames thought that you were good for this.I thought you went on the lam.Except you left your Xanax behind and your mom's money.It was on her dresser.Are you ready? You found her like this? Yes.See.Why? I just I mean, can we cover her up? She wouldn't want to be seen like this.She was a very modest woman.We need to go downtown, so you can sign some papers.I meant to ask you.Did your mother have any enemies? She got some phone calls, a few years back, from the brother of the girl.Mandy Johanssen, the girl you strangled in the park.By mistake.I wrote a letter to that family, telling them how sorry I was.But you can never be too sorry for some people.Last night, where were you again? With my girlfriend, Chantal Fielding.Does she know about you? She knows it was a long time ago.Gena will help you fill out the forms.Oh, uh All those? It's what you have to do when a member of your family gets m*rder*d.You tracked mud in with your shoes.Yeah, sorry.It's horse manure.APARTMENT OF CHANTAL FIELDING MONDAY, JANUARY 15 Mark was really upset when he heard about his mom.I felt so sorry for him.I felt sorry for his mom.Did you ever meet her? No.I only met Mark a couple of weeks ago.I'm sorry, I dropped something.So, what did you and Mark do last night? We went out to dinner, and then came back here.Fell asleep watching TV.Gee, you two sound just like my parents.That's probably why Mark appreciates it, 'cause it's so, you know, ordinary.Especially with a guy like Mark.You know, he's a magnet for extreme attention.Absolutely.You should've seen the skank he was with when I met him.Yeah, I know the type.m*rder groupies.Mark said she started writing him in prison.These women, they like to visit m*rder scenes.It gets them hot.You never were tempted to, you know, ask Mark? / No.Because, you know, it's not that far away.It's just on the bridle path where they walk the horses.In fact, it's where they found the girl Mandy.She had a smell of horse manure.Like this, you know? Like the mud on your boots.Like the mud on Mark's shoes.How was it, Chantal? Did you ask Mark to call you Mandy while he wrapped a scarf around your neck? That is so sick.You know, Mark, he told us that there's three varieties of m*rder groupies, victims, psychos, shrinks.He said with you, he's got three mints in one.Oh, that loser! All right.You wanna know what he did? We went into the park, and then he freaked out.I had to walk home by myself.And what got him upset? I don't know.He was whining all night about his mother being mad at him.What time did he show up here? I don't know, about 6:30 in the morning.He curled up like a little baby and went to sleep.Look, if I k*lled my mother, - I'd be in South America by now.- I just wanted you to know that your attempt - You said yourself, I didn't run away.- to deceive us didn't go unnoticed.You forgot one thing, the morning paper.- Look, my mom has it delivered.- The first officer to arrive on the scene found it outside.Where you put it, when you brought it in, when you came back from the park./ No.You read the sports section, you k*lled your mom.You slipped the sports section back into the newspaper./ No! Put it back outside, only, you put it back in the wrong section.- At this point, Mark's invoking his rights.- No, no, no.- Look, I wanna tell them what happened.- No, no, no, Mark.I just wanna get it over with.I got home, I was drunk, and I blacked out, okay? I came to.I went looking for my mom and I found her.And she was already dead.I got scared.And you're saying that there's this huge chunk of time that you have no memory of.I'm saying that I passed out in the living room.I I did not k*ll my mother.Your mother told her friends you fought.Yeah, well, when I first got out, yeah.All that lecturing and moralizing.- But not lately.- So that was the problem.- No, we were barely speaking.- That's the problem, right there.- She'd given up on you.- Yeah, right, so what do I care? She called me a malignant narcissist.That was the last thing she said to me.She was the only one I had left out here.Why would I want to k*ll her? I mean, why would I want to do that to myself? When someone is k*lled by receiving a blow to the head, it sends up a fine spray of blood that's unrecognizable to the To the human eye.Once the lab gets done with their microscopic inspection of your clothes, we'll have you cooked six ways to Sunday.She was my mother.There was no way I k*lled her.Why did you stop? Look, when you tell a suspect that there's incriminating evidence on the way, they They get quiet.They They start to try to remember what they missed.You know, they don't keep claiming their innocence.Or he really doesn't remember k*lling her.Mark's mother, she called him a malignant narcissist.That's a clinical term that psychiatrists use amongst themselves.She has no background in psychology.She stopped talking to him.She withdrew.There's something going on with her.Mark Dietrich should've gotten life for choking that girl.He caught a break, but not this time.Just get the evidence and bury him.The only change that I can think of is, we stopped riding home together three weeks ago.I thought she was taking a class.She was always home by 9:30.She made notes."Remorseless charming, predatory." Anybody we know? "Shallow emotional affect, "rehabilitation is rare." You know, I Look, what, was she fact-checking a psychiatric text? No.We only check statistical data.Rolls of nickels.Do you have any vending machines that only take nickels? No.What costs a nickel these days? Microfilm machines.They use them in the library to copy newspapers.These are the books that she checked out of the psychology section."Nurture-Born K*llers, "Patterns of the Sexual Predator." Maybe she liked seeing Mark's name in print.No, that's the thing.Mark's name wouldn't be in here.These books are about chronic sexual offenders.Mark's strangling of Mandy Johanssen, it was called a one-time incident, completely out of character for Mark.What'd you find? A clerk said Mrs.Dietrich checked out newspapers from the summer of ' Besides Mandy's m*rder in September, there was another Central Park story that ran that whole year.The Reservoir Runner.Two months earlier in July, she was dragged into the woods and r*ped by four kids.Maybe Mrs.Dietrich thought Mark had something in common with them.Something that made her withdraw from him.Something that compelled her to do research three weeks ago.Something she saw or heard.Well, three weeks ago, that's before he started seeing Chantal.She said he was with his prison pen pal.The word she used was skank.What happened with Mark? You corresponded with him for what? Seven years.Did he open up to you? About Mandy? It was an accident.Mark needs to feel powerful, but he doesn't need to k*ll.If only his mother had given him that kind of understanding.I read about what happened to her.She wasn't good for him.You met her? I didn't need to.I saw her apartment.Lots of beiges, neutral tones.It's stifling.When were you in her apartment? Like three weeks ago.Well, that is interesting, 'cause that's when Mark said that his mother turned cold on him.But he couldn't figure out why.I can.I left my camera in his room.She must've seen the video.A video of you healing Mark's wounds? I helped him give a voice to his sexual fantasies.Like what? About choking.with a scarf, like Mandy? He had a whole scenario about silver running shorts and filling my mouth with sand.Once you get to know him, Mark's a very creative soul.Thanks, Naomi.We'll be in touch.The Reservoir Runner was described as wearing silver running shorts, but there was nothing in any of the articles about sand.Laura Dietrich heard her son's fantasies about a runner in the park.She goes to the library and she confirms some of the details.And she's a fact-checker.Her next move would have been to the source.The detectives who broke the case.TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6 Mark Dietrich's mother? No kidding.Never made the connection.She said she was checking facts for an article on the case.Which facts in particular? What the victim was wearing, was she choked? Did she ask about sand? She asked if the attacker put sand in the victim's mouth.But that wasn't made public, right? Well, not at the time, no.Does this have to do with the m*rder? Laura Dietrich might've suspected her son committed the r*pe.It may be why he k*lled her.That would be tragic because he did not do that r*pe.My partner and I got those guys.There was semen found on the victim, semen that didn't match any of them.Did Mrs.Dietrich ask about that? No, but if she did, I would've told her it was a g*ng r*pe and that we only got four of the guys.Now, maybe Mark Dietrich, the Yuppie k*ller, was running with the homeboys that night, but I doubt it.Well, how do you explain that he knew unpublicized details of the r*pe? He was incarcerated in the same facility with those four punks, wasn't he? Cons tell each other everything.But like you said, Detective Marston, you know, I can't imagine a yuppie k*ller sh**ting the breeze with four homeboys.Look, we got taped confessions.A lot of people worked a lot of hours to get those animals off the street.Us guys don't remember what it was like back then, but I've had a lot of women tell me they were afraid to walk out in broad daylight.Anything I can do, give me a call.I remember.Marston and his partner Roscoe were heroes around our house, the way they got four kids to confess in one night.Yeah.I'd like to see how they did that.I'm just saying, Nishan, your friends are gonna tell the tale.You finished with that can of soda? You want another one? Uh, no.I ain't mean to leave it there.I'm sorry.I'll clean it up.- Come on, you were there.- Man, I told you, we didn't go anywhere near the reservoir.We didn't r*pe no woman.You're not helping yourself out, kid.Your friend Nishan already said he pulled down her silver shorts.No, that ain't right.And he said you held down her left leg.I didn't.I didn't touch her never.Monty, if you keep denying while all your friends are cutting deals, it's gonna go real bad for you.Don't you wanna help us? Yeah, I do.All you gotta say is that you touched her left leg.Just touched it.You don't have to admit to anything else, just that.And then you can go home tonight.Um, do you have the tape of this confession? They wanted him to say he touched her left leg.This is the confession that played for the jury.And then Nishan took down her shorts and got on her.What'd you do? I touched her leg.Her right leg.It's all I did.Left leg, right leg.The point is, the kid admitted he was there.There were inconsistencies in all four confessions.And not one of them admitted actually raping her.Look, if they didn't do it, if they weren't even there, why in the world would they confess? - Because they were afraid to disappoint.- Disappoint who? Marston and Roscoe.Look.I'm just saying, Nishan, your friends are gonna tell the tale.You finished with that can of soda? You want another one? Uh, no.I ain't mean to leave it there.I'm sorry.So, Marston is drawing attention to the soda can, so that when anyone watches it, they know that Nishan had something to drink.So nobody can say he was denied food and drink.He's being a smart detective.These kids were interrogated for 30 hours with no lawyers and almost no contact with their parents.Marston's being polite.He's being very nice.But look Look at the kid's reaction.You got someplace I can throw it away.I'll clean it up.I'll clean it up.The kid thinks that Marston is reproaching him for leaving the can on the table.He is desperately trying to please the one guy he thinks can get him out of trouble.I mean, the jury never saw this.Never saw the way that Roscoe and Marston played these kids.All they saw was the finished product.These confessions, they're nothing but vapor.Mark Dietrich is the real thing.He did this r*pe.All four recanted their confessions.Once their lawyers got ahold of them.Two dozen witnesses saw them in the park, running in a pack, snatching purses.Dietrich knew the details.I agree with Detective Marston's explanation.Dietrich shared a prison yard with the four rapists.So, years later, he's having sex, he just happens to dredge up what they told him? Now, that is incredible.Tales of forcible sex excite him.There's an easy way out of this.The department still has Dietrich's DNA from the Mandy Johanssen case.We run it against the unknown DNA from the reservoir r*pe.I can just feature what that little psycho told you.She especially liked the part about the silver running shorts.I'm a sack artist.Improvisation is the key to my creativity.Almost as much as the bit about stuffing her mouth full of sand.If I understand you, you've never actually seen this alleged video.No.But his mother did.She even looked up the true story that inspired it.These are the newspaper articles that she checked out of the library and books.That's how she found out about the, you know, the stuff about malignant narcissism.She even called the detective who investigated the case.She thought you were good for it.If she thought that, she would've told me.You ever seen this woman? - No.- You sure? Your DNA matched the semen on her running shorts.Yeah.Okay, yeah, I remember her now.I met her in the park.So? We were warming up before jogging.We started talking, - went back to her apartment.- Where? All I remember is, it wasn't close enough.And there was a bed.We had sex.I must've dripped on her shorts.And then she went back to the park to jog, and I went home to sleep.What, you had consensual sex with a runner that you met at the reservoir, the same night the Reservoir Runner was r*ped? And it never, you know, crossed your mind to say anything? Well, how would he know that's who he had sex with? Her name and photo were never released.I still wouldn't have known.You never exchanged names? It was the '80s.Women were a lot more fun.I don't understand.Is there some doubt about who r*ped me? This man's DNA matched the semen on your running shorts.This guy doesn't look like somebody who'd bash me in the head with a rock and put sand in my mouth.Miss Stephens, if you can't remember anything about the att*ck, who told you about the sand? Detective Marston.So he's kept in touch with you.He's called every few months.Has he called you recently? A couple of weeks ago.He said he's worried about me.I didn't know policemen like that existed.APARTMENT OF DETECTIVE TED MARSTON FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9 DNA match, huh? Where do you want me to start? The samples were improperly stored.Some genius blew his nose in the petri dish.You gotta hear Dietrich's explanation.He hooked up with Jane Stephens before her run, went back to her apartment to have sex.Yeah, I can go with that.Just for drill, you should check with her.But she doesn't remember what happened that day.He knows that.Because you've monitored her condition over the years.You didn't see her that first night.She lost three-quarters of her blood.She doesn't need to remember what they did to her.That's my job.Detective Marston, we understand there was extraordinary pressure to break this case.Those kids fit a profile Forget it.There were no mistakes, no rush to judgment.We matched the DNA.Dietrich has no evidence to back up his story.The DA says it's open and shut.You know, Al Roscoe and I went over to Jane Stephens' apartment the day after she was r*ped, just to look for a number of her next-of-kin.We found a condom wrapper on the floor next to her bed.Now, maybe, that's what Dietrich used to have sex with her.Ask Al Roscoe, I'm sure he'll remember.He could've just said he was wrong about the kids, a good-faith mistake.- What's he afraid of? - Yes.Okay.Thank you.I found Al Roscoe.He's at the Saint Albans Parish cemetery up near Ghent.He d*ed two weeks ago.His handgun discharged while he was cleaning it.Wait a minute, I don't understand, Detective.Why are you volunteering this information? Because you're going to find out about it anyway.It's exculpatory evidence.Well, was there anything else besides the wrapper? - You remember the brand? - No.All your boy needs to know, is I saw a wrapper.The simpler, the better.Are we clear? My father didn't like talking about that case.That's why he moved us up here, away from all the attention.We looked at the police report of your father's death.It had all the The earmarks of an accidental sh**ting.He would've done that for you.For the insurance.I just hope I'm doing the right thing.I got this in the mail, the day after he d*ed.He was police chief here until last year.I want my kids to remember him as a hero."It's something I've been running from for 15 years." "Last weekend, Ted Marston called." "It's all going to catch up." "Before Ted and me began our interrogation of those young men, "we agreed that regardless of their innocence," "we were going to get confessions out of them." "That's what we did." "Even though the more we questioned them," "the more it was obvious they were innocent."I'm ashamed of what I did.I can't live with it anymore." Some good-faith mistake.They premeditated framing those kids.Marston was looking at prison time if word got out.Or if Laura Dietrich got the case reopened.This letter is of no value as evidence.Mr.Roscoe isn't here to authenticate it.It can't be used at trial.Marston knows that the only person who can tie him to the frame up is dead.There's no evidence to tie him to Laura Dietrich's m*rder.And thanks to his condom wrapper story, we can't even make an ironclad case against Mark Dietrich for the reservoir r*pe.Marston's sitting pretty snug in the saddle.We need to put a burr under the saddle.You are considering vacating the convictions on the r*pe, aren't you? I was a kid.I was trying to keep from going to jail.Detective Marston said the other guys were gonna put the weight on me, so I just said I touched her arm.Detective Marston suggested you say that? / Yeah.He said he would try to help me, so long as I play along.Mr.Carver, you asked us here to discuss a new development.We matched the semen on the victim's shorts to a suspect we We've come to believe acted alone.Are you preparing to vacate the convictions? Vacate, what does that mean? Your record will be clean.It means, Nishan, that you spent all those years in prison for nothing.Ten years because you trusted Detective Marston.Well, that changed you in ways that you never wanted.I I don't know what could compensate you for that.Oh, I do.I know exactly.A $100 million.Those punks are suing for $100 million.I hear the city and the department are prepared to settle, but that proposed settlement doesn't include you.You see what's going on here? I'm being set up.We need a strategy.The Detective's Endowment cannot get involved if you were derelict or if you acted out of bounds of your official duties.What's that supposed to mean? You're the Detective's Endowment, I'm a detective.You'd better just talk to the DA.I'm gonna go broke defending myself.You gotta have a talk with the Endowment.I'm sorry.Look, we had suspects.The city was in a panic.Women couldn't sleep without worrying that some guy was gonna r*pe them in their beds.This isn't fair.These guys were heroes.We need to stand by our own.It's not just the DA's office.It's public perception.What if we had him help us break Dietrich.Would that change the perception? We both saw how he handled those kids.He's good.And nobody knows the reservoir case better than him.- I think she has a point.- What're you talking about here? We need to get Dietrich on the reservoir r*pe, If we wanna get him for his mother's m*rder.You want my help? Yeah.You'd be staying ahead of the curve, you know, doing what you always do, getting at the truth like any good cop.All right.All right.Anything to make sure that the right guy goes down for the count.Where you wanna do it? CENTRAL PARK TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 13 We were back there, when we started talking.No, no, the witnesses said they saw her warming up around here.I'm just telling you what I remember, all right.Mr.Dietrich, as I explained to your attorney, we need to eliminate you as a suspect in the r*pe in order to defend ourselves against this lawsuit.How you doing, Detective? Mark, this is Detective Marston.- He knows this case inside out.- Maybe you've heard of him.He's the one who got the confessions out of those kids.Thanks for helping us out today.You know, Mark is not so clear on how him and Jane Stephens got back to her apartment./ Uh-huh.This path hooks back up to the traverse.Her place is on West 81st, so they would've cut through here.You okay? Come on, I'll put my arm around you.- You won't slip.- No, no, no, I What's wrong, Mark? I'm not going down there.Not with Not with these on.Oh, no, sure, sure, sure.Here you go.They cleaned it up since the last time you've been here.Cut out a lot of the underbrush, put up a light.The rocks Rocks are still here.And the ground, still sandy.Right over there, is where they found her, half-dead, barely a pulse.Look, I don't know anything about that.I don't wanna stay here.Mark, you don't wanna help us anymore? I mean, what are we supposed to make of that? I told you, all right, I talked to the woman, we went back to her place and we had sex, okay? I mean, didn't you see the condom wrapper there? Right? Isn't that what he told you? I might've confused it with another r*pe victim, Mark.I mean, I work a lot of cases.But this girl's apartment, the bed was made, everything was tidy.The doorman saw her go out.If he would've seen her come back with you, don't you think he would've said something? Why don't you say something? I mean, what did you let them bring me here for? - Mark, I think you should - What? You're fired, okay? He sees the writing on the wall, same as everyone.You know what you need to do here, Mark? You need to cut yourself the best deal you can.I'm not going back in.No, there's a way of telling the story, Mark, that can work for you.You hooked up with a girl on the path, you brought her down here for a little intimacy, consensual intimacy.I, I, I see where this is going.This is a good story, Mark.Things started developing between you two, and all of a sudden, she hurt you.Squeezed you a little too hard, got too tough, and you lost it.The sex was consensual.A straight as*ault with mitigation, isn't that right, Counselor? Under those circumstances, yes.And all you gotta say, Mark, is she hurt you.She hurt you, and you got scared.Isn't that the way it happened? You say it, and everything falls into place.She hurt you, and you got scared.She hurt me.I got I got scared.Look, I didn't wanna hurt her.I just I got scared.I got scared.That's very good.You're almost home free.All that's left to talk about is, is your mother.My mother? Well, you helped Detective Marston clear up his old case.Now he wants to help you with this other thing.I mean, we all do.I didn't I didn't k*ll my mother.What you said is, you don't remember.What's it gonna look like to a jury? Please tell him that he has practically no chance with a jury.You have to stay out of court, my friend.You have to talk to us.I would I wouldn't k*ll her.It's obvious you care about your mother.Even in death, you cared about her, you had respect.You remember? You remember what you told me that morning that you saw her in her nightgown? About her modesty? Oh, he was so concerned about her being covered.I mean, doesn't that say something? Tells me, you're a good son, Mark.The way you pulled her nightgown down.After she was dead, to cover her.A good son would do that, a respectful son.Yeah.How did you find out about that stuff? Isn't that what you're talking about? It was pulled down over her panties.You tell me.It was bunched up like this? Maybe in the heat of the moment, you You just forgot to do it.Maybe you thought about pulling it back down, you know, so you could implicate someone.Someone like Mark.And what, you were in too much of a hurry, you just forgot to yank it back down? You think that I k*lled What, you think I'd k*ll her? You're nuts! As we speak, we're executing search warrants on your home, your office, your car.Oh, no, no, this is bull.Yeah, no, we staged the picture four weeks ago.We pushed the nightgown back up just to trick you.What're you coming after me for? You got this loser here, he's good for it.Yeah, for the fact he didn't do it.You did.You're under arrest for m*rder.You son of a bitch, you k*lled her.You k*lled my mother! Get out of here.You'll never make it stick.A cop k*lling a witness, isn't that the death penalty? It certainly is.What you're gonna wanna do here, Ted, is cut the best deal you can.There is a window of opportunity, Mr.Marston.But given what you've put this city through, I'm not disposed to leave it open longer.You have from here back up to that path to make up your mind.Okay.I'll take the deal.- I'll take it.- I'll get back to you.This must've been a very lonely place
02x16 - Cuba LibreQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:23In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.Just eight days more to go.I'm going crazy thinking about it.Me, too, sweetheart.That's enough of that.You are so funny.He never wants to see me again? Your father's upset.You didn't visit him while he was away.I had no access.She took me off the visitors list.Jack, you know I only do what Milt asks.Stop.Just stop.You should be ashamed of yourself.- I'm sorry, Jack.He's - Don't worry.Milt wants to make sure you get what's coming to you.Don't forget your brothers behind the wall now.I'll keep it real.I'm gonna miss you, Milton.Same here, brother.Come here.Maybe your luck will change now that you don't have to play me.But who will make dinner for Mr.Milt? We'll figure something out.Tonight, I want him all to myself.Oh, I don't want to set off the security system when he gets here.You want me to show you how? Uh, no.Just turn the stupid thing off.Okay.Look at this.Two years here turned me into a lean machine.So what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get out? Oh, Milt! - Oh! You're the only one.- My little sweetheart.The only one! Baby.Must be the little blue pills.It's like it has wings on it.Wings! Oh! Must be dinner.I'm famished.I'll get it.You go take your shower.Pam? Pam! No! Those bastards! You bastards! Law & Order CI These entry wounds, chest, shoulder, knee.The sh**t had no control and couldn't resist ripping her earring off.Like some subway punk.He sprayed the doorway in an arc, even hit the upper window.You know, the sh*ts came from down below, but not at the bottom of the stairs.Check the service entrance.Well, I got five, six, seven nine millimeter casings.He rang the doorbell up there and ran down here to hide? No.He rang the doorbell down here.He thought the service entrance was the main door.Here.She answers the door.He's surprised.He sh**t wild, probably one-handed, - cocked to one side.- Like in the gangster flicks.He's not used to the recoil.He loses control of the piece.She'd ordered dinner.The security cameras must have been off, so she had to go to the door to see who was there.Why were they off? The security system's very sophisticated.My wife, less so.She must have turned it off when she sent the maid home.Well, let's talk about who might have wanted your wife dead.Any candidates? Nobody.She was an angel.We had just finished making beautiful love.They were after me.All due respect, even in a snowstorm, no one would mistake her for you.You think that's funny? I have enemies everywhere.Like your ex-business partner.You were convicted of hiring a hit man to k*ll him.Do I look incompetent? Hmm? If I wanted him dead, he would have been dead.Your conviction was a frame-up, by your enemies.Exactly.My competitors.In the clothing business? This "Winter Clothes For All Seasons." This is the original store.Yeah, up in Harlem.That's my dad on the left, and that's me.Who's the man whose knee you're sitting on? Our tailor.Morris Swope.Long gone.So you built the chain from one store.And the bastards came after me because I refused to be undersold! Chang.Chang! Nitro.Worried about being poisoned? Can't be too safe.Great wealth meets great paranoia.Not a healthy combination.Pierre's, the restaurant Milt said they ordered from, had no record of any order.He told his wife he ordered dinner.That's why she opened the door.And knowing what was coming, made beautiful love to her.Well, that's what made it more exciting for him.Going by his trial testimony, the man's all about suspicion and revenge.Revenge for what? Don't tell me the lovely Mrs.Winters was cheating on the old coot while he was still in prison.Apparently not, if you believe the cook, the maid, the driver, and the Pilates instructor.Milt loved Pam.Pam loved Milt.Everything was hunky-dory.Well, there might be one Winters who's not closing ranks.Milton Junior.He was called as a character witness at his father's trial, but he never showed up.My mother taught me if you can't say anything nice about someone So you skipped your dad's trial.And the reason you didn't visit him in jail? Pamela had him take my name off the visitors list.She had him wrapped around her little finger.I won't say she had it coming, but You know, usually, in a m*rder investigation, people try to hide their joy at the victim's death.I'll try to remember that.You're an only child, right? Yeah./ Well, with his wife out of the way, you stand to inherit.Dad made a point of cutting me out of his will years ago, so I wouldn't be tempted to k*ll him.That's my dad, always looking out for me.Well, at least you've learned not to take his peculiarities personally.How can I? Dad's sick.A brilliant businessman, but sick.So he would've protected himself from Pamela./ Well, I'm sure.With a pre-nup? Pre-nups, plural.I heard he was having his lawyer redraft the originals.Well, assuming Pamela would go along with a new pre-nup.Gee, suppose she said no.I don't care how many subpoenas you pull out of your ass, you have no right to stick your nose in my legal business.That's the point of getting a subpoena, to give us that right.The material you're after is covered by attorney-client privilege.That privilege was waived when you discussed redrafting the pre-nup with Mrs.Winters.Who said anything about redrafting? - Your son.- What? That rat.He talks to you, and he doesn't talk to me? I can't believe this.Look, if you're gonna get upset, why don't you just wait outside, and we all talk to your lawyer.I see what you're doing.You people will do anything, say anything to pin this on me.The worst scum in the pen have more honor than any of you.I loved my wife.I loved her.You loved her so much, you were drafting a new pre-nup.A pre-nup that increased her stake in his estate as reward for her fidelity during his prison stay.Not that Pamela cared.Money was the least of her concerns.What? It was your idea to give your money away? I mean, guys with your pathology, they usually build an armor around what they have.I'm not taking this bait.I'm not afraid of you.I'm not afraid of this whole machinery of justice.I'm not."Money was the least of her concerns." Very nice.I almost believed you myself.I meant every word of it, Milton.Pam turned out to be a lovely girl."A lovely girl." You should know.What are you saying, Milt? I know what you did, you son of a bitch.- Milt, let Let go.- I know what you did.This pre-nup does speak toward his goodwill.Who's doing this to me? He's dead.Oh, my God.Who's doing this to me? Oh, my God.Oh, my God! Nine millimeter casings.Looks like we got a bold sh**t on our hands./ A bold sh**t on a bicycle, according to the limo driver, who unfortunately didn't see his face.Bastards! The bastards are striking at everyone I love, and you're doing nothing to stop them.Them? / My enemies, you idiot.I'm the target.You know, it looks like he's the one that took all the b*ll*ts.Jack Duvall was only important because of his relationship to me.I'm going home.Rashid! How did he ever get the impression people don't like him? Duvall's files were off-limits.Even his lunch orders fell under attorney-client privilege.Yeah.Luckily, the privilege doesn't extend to his bank records.All we got out of the secretary is that Milt was Duvall's only client.What about Duvall and Mrs.Winters? Secretary have anything to say about them? Just that Duvall always kept his office door open whenever Ms.Winters came in to see him and that he never gave her his private number.Well, Duvall knew how crazy Milt is.Look at this.Over the last few months, Duvall issued a dozen checks from his escrow accounts, all for under $10,000, all to small businesses.For losses from fire damages, accidents.He was helping settle insurance claims.A travel agency in Mott Haven.A beauty salon in Morrisania.They're all in the South Bronx.Where a lot of kids learn how to sh**t from watching gangster flicks.Have you ever seen this guy? He's a lawyer, Jack Duvall.No, I don't have much use for lawyers.Well, this lawyer wrote a $9,000 check to JC's Beauty Spa.And that's you, isn't it? I'm Solomon.JC is my wife Jaqueetha.It's her place.She had a gypsy cab, dollar van accident a while back.It could be for that.Why don't we ask Jaqueetha? I want you to soak your hand in this.Is that what it was for? A gypsy cab accident a while back? I whiplashed my neck.That's what it was for.Those guys are crazy drivers.You're lucky they had insurance.Is this your son? Uh-huh.My boy.And there he is again.He must be, what, 14 in that picture? He's grown a lot.You must be what, 16? Nineteen.Taye, why don't you go upstairs, do your studies.We'll let you get back to business.I recognized her first.She testified at the trial of the boy's real father in '87.Dempsey Powers.You would've been in Germany.I remember hearing about him, the South Bronx Drug King.He had an interesting MO.He used to sh**t his victims straight down through the top of their head to destroy the slug so it couldn't be traced back to his g*n.When they came to arrest him, he sh*t his way out.Wounded nine cops.My dad spent the summer visiting hospitals.But that isn't why he's in jail, is it? No, he claimed self-defense.Told the jury the cops were in the drug business with him and were out to k*ll him.They bought it.He's in jail for k*lling three dope dealers.And now the mother of his kid is getting money from Milt Winters' lawyer.You know, it's funny.Two guys who think that the world is after them found each other.Hey look, I was real kind to that old white man.Gave him a cigarette once.Maybe that's why he sent money to Jaqueetha.Yeah, $9000 for a loosey? Hey, it's different economics inside this wall.In fact, uh, what am I getting for this little sit-down? Two extra phone calls a week for six months and an extra hour of TV a day.- Extra TV.- Yeah.Living large, Dempsey.The point is, I'm still living, after all the b*ll*ts the crooked NYPD threw at me.Yeah, well, that was before our time.We were in the South Bronx.We just happened to drop your name.And I got to tell you, there's still all love for DP on the streets.I'm a legend.A living legend.In the South Bronx, but in here you're what, a guardian angel? Is that why Milt Winters had his lawyer send over 200 grand to businesses that belong to your family and friends? Maybe it was reparations for the sl*ve trade.First week Milt was here, some guy tried to shake him down.That guy ended up with a screwdriver in his neck.Milt was never bothered again.Milt carried himself like a man, so he was treated like one.Especially with you watching his back.He ever talk to you about his wife? I would never turn on my friends.I'm not the NYPD.- This punk's a waste of time.- Yeah, but we're just talking.You know, we noticed that your son's only been up here four times in 16 years.Greenhaven's too far.Yeah? Help us out with Milt.Maybe we can talk to the DA.Move you someplace closer where your son can visit.Come on, Dempsey.What do you think? You know what, I'm going to watch some TV.Oh.So you're gonna You're gonna pass up seeing your son to protect some rich white man.Wow! You know, I think you should sit down, make yourself comfortable.I think we're gonna search your cell.You know what? You can search all you want.You can plant all the phony evidence you want.I ain't afraid of you.You got that? I ain't afraid.We found this inside the mattress.It's probably marked.Cards, girlie magazines.Dempsey Powers' entire world, and kids in the projects think he's a living legend.This isn't much worse than what they have.Except he gets three squares a day.He's short four cards.Queen of diamonds.Jack of clubs.Deuce of spades.Ace, hearts.Queen of diamonds, Milt's wife.Jack of clubs, - Jack Duvall.- It's a hit list? Deuce of spades, Milt Junior.- His own son? - He's on a paranoid fugue.He's cleaning house.Like any good paranoiac, he wants to be there when his enemies go down.I don't know, Dad.You call me out of the blue.I've had so much loss these past two weeks.I need you, Son.I need you close to me now.Let me think about it, Dad.I got to go now.- How about a ride uptown? - No, it's okay.The water taxi will get me there quicker.See you, Dad.Son! Clear! I didn't believe them when they told me.You bastard, how could you? / No! No, it's them.These cops are trying to k*ll me.- They're after me.- For once, you're right.We are after you.Milton Winters, you're under arrest.I told you, I'm a bike messenger.People are trying to jack me all the time.- That's why I was carrying the piece.- What about these? We found them in your mom's apartment? Don't know nothing about them.You don't know what this is? Huh? How about this one? - This one? - They're playing cards? No, Ahmal, signals from Dempsey Powers.You see, some Some rich white dude paid him 200 large to have you k*ll these people.You all are whack.And you're an amateur, 'cause pros don't keep evidence in their mama's apartment.I didn't do these homicides, but whoever did, he's no amateur.He's gangster.Gangster? No.This fool was too busy styling to sh**t straight.He punched out b*ll*ts Using a 90 degree flip.Or maybe the modified John Woo 180 cock.Whichever, he had no control.He put more b*ll*ts in the door than he did in this woman.She looked dead in the picture.This isn't a movie.You did a m*rder in the course of a robbery.That's a death penalty.- I didn't rob nobody.- You took an earring off the woman.Didn't Dempsey tell you not to mess with the bling-bling? I'm telling you, I don't even know DP.Your brother Luther spent time with him up in Greenhaven.Is that how you met DP? Visiting your brother up in Greenhaven? How am I gonna get all the way up there? Subway only stop at 241st Street.All right, you don't have to flip on DP.Try this.You have these three cards.We know that there is a fourth, the ace of hearts.Who is it? Who is the fourth hit? I got no ace.I'm done.Give me a lawyer.Even if this boy flips on Dempsey Powers, we have no corroboration other than generic playing cards from a generic deck.I suggest we have a conversation with Mr.Powers.About what? A plea bargain? What else would we talk to him about? We're gonna cut a deal with a guy who sh*t nine cops? He's already serving life with no parole, and he's merely the subcontractor here.Milt Winters is the author of these murders.These are his targets.And am I wrong to assume that unless we identify the fourth target, Milt Winters will find somebody to finish the job? On what planet do you think Powers is going to cooperate with either the police or the DA? He hates us.He doesn't trust us.Dempsey thinks that we're capable of anything.Let's not disappoint him.As you probably know, Milt Winters' lawyer was sh*t outside the DA's office.Not the smartest call.The place was crawling with officers.My partner's old man was in the 40.Same precinct where you sh*t all those cops.You mean, the crooked cops.What's her daddy's name? Maybe he was on my payroll.The officers got a good look at the person who k*lled the lawyer.Recognize him? Oops.That looks just like your son Taye.My son had nothing to do with it.We have the m*rder w*apon.If you think it was easy to plant fingerprints in '87, just think about what we can do now.You're a devil.You should see me in a blue dress.Yeah, well, I ain't afraid of the devil.You should be afraid of my partner, afraid for your son.I give you what you want, you all leave me and my son in peace? I'll make sure we do, you tell the grand jury what you know and testify at Milt's trial.Oh, man.Old Milt may have come to me for some favors.But, you know, being a man of peace, naturally I turned him down.I would, um, be willing to talk about those favors.The ace of hearts, who is it? Milt lost a lot of weight in prison.Got himself healthy.He started thinking that his doctor kept him sick all those years, to bleed him dry.It's the ace of hearts, his heart doctor, Dr.Chang.Dempsey said no such thing.That's a lie.He and I are brothers.Your brother told us who your fourth target is.If you want any leniency from me, you'll call off any attempt on your doctor's life.My doctor? It's a trick.Can't you see? My brother did not betray me, would not betray me, ever.You don't trust your own son, but you trust Dempsey Powers.More now than ever.I've told him for 30 years to lose weight, to exercise.So what does he do in prison? He loses weight.He exercises.So now he wants to k*ll me? You don't sound alarmed by this.Would alarm help? Milt is the one who lives in fear.You mean paranoia? The fear of death.His father d*ed of a heart att*ck at 37.Milt thinks he lives on borrowed time.How old was Milt when his father d*ed? Sixteen.Somehow he kept his father's store going.Right.Somehow.Dr.Chang, we'll assign a couple of detectives to keep an eye on your office in the city.I don't work in the city anymore.Don't live here either.I moved to Staten Island a year ago.I hardly come into the city at all anymore.Does Milt know you spend all your time on Staten Island? / Yes.He even made a donation to the hospice I started there.Okay.Thank you, Doctor.Someone will take you back to the ferry.If bicycle boy wouldn't visit his brother because the subway didn't go to Greenhaven, how did he figure on getting to Staten Island to sh**t the good doctor? It was a delivery in one of these offices over there.I don't know what office you're talking about.You wanted him to tell you where he was making his delivery.That's what he just did, so he's done.You can't just come over here and point it out to me, Ahmal? No, I'm fine right here, man.Wait, are you afraid of the water? I ain't afraid of some water.I just don't I just stay away from it.- Well, you go over bridges, don't you? - I don't take bridges.- What about the ferry? - I just don't go on water, okay? I stay right over here, on the hard land.That's the biggest bunch of nonsense I ever heard.This is your big day.- You're gonna take a ride on the ferry.- No, no, leave me be./ Come on.It's right over here.Come on.Leave me be.No.No, no, no.Please, please.Please, I don't, I swear.I'm gonna pee myself.Please, just don't.Okay.All right.All right, calm down.Ahmal, calm down.Come on.You don't have to take the ferry.Come on.Come on.It's going to be all right.You can stay right here on the hard land.He was supposed to do the hit on Milt's son.He hesitated.He waited for the son to get away from the water's edge.Now, there's no way that he's gonna take a job sh**ting someone on Staten Island.Fourth victim, the ace of hearts, it's not the doctor.Milt's having somebody else k*lled.Dempsey wouldn't lie to us about that.But he would lie to us if he was having someone k*lled.He's playing us.Yeah, he's playing all of us.Milt contracted those three hits.The fourth one is Dempsey's choice.We may be overestimating Mr.Powers' cunning.The idea he used Milt Winters' k*lling spree to hide a k*lling of his own is Overestimate a guy who put nine cops in the hospital? You can't be serious.And cover the personnel at Greenhaven, starting with the warden.Dempsey might have already made his move.I checked homicides going back two months.This one, last week, in Queens.Eduardo Escobar.sh*t once straight down through the top of the head.- Dempsey's MO.- Who the hell is Eduardo Escobar? A subway mechanic.Married last month.No priors, no known connection to Dempsey Powers.If someone k*lled Escobar on orders from Powers, isn't it reckless to advertise the fact by using Powers' calling card? Reckless and bold.The act of someone proud of his connection to Dempsey Powers.I didn't k*ll no Eduardo Escobar.You gonna plant the g*n you're looking for, or just powder burns? Don't believe everything your father tells you.I don't have to tell you anything.My father told me that, too.You keep following his advice, and you'll end up just like him./ Ma! - Downstairs is clean.- You won't find anything.Taye has his father's mouth, but my husband and I raised him right.You got a lot of new books.History of Cuba.Cuba Today.My final essay on parts of the world where police don't practice racism.Definitely his father's mouth.Come on, Taye, let's let them do their work.This kid's inherited more than just his father's mouth.Dempsey does nothing by accident.Spanish, Cuba probably figure into their long-term plans.And k*lling Eduardo Escobar somehow gets them there.No.I never seen this man before.Eduardo had no enemies.He was gentle, always helping people.What about this one? You ever see him? No.Who are they? Just men.This is from Calabria, in the south of Italy.Did you go there for your honeymoon? No.Puerto Rico.We got married there.When did you go to Italy? I went last year.Well, Calabria's pretty rough country.People usually don't go there unless they have family - You don't have family there, do you? - No.So you went with somebody? It was before I met Eduardo.It's got nothing to do with this.Calabrese hardhead.Have you ever heard that expression? When I was a kid, I had a barber who was from Calabria.He told me that the people were very stubborn.He said that when you take something from them, they don't give up until they get it back.Who is he, Ms.Escobar? Tony.Tony Sirvino.He thinks that Eduardo stole me from him.- What does Mr.Sirvino do? - He works for the city.The Department of Correction? Yes.He drives their bus.An escape? / After Dempsey testifies for the grand jury tomorrow.Tony Sirvino's scheduled to drive his bus back to Rikers.Sirvino grew up in the South Bronx.He went to school with Dempsey, and Dempsey keeps tabs on his people.And he had his son k*ll Mr.Escobar as a favor to Mr.Sirvino? - This is - Brilliant.Once Dempsey got the contract from Milt to make these three hits, he orchestrated everything.The checks from the lawyer, the playing cards, everything, to lead us back to him, so we would bring him before the grand jury.He knew he'd be transferred from Greenhaven down to Rikers and driven back and forth to the courthouse.Sirvino helps them escape, and Dempsey's on his way to Cuba with his son.Beyond the reach of extradition.I suddenly have a newfound respect for Mr.Powers.- I ain't afraid of you.- Well, you should be afraid.Using your daddy's MO wasn't very smart.- Blood or no blood - Taye.- he's gonna take it out of your hide.- I'm Winston Malik, your father's lawyer.- Now I'm yours.- Or your mom's.But if you I ain't giving you no reason to k*ll my pops.Taye's invoking his rights.He doesn't have anything more to say.Unless his son cooperates, we have no case against Mr.Powers.And once Mr.Powers finds out we got wind to his escape plan, I doubt he'll testify to the grand jury tomorrow against Milt Winters, and then that case will be gone, too.We haven't told Junior what we know about the escape.We should be able to keep Powers in the dark until after he goes in front of the grand jury.But once we derail his escape, he'll never testify at Milt Winters' trial.We can use his grand jury testimony.Grand jury testimony is not admissible at trial.I need Mr.Powers to appear.I'm betting that Dempsey Powers I'm betting he knows that if he escapes to Cuba, his grand jury testimony can't be used at trial.He never intended to betray Milt.There is an exception, isn't there, that allows a grand jury testimony to be used at trial if the witness has been threatened into recanting his testimony? But who's going to thr*aten Dempsey Powers? His good friend Milt.Question."What did Mr.Winters tell you?" Answer from Mr.Powers."He was always complaining about all of them."His wife, his son, his lawyer." "He wanted to get rid of them." That's what your brother, Dempsey, told the grand jury just a little over an hour ago.- Down the street from here.- Question."Did Mr.Winters solicit your help in dealing with these individuals?" Answer from Mr.Powers."Yes." "He offered to pay me $50,000 each to get them k*lled." / Save your breath.Are you still convinced Mr.Powers is looking out for your interests? More than ever.This doesn't mean squat until he says it at my trial.And no way on earth he rats me out.My son, in a heartbeat, but Dempsey, never! I'm so curious about this unquestioning trust.Is it based on anything? Greenhaven.He looked out for me from day one.You paid for that protection.I was happy to share with him.He had so little.I had so much.The only thing that you had so much of in prison was fear.And Dempsey could smell it.And he used it to gain your trust.I'm not wrong about Dempsey.I know people.And Dempsey knows you.He told us that he was checking you out.He was looking for an in on you.And he found it in an article about a retailing miracle known as Winters Clothing.I I have it.It's here."Faced with his father's unexpected death, "not only kept the family store afloat, "but it turned into the flagship "of the city's most successful chain of men's clothing stores." There was a photo that was in the article.That's what tipped Dempsey off that you had help keeping the store afloat.Your dad's tailor, Morris Swope.Yeah, Uncle Morris.The man who looked out for you when your father d*ed, who showed you the ropes the first time that you were alone against the world.But Dempsey told us that he took one look at that photo and he knew.He knew how to come at you.And it wasn't by being a bully, or a flatterer, but as Morris Swope, the reassuring protector.Dempsey told us that it cracked him up.He pictured you sitting on his knee, like a wooden dummy.He got around your natural suspicion by modeling your one positive adult relationship.He took you for a couple hundred grand and sold you out for immunity and a few extra hours of TV every week.Sure, he's going to spend the rest of his days in relative comfort.But you? You're looking at the death penalty.I mean, that just doesn't seem fair.To be fair, Mr.Winters, I'll settle for life without parole in return for your admission of guilt.You think about it on your way back to Rikers.What's your name? Sirvino.You make these too tight, Sirvino, I'm gonna slap a brutality suit against you.- Milton! They got you.- I'm not sitting near this man.It's okay, Officer, we're old friends.Have a nice ride, gentlemen.The toughest guy in Greenhaven, a rat.Milton, be cool.Be cool.Cool? You spent the morning ratting me out.For what? More TV? That's what friendship's worth? Milt, don't worry, man, don't worry.It ain't gonna happen.I won't testify against you in court, okay? You already did.They playing you, Milton.Just chill out and trust me.Just chill.Sitting on your knee.Very funny, huh? What the hell are you talking about? I don't care what hole they put you in, Dempsey, I'm gonna reach out to you.You're a dead man.You're a dead man.What are you doing? You know what, Milt? I ain't going back to Haven.Just be cool.Be cool.- You're breaking out? - Shut up.Wait.Take Take me with you.We're a team, right? Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.Shut up./ Don't leave me.Dempsey, don't leave me.- Don't leave me behind.- It's a slice, Milton.Okay, okay, okay.Don't sh**t.Don't sh**t.Just put it down.Just put it down.It's empty.It's over.What the hell's going on? Tony Curtis speaks.I told you to keep your mouth shut, fool.We got Milt's death thr*at on tape.Which makes Mr.Powers' grand jury testimony admissible at Mr.Winters' trial.And we've got Mr.Powers for the Escobar k*lling.You know, it's a shame.All this trust and loyalty, look where it gets you.
02x17 - Cold ComfortQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:24In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.Who does she think this is going to fool? It's ridiculous.Maybe.But it contains all the necessary elements of a valid codicil.It's not even his signature.- I swear, Oliver, I am gonna - Jack.Come.How long now? Not long.Jack, the President's on the phone.Get the girls ready for bed.I'll be in later.Am I too late? No.Eloise, you're always just in time.Oliver showed me your so-called codicil.Everything's clear then.The only thing clear is how low you've sunk.It's okay, Daddy.I'm here.I've taken care of everything.We're gonna be together again.Daddy? What the hell's going on here? Where is my father? Your attorney can explain everything.My condolences.The Durning name is synonymous with singularity of vision through three generations.From my grandfather to my father to me.There are some in our family who would like to split the Durning Foundation into so many little fingers.But it is only as one that we remain a force for good.Just a minute.Yes? When? We'll get on it.I'm telling you all now that when the time comes, control of the Durning Foundation will pass to one man.To my son, Nicholas.Oh, I hope I haven't kept you waiting long.Oh, hi.No, I just got here myself.I'm just gonna run to the ladies' room.Okay? Okay.Hey, what are you doing? Law & Order CI Her friend said a woman followed her in here.No description, just a brown leather coat.Well, it's a single cut along the femoral artery.It's very precise, no hesitation marks.A pro.Her friend said that there was a purse.Well, it's not in here.She has soap on her hands.She She'd already come out of the stall, she was washing up.And the brown leather coat, after her purse, she followed her in the bathroom.Miss Kittridge went into the stall She hung her purse on the hook here.Leather coat would've just been able to reach over and grab it.No, I think Miss Kittridge probably just put it on the floor.No.She hung it up.Right.A girl thing.So the purse is on the hook within easy reach.But leather coat waited for her to leave the stall.This wasn't a robbery gone bad.It was a m*rder gone good.I called everyone on her emergency list.Her ex-husband's taking the first flight out tomorrow from Minneapolis.Who else is on the list? Her lawyer, Mr.Broome, a couple of friends.She having any problems with anybody, maybe legal problems? No, nothing like that.Because she has an entry in here for tomorrow afternoon.It's some kind of court hearing.Her father's only been dead for three days.It's too soon to contest the will.Eames.Tell them not to move anything.We'll be right there.And call the DA.You won't believe this.This restraining order bars an autopsy and entitles me to take custody of Miss Kittridge's body immediately.What did the DA say? To give the man what he wants.The remains aren't being destroyed.If a judge later rescinds the order, the body will be available for inspection.Where are they taking the body exactly? I am not at liberty to say.Sorry, let me give you a hand.I hope you guys are getting double time for hauling this corpse around in the middle of the night.Triple time.Good for you.Yeah.What do you got in there? Dry ice? Must be taking her on a hell of a road trip, huh? Just to JFK.And they got a private jet waiting.- Private jet? - Yeah.Man, even dead, these people go first class, huh? Yep.All right.Thanks.Three private flights left between 3:00 and 5:00 this morning.One for Mexico City, one for Seattle and one for Scottsdale, Arizona.Now, I'm betting that Miss Kittridge was on the one to Scottsdale.For the dry heat? No, for the freezing cold.Cryogenics.Scottsdale is the home of the largest storage facility in the world.It's why they packed her in dry ice.It's why her lawyer got a court order to prevent her autopsy.So she'll have all her fingers and toes when George Jetson defrosts her in the future.Maybe by then we'll be able to tell her who k*lled her.Yeah, or who had her k*lled.That hearing in Surrogate's Court this afternoon, it's Kittridge v.Kittridge.I can think of two Kittridges who won't be there.Who does that leave? My father told me of his wish to be interred at Arlington.We discussed the kind of ceremony, who would attend.Your Honor, the Senator's wish was that he be placed in suspended animation, so that he could be reunited with his daughter at some point in the future.He never even mentioned cryogenics to me.Even the Senator's will stated that he wanted to be interred at Arlington.Your Honor, that will was superseded by the codicil Miss Kittridge presented to the court.Much as I loved my sister, it is clear that she was exploiting my father's frailty.He wasn't at the signing.My client was.Since she's not here to authenticate it, I must rely on the will of record.Therefore, I order that Randolph Kittridge's body is to be disposed of as stipulated in the will, and that it be released into custody to his son, Jack Kittridge, for that purpose.We're adjourned.Thank you.Mr.Kittridge, I'm Detective Eames, this is Detective Goren.We're investigating your sister's m*rder.Oh, yes.I got your messages.It's okay.I appreciate everything that you're doing.Do you mind telling us what just went on in here? Yeah, we just settled a minor dispute over the disposal of my father's remains.Your sister is gonna have a rude awakening.She's expecting your father to be there waiting for her when she gets brought back to life.Eloise and I had different views about what was appropriate.You mean, like, dipping your old man in a vat of liquid nitrogen.That probably wouldn't be appropriate, especially if you're running a senate campaign.I guess people might think that you're from a family of fruitcakes.Well, it never came to that.It could've.Eloise had the codicil.If she were here she could've authenticated it.Oh, but she's not, is she? I hope that you find the people who k*lled my sister.Anything I can do, let me know.Good luck.Human Tissue Human Tissue Those are the originals.There are no copies.You people are clear on my terms? Crystal.Let me ask you, the other material, you never told me why you wanted it.No, we didn't.Please accept my condolences on the death of your sister.The storage facility said the sister made arrangements a year ago to have herself and her dad frozen.But Jack Kittridge didn't start litigating to stop her until last month.If you're worried about bad publicity, what could be worse than a court fight with your sister over your old man's corpse? Well, he might have something else to worry about besides publicity.The will said his father wanted to be interred.I just talked to Arlington.Jack arranged for his father to be interred all right, but not in the cemetery, in the crypt.The crypt? He's having him cremated.He had, as of an hour ago.Nothing like a 2,000 degree fire to destroy evidence.Randolph d*ed of lymphoma.He fought the cancer for three years.We thought he'd b*at it, then I found a malignant polyp in his colon.Was he a candidate for a bone marrow transplant? Well, yes.We were looking for a donor.- The kids weren't a match? - Well, Eloise wasn't.- Jack was never tested.- Afraid of needles? I have no idea.He did make several appointments, though.But he was always too busy, because of the needles.Thank you, Doctor.Well, that leaves the other option.He was always too busy to get tested because he might not really be a Kittridge.I hear skeletons in the family closet.You were assigned to protect the Senator back around the time his son was born? Around then, yes.Well, the Senator, he campaigned for LBJ's Civil Rights Act, and there were death threats against him and his family.Mr.Monahan, this is from the Senator's archives.The Secret Service agent at the door here, holding it for the Senator's wife and little Eloise, is that you? Looks like it.So they were your primary assignment when the Senator would go away to Washington? Yes, Mrs.K stayed up in Bedford with Eloise.She have any friends? Any special friends who visited her up there in Bedford? Special friends she didn't want her husband to know about.Mrs.K.loved the Senator very much.Sure.But you see, she was up there in Bedford all alone for weeks at a time, and then her son was conceived.I'm not getting into gossip.You were reassigned just before Jack was born.Yeah, I was bored.I wanted to be in DC where the action was.A different kind of action.Mr.Monahan, this old picture isn't a very good likeness of you.Now that I see you in person, your chin Jack.Jack has your chin.I've gotta get to the store.Mr.Monahan, we think Jack was afraid somebody might find out the Senator wasn't his biological father.That's why he had him cremated.No one knew.Not even the Senator.No one.Has your car been broken into recently? 'Cause this tint here is less faded than the other glass.Has this glass been replaced recently? Yeah, about a month ago.Some neighborhood punks, they smashed the window.What did they steal? Nothing really.The change in the ashtray.- I see you have lip balm there.- Yeah.They take that, too? Well, the one I had in there was missing.But I doubt that they stole it.I mean, a used stick of lip balm? Well, if it wasn't used, there'd be no point in stealing it.Every time you put lip balm on your lips, you leave dry skin cells on the stick.That's what they were after, to get Monahan's DNA to show that he was Jack's biological father.Jack got wind his secret's out.So he had the Senator's remains cremated.But by then, it's too late.The proof's already out there.Two weeks after Monahan's car got broken into, Jack filed suit to keep Eloise from freezing her father.They used the DNA to blackmail Jack into filing a suit.Somebody didn't want that body preserved.Or, they wanted something from the body.Something a reanimated Senator Kittridge couldn't live without, you know, 100 years from now.They brought Mr.Kittridge here right after he d*ed and we cooled him down to 5 degrees Celsius.They wanted him shipped to a cryogenic facility, but there was a legal hang-up and we ended up sending him to a crematorium.After you prepared him for cremation? Not me.The family brought in their own pathologist out of concern for Mr.Kittridge's dignity, which I totally get.Do you remember what the instruments looked like that the pathologist used? I saw him set up.He had scalpels, and retractors, and a few instruments I'm not familiar with.Well, you'd remember what they looked like.I mean, you could sketch them.We can work over here.Put it on the plane to Geneva.The lab will be up and running by tomorrow morning.Sorry for the interruption.No, your son was just telling us about your vaccine program in Africa.That was all Nick's idea.So have you decided what you're doing today? Yes, I'm gonna take my parents up to Connecticut for the night, show them the house.My grandfather used to take me fishing up there, to a little lake just outside of Outside - Outside - Litchfield.Katie says there's a room that would be perfect for a nursery.Fantastic.Nick and Katie, your engagement has made an old man happy.Extremely happy.Welcome to the family, all of you.Stryker saw.A bone mallet.This one is a malleable retractor.All this to remove a penile implant.Imagine what it took to put it in.They weren't removing an implant."Using a stryker saw to cut through the calva" It's the top half of the skull."the skull cap can be pried loose by twisting a t-shaped chisel "along the saw cut and tapping it gently with a bone mallet." They cut open his skull? "If the dura membrane is tightly adhered, "a malleable retractor will separate it from the brain." Don't tell me they took his brain.There's nothing in Kittridge's file about any neurological disorders.Nothing that would make his brain worth studying.A politician's brain? Maybe they wanted to see how he talked out of both sides of his mouth.Well, is there anything unique about brain cell DNA? Nah.It's all the same DNA from head to toe.They could have used hair or blood.But they didn't.Something has to be remarkable about that brain, enough to interest someone with the will and the resources to blackmail Jack Kittridge and k*ll his sister.It's gotta be for research.Well, they'd need a university-grade lab, at the very least.The Senator's doctor removed a polyp from his colon.- They did a biopsy.Do you - Yeah.Six months ago.At the York Institute.Senator Kittridge's polyp was used in a study on the genetics of neurological disorders.Well, his medical file doesn't mention he had a neurological disorder.Well, he didn't.The study collected tissue from all their patients, to look for chromosomal anomalies known to cause a whole host of disorders.Any anomalies on Senator Kittridge? Oh, I'm afraid that's confidential.Well, we'll just read the published paper.There was no paper.The study was terminated.The funding ran out.We'll guess the funding "ran out" when somebody pulled the plug.Maybe because of some negligence by the hospital? There was nothing we could've done to protect ourselves.Against what? Three months ago, someone hacked into our computer and retrieved personal data on the tissue donors.- Matching names and tissue samples? - Yes.After the security breach, the Durning Foundation pulled out.They funded the study? Yes.They threatened to sue.They even sent their own people here to destroy the data we'd collected.Spencer Durning himself called me.I was shocked.We fund over 800 projects a year.There are equally deserving programs that are more competently run.Senator Kittridge would be disappointed his polyp didn't get to save mankind from some terrible disease.It was part of the study.Did you know that? No, I didn't.How would I? Well, you wouldn't.It's a, well, you know, funny coincidence.Your foundation prepared a report on cryogenics for the Senator's son.It was Exhibit "L" in his suit against his sister.The Foundation had studies on the subject.Jack Kittridge's lawyer approached us for help.Randolph Kittridge was a great American.He deserves better than to spend eternity hanging by his ankles in a tub of nitrogen.Come on.It was an act of love by his daughter.I mean, what if your son - Your son - Yes, Nicholas.What if your son Nicholas, preserved your body for the day where they came up with a cure for, well, whatever k*lled you.Cryogenics is pie-in-the-sky science.My son knows better.I mean, you'd be worth bringing back.I don't plan on dying.Maybe it would've been a greater act of love to donate the Senator's body to science.Especially if there was something unique about him.Something that came out during the research at the York Institute.Is that why you helped Jack Kittridge? Mr.Durning already answered that question.He said that the Senator was a great American.I mean, you can't really believe that, I mean, for a minute, can you? I mean, don't get me started on politics.It's I mean, you know, his marriage was the great American joke.He cheated on his wife, his wife cheated on him I meant his public life.His service to the country.He wimped out on the country.Ran for presidency in '76, dropped out before the first primary.I mean, there were rumors of dr*gs and Oh, no, that was ridiculous.No.No, I saw it on TV.He started crying right in the middle of one of his press conferences.The guy couldn't get though one speech without losing his place.He always forgot facts.I mean, it's like, the guy didn't, you know, know where he was.You know, half the time.As I remember, he was suffering from exhaustion and he needed a rest.We've faced an unrelenting barrage of slurs.My wife Maureen, and my children Eloise and Jack, don't deserve this.It's not worth it.So I am withdrawing my name as a candidate for the presidency of the United States.Here's another one from the Boston Herald in January '76."Kittridge wandered off the stage in the middle of a fundraiser."His wife said he had the flu." Must have been some flu.Senator, do you support the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v.Wade? If elected, I will uphold the law of the land.If elected, I will uphold the law of the land.It's been a long day.Our children are waiting for us.Thank you.I remember this puppet show.Everybody thought he was stoned.Well, his eyes aren't glassy, his speech isn't slurred.But he is completely disoriented.There's nothing in his record, not even a DUl.And no hint of a substance abuse problem in his files or of a nervous breakdown.Kittridge had unprovoked mood swings, he had memory losses, he neglected his appearance.His lapses, they took place late in the day and they got worse over a period of months.You're describing my old man.Except he has Alzheimer's.Well, maybe Kittridge did, too, in '76.But he was only what? 40, 42? There's a rare form of the disease, it's called early-onset Alzheimer's.It's genetically-transmitted, strikes people in their 30s and 40s.Except a year later, Kittridge went back to the senate, and he was sharp as a tack until he resigned eight years ago.And as far as I know there's no cure for Alzheimer's.There isn't.Somehow, Kittridge recovered.And that would make him some kind of medical miracle.And his brain worth studying.Well, it would account for all the bad behavior if someone desperate enough thought that it held a key to a cure.I'm sorry for interrupting, but he keeps trying to run outside.He says he's late for school.His afternoon pills are still here.He forgot to take them.He forgot? That's what he does.He forgets.It's your job to remember.Come on.Let's go to bed.But I'm gonna miss the bus.I'm gonna be late for school.No, it's not time to go to school, Nicky.It's time for good little boys to be in bed.Now we're gonna take our vitamins.Take a big gulp.That's my boy.Everything's gonna be fine, Nicky.Everything's gonna be fine.Alzheimer's? But he held office.He chaired committees.He recovered.Against all odds, against conventional medical wisdom.Certain people found out.For their own reasons, they wanted to study your father's brain, so they blackmailed you to get access to his remains.Well, that's absurd.Blackmail about what? We know about your mother's indiscretion.Who got to you, Jack? Spencer Durning? He's ruthless enough to k*ll to get what he wants.Your sister.They didn't tell you? You wanna see what a neat surgical job they did on her? Don't even consider stonewalling to save your campaign.We have enough to indict.This is just a courtesy.It's a complete fabrication.There isn't a grain of truth to these allegations.Consider your bluff called.Maybe it's you who's wrong about Mr.Durning.Why would a man like him use such desperate measures to steal an organ? Because he is desperate to save his only child, his son Nicholas.He is the right age for the onset of the disease.Then why all the secrecy? They don't want anyone to find out.For the last four years, he's been fighting with relatives to keep them from carving up the family foundation.Now, he's been able to fend them off by naming his son as the sole successor.Which wouldn't do him any good if everybody found out his heir apparent had Alzheimer's.He can't hide it for long.Maybe he won't have to.Nicholas had a shipmate.Nick didn't tell me he gave his dad that photo.It was taken last summer off Block Island.On your brother's boat.That's how we found you.Don't worry.Your brother didn't tell us that you and Nick were engaged.We found that out on our own.Why else would his dad keep your picture on his desk? Maybe I should call Mr.Durning.Must be intimidating marrying into a rich family with all their, well, rules and secrecy.Is Nick in trouble? Would you be surprised if he was? Nick's a very honest person.Well, you wouldn't marry him if he weren't or have kids with him.You do plan on having kids with him, right? - We both want children.- Well, that's great.And you live in different cities.How's that working out for you? Nick flies me to New York every week or so to spend the day.Meaning, in theIn the daytime.What do you do in the evenings? Nick gets very tired in the evening.He has a medical condition.Cerebral aneurysm.It's not life-threatening.Is that what he told you, he had an aneurysm? Yes.He'll probably have surgery after the wedding.The ME said if he had an aneurysm, he'd have headaches, dizziness, not just fatigue.That's why he doesn't see her in the evenings, 'cause in the early stages of Alzheimer's, that's when the symptoms appear.He lied to her.Or he did tell her he has Alzheimer's and she's keeping the secret.The disease is inherited.Nick could pass it to their kids.I can't imagine any woman having children under those circumstances.So Spencer Durning and his son are deceiving this poor woman just to produce an heir? No.A spare.If they can't find a cure for Nicholas, Durning will use this grandchild to retain the control over the Foundation.That would be detestable.And so far, unprovable.Will a show-and-tell help? It's our turn to call a bluff.If I haven't committed any crime, why am I under arrest? You'll have to ask the DA.He's the one who got the material witness warrant.Oh, I'm a witness? To what? Ask the DA.He just wants to make sure you show up to testify.Once you post bail, you can go home.- When do I see a judge? - Sometime tonight.Wheels of justice.This is incredible.Can I at least make a phone call? Your dad's already been contacted.We can contact your fiancee, if you want us to.Tell her that you're okay.You know, just give us her number.You already have the number.She told me you went to Providence to talk to her.You're not worried, given your condition? Your aneurysm.Katie told us that you got tired.The judge will ask you questions, you'll have to answer them.Yeah, so I'll answer them.Look, I won't be at my best, but so what? So they know I have an aneurysm.The doctors that diagnosed you, they work for the Durning Foundation? Yes.Anyway, I take medication.I have it with me.It's in my briefcase.There's no problem.If he has Alzheimer's, the symptoms will show up by the time he appears at the hearing.If he's worried about people finding out, he doesn't look it.Maybe because he has an aneurysm.Where's my son? I wanna see him now.Let me handle it, Spencer.Then handle it.Get him out.I wanna see this material witness order.If you wanna challenge it, you can file a writ.I want my son home within the hour.That's not gonna happen, Mr.Durning.But for sure by this evening, at the earliest.What the hell are you waiting for? File the damn writ.I am not leaving without my son.Why don't we wait in my office, Mr.Durning.Now, that's a man who's worried and looks it.Hmm.Let's get Nick into interrogation.Where is he? Why do you have him in there? Where we had him was noisy and busy.This is more quiet, less stressful.Wouldn't want him to get stressed out on account of his aneurysm.He told us all about it.You know you can't talk to him without his lawyer.On the contrary, he's a witness, not a suspect.Nick is looking a little peaked.I got him something to eat.That'll perk him up.Oh! And the meds.One or the other ought to do the trick.I have to talk to my son.I insist on talking to him.Can't allow that.But you can listen in.How are you holding up? I'm a little tired, but I'll be okay.I brought your pills.I mean, you can't take them yet.There's a protocol that we have to follow just so that we know that they're exactly what you say that they are.And I'll just look it up.I mean, you wouldn't believe the things that people try and pull on us."Dexamethasone." Yeah, it's an anti-inflammatory.Right."Dexamethasone, anti-inflammatory, for the treatment of cerebral aneurysm." Well, what's wrong? Well, you can see in the book here that That it showsIt has pictures of exactly what the pill is, but And your pill doesn't look anything like the one in the book.You can see that the one in the book is blue, and yours is yellow.Yes, I don't understand.Well, that's two of us.Who fills your prescriptions? I get them through my doctors' office.The doctors who work for your father's foundation.Yes.I'll be right back.Well, you just keep looking through the book.How long do you think it's gonna take him to find out that the pills your doctors are giving him aren't for an aneurysm? You don't know what you're talking about.If anything happens to my son because you denied him his medications Yeah, I think he just found one.I've gotta get in there.I have to talk to him.Dad.Nick, you're gonna be all right.Tom's working to get you out.You'll be home soon, you can rest.Never mind what they say.You can take your medications.No, but there's something wrong with it.There's a mix-up.We'll sort that out later.Did you find that pill in there? Yes.It's lorazepam.It's an anti-anxiety drug.Are you sure? Why would they prescribe that? Maybe you should look up those other pills.No, this is a waste of time.Now just give me the book.Dad, Dad, why are you being like this? I think he has a right to know what dr*gs he's taking.Here, the dexamethasone.Nick, these people are not your friends.I can see why you picked him as your successor.What? Well, his spirit.He knows his own mind.If not him, then one of those grandkids you're dying to get your hands on.Did you find something, Nick? Well, this Well, this can't be right.What does it say? It's a drug called donezepil.It's It's for people with Alzheimer's.I'm sure it has many other uses.No.It just says Alzheimer's.This is idiotic.Why don't we wait until we can consult with the doctors? Now, it makes sense.They prescribe anti-anxiety pills to people with Alzheimer's.Why are they giving me these dr*gs? Maybe you should tell him.I have Alzheimer's? A rare form called early-onset Alzheimer's.How long have you known? I'd say six to eight months.He's been keeping it under wraps, so no one will know that the future of the Durning Foundation was in the hands of someone whose mind is slowly slipping away.I had a right to know.Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Because then he wouldn't get the grandkids that he's counting on taking your place.See, Nick, your disease, it's inherited.And you, you have a conscience.Now, you wouldn't wanna play Russian roulette with the future of your kids.But your father, he would.He'd sacrifice them, your fiancee, you on the altar of his grandiosity.That's a lie.There's hope, Nick.There are precedents.I am moving heaven and earth to find a treatment.We're a year or two, maybe even months away.He's right.He's right about that one thing.There is a precedent.Senator Randolph Kittridge, he got Alzheimer's when he was 42 and he b*at it.He went on to have a brilliant career.- But it was a fluke.- No.It was an aberration with no scientific value.No, no, no.We can learn from that case.He's already written you off.Go to hell! Listen to me, Nick.My team is on the verge of isolating the mechanism in his brain that produced high levels of the APoE2 protein.That's the key.You found high levels of E2 in Kittridge's brain? Yes! Yes! I guess all that blackmail and m*rder is paying off after all.Kittridge's daughter had other plans for her father's brain.So your dad had her k*lled.Don't you dare look at me like that! You know where you got that disease! Those weak genes from your mother.I had to fix what she did to you.And if I did anything wrong, damn it, I did it for you, for your future! His future? Your future! You don't plan on dying, remember? You wanna be immortal.You got to be immortal.And not in a tub of nitrogen.No, your vessel to eternity is the Durning Foundation.To carry your legacy burning bright through the centuries.No, it's not enough for you to be humanitarian of the year.You got to be humanitarian of the millennium.Shame on you.Humanitarian to everything and everyone, except your son.Your son's tragedy.Because, Spence, however much you may like humanity, it's people that you can't stand.Spencer Durning, you're under arrest for m*rder.Worst thing that can happen to a man that wants to be remembered? What's that? In a year or two, his own son won't know who he is.
02x18 - LegionQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/19/23 20:25In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.- Hey.- Hey.It's freezing in here.They didn't fix the heat? Mmm-mmm.Called the super this morning.Calling doesn't do any good.I'll go down and talk to him.Hey, where's Sami? Did you let him go out? He doesn't do what I tell him.You let him bring that in here? Rico, don't make trouble, please! If he comes in here, I'll send him straight home.Okay.Hey, hey! Where's Sami, huh? I don't know anything.You don't know.Then why you running, huh? - I don't know! - Where you going off in a rush? You don't know? Listen, you tell your friends Sami's out of this.If he isn't home in una hora, I'm gonna call the cops and let them know what you're up to.- Listen, I don't know - Listen, you tell your friends what I said! Hey.Hey, get away from me! Help! We heard you were looking for Sami.You got your pops to thank for this, little man.Look at him, little man.Look at the love in his eyes.He loves you so much.Welcome death, little man.Look, the senator's bill's never gonna make it out of committee.No, it's dead, gone, forget it.Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I didn't see him.I didn't see him.He came out of nowhere.I didn't even see him.Oh, my God.Law & Order CI Witnesses confirm the initial report.This guy ran out into traffic.This accident finished something someone else started.His throat's been cut.It's not very deep.Didn't go through the carotid artery.There's dirt in the wound, in his mouth.He's even aspirated some up his nose.And there's dirt under the nails.This man was buried alive.He He dug himself out.This blood spatter on his pants, you see how it moves across both legs? It didn't come from his neck.I didn't see any other wounds.There's another injured out there.Out there, somewhere in Prospect Park.Guys, we're gonna have to check this whole perimeter.Oh, damn.This is Detective Eames.We have a body.Male, juvenile, about 50 yards in from the playground.He was cut right through the carotid.The boy d*ed instantly.And there's no mistake this time.We ran the prints.We got a pop on the adult victim.Enrique lberra.According to the blood tests, the kid's probably his.I'm guessing lberra's priors were for dope.This MO's got dope written all over it.Iberra's last conviction was 12 years ago.He finished his GED while he was inside.His parole reviews are stellar.He had car grease on his jacket, calluses on his hand.He was a mechanic.He was working for a living.He and his kid were what, witnesses? Wrong place, wrong time? Or it's punitive.Someone was being taught a lesson.The father? Not necessarily.Iberra had his son's blood on his pants.His son was buried on top of him.Which means Iberra was likely k*lled first.Right in front of his son.Was your husband in any kind of trouble? Did he owe someone money or No.There was no trouble.Not about Sami? No.No.When Sami didn't come home last night, you weren't worried? I thought he was with Rico.And Rico came home after work, he left his toolbox there and then he left again.Why? To have a beer.But Sami was 12 years old.He didn't take Sami to have a beer.No.Sami, he was with his friends, kids from the neighborhood.Maybe your husband went out looking for him.No.He just went out That's all, he ju I'm just so upset.I'm sorry.We're gonna have to look in Sami's room.Sami was a fan.Him and his friends, they all wanna be basketball players.Your husband took him to the games? No, we can't afford that.These are ticket stubs from three different games.The last one was a month ago.Someone from Rico's work got him those.A rich guy.Rico worked on his car.I don't remember his name.These protein bars, did you buy them? Sure, I did.How much did they cost? I A dollar something.I don't remember.These are worth about $5, right? I mean, these are about five bucks.Did someone give them to Sami? Maybe the same person who gave him the game tickets.No, I told you.I can't help you.Please.We think you need our help.Promise you'll give us a call, okay? Did Sami work on cars with his dad? I'm wondering if this stuff's grease or oil here.See? Rico's work.Grease everywhere in the house./ It's okay, I'll clean it up.It's no big deal.You should really listen to what my partner is telling you.You're not alone.Protein bars, Knicks tickets, this kid had expensive tastes.Yeah, and the money to indulge them.Move it over to the right, okay, because that's where the drum kit goes.Where you been? We got a booking in 20 minutes.Yeah, sorry, Jojo.- You know I count on you, right? - Yeah.And after, Tomas needs help with his homework.What? You know the rules.You wanna hang out, eat my food, learn the board, then you gotta get the homework done.Frankie.You create a problem, solve it on your own time.Let's go.Dead? Both of them? I didn't know.Enrique's wife said you saw him last night.Why would she say that? Maybe because he said he was having a beer with you.No way he told her that.I was still here, right here, working till 9:00.How do you know it was before 9:00 when he went out? Well, you just said that She didn't tell you what time it was, Mr.Ramirez.Now you know because you saw him, right? Maybe somebody told me they saw him.Somebody who? Somebody from where Enrique was having the beer, like Louisa said.Where would that be, you being Enrique's drinking buddy? Try la taverna around the corner.Hey, I wasn't that close to him.He'd been in jail, you know? See that bodega down there on the right? I think the guy there, Ramirez, was friends with him.Maybe he saw him.But you're sure Mr.Iberra didn't come in for a beer last night? Yeah.He hardly ever came in.I don't know, maybe once, I don't know.I never noticed him.Sorry.Honest people, every last one of them.You can tell 'cause they're such bad liars.Hey, guys.Hey, no, no, wait up, wait up.Listen, me and my partner, we need your help.Did you know that a friend of yours from the neighborhood, Sami Iberra, you know that he got k*lled last night with his We don't know him.- We don't know what happened.- Wait, wait, wait.I'm not finished.Who put the word out not to talk to us? Who's everyone afraid of? Come on, Sami grew up here all his life with his mom and his dad.Huh? You guys grew up with him.You probably went to the same school, right? You played video games, you sh**t hoops.You don't think you should stand up for him? In this neighborhood, the Neighborhood Watch watches the cops.It just breaks my heart.Sami was one of our small victories.He worked so hard to better his grades.This year it all just clicked in for him.How was he outside of class? Any problems with the other kids? Fights? No.He stuck mostly with kids from his own neighborhood.They're all good kids.That's the picture we're getting.The local precinct said it's a low crime area, very little drug activity.Protein bars seem to be the drug of choice.All of Sami's friends eat those.If you had to name Sami's best friend, who would that be? It was Jamal Dupuis, but Jamal moved out of state a few months ago to live with his father.How did Sami take that? He started acting out, but he got himself under control.CD player.Noise reduction headphones.It's got to be at least a couple hundred bucks.That's Rap.Rap.Well, this is interesting.What is that, a mambo? No, it's son.It's music from Cuba.Which is odd 'cause his family's Dominican.These kids are usually ferocious about, you know, embracing their ethnic background.It's homemade.Sami's Mix.And he didn't have a computer or a CD burner at home.Sixteen-One Studios.Yeah, I showed Sami how to download tracks and use the CD burner.You a friend of the family? A friend of the community.The local kids, they like to stop by after school, I let them hang out till their parents come home from work.But that can't be good for business.Hey, don't worry.When J.Lo comes in, I make sure the kids behave.Let me help you with that.We'll move it around this way.All right.You know, Sami's He had a very eclectic selection on his CD.Yeah, rap, hip-hop, you'd expect that.But son music? Is that your influence, Mr.Rios? He heard me play it.He liked it.Kids are like, you know, sponges.He see you eat these? He had some in his locker at school.Well, I can't help it if they get hungry, and I don't feed them junk.I mean, you eat junk, you become junk.Yeah, respect your body, respect yourself.That's a good philosophy.I'm sorry, this thing is just so Baby! Oh, I like that.It records a word or a phrase so you can play it like a note, you know.You let the kids use this stuff? I teach them how to use the equipment, after they do their homework.Jojo's clubhouse.All due respect, ma'am, where would you like these boys to be? Here, doing their schoolwork, maybe learning a skill, or out in your neighborhood boosting car stereos? No, here, definitely.Hey, Frankie, Ruthie's Jerk Palace is coming in at 4:00, huh? You want to set up the board? I got a restaurant commercial to do.You must do a lot of these commercials to pay for all this gear.Oh, commercials, demos.I even got a couple of clients get on the Latin charts.Is Frankie one of your success stories? Frankie's like an apprentice, you know? Another couple of years, he'll know enough to open his own studio.So he gets his own studio, and then there's Sami.What happened with him? He was a victim of his father's impulses.The man was an ex-convict.That was his nature.He was probably mixed up with some bad people, and the poor kid paid the price.You know, one last thing, before we let you get on with your, you know, commercial.Jamal Dupuis, did he hang out here with Sami? Yeah, for a while.But I think the kid moved out of the neighborhood.Good.That's that's what we heard.Well, thanks.Baby! I really like I really like that.Jamal moved down to the barrier islands, to live with his father in South Carolina.Why? Was he having problems here? He wanted to work, and they don't let 13-year-olds work up here.So, they say you can make good money crabbing down there.Have you talked to him lately? He calls from time to time from pay phones.His father doesn't have a phone now.Have you told him what happened to his friend Sami? No.Well, they were best friends.They hung out together at the sound studio on Bergen Street.We have nothing to say against Mr.Rios.Your daughter is very cute.You're happy Jamal's out of the house.Why would you say that? Well, you don't have any photos of him.What's the town where Jamal's staying with his father? It's not just one town.Well, his father's got family on a lot of the islands down there, so Jamal stays with them, too.My favorite place down there is Gullah Gullah Island.I bet Jamal probably goes crabbing there.Oh, yes.I remember him telling me that.Telling you that he went crabbing on Gullah Gullah Island? You know, Mrs.Dupuis, there is no island with that name.Well, I'm sure I heard of it.That's because there's a children's television show called Gullah, Gullah Island, and you probably watched it with him when he was growing up.Where is he? What happened to him? He's with his father, and you have to go now.Mr.Dupuis, we can protect your family.Just go.Slowly, now.You don't need that much, just half.Easy, easy.You see, Ramon? One drop at a time, not all at once like you did last week.- No, I didn't.- Don't contradict! A man who sees his own shortcomings and corrects them is on his way to meet God.Frankie, come help teach these boys.Your mind isn't here.You wanna be strong, you stay focused.You watch Bennie.He's focused.That's how he gets the job done.I got the job done, Jojo.Half done.Now I told you, watch Bennie.You see, Frankie? That's focus.Jamal's parents were supposed to contact us to tell us where to send his school records, but we never heard from them.Jamal ever talk about working in South Carolina? No, I never heard that.Could we see other files from students who moved away in the last year or so? Sure.We keep them over here.There's a notation in Jamal's records from the school nurse.Two weeks before he moved, he showed up with a black eye and a broken collar bone.Here you go.This one moved to Fresno, California.The school board confirms he's enrolled there.Here, Christopher White, broken arm six months ago.Three weeks later, his parents say he moved to Oklahoma to live with relatives.There's no confirmation in the file.We try to stay on top of things.Marco Reyes.His parents say they sent him to Mexico to live with his grandmother.That was a week after he showed up for class with eight stitches in his face.These kids were all getting a b*ating as a going-away present.Well, they have something else in common.They were all from the same 12-block radius.The same 12 scared blocks.Some kids were trolling for scrap metal last October along l-95 near exit 43.Their dog started digging.John Doe, 12 to 13 years old.He matches one of the set of dental records you sent around.Christopher White.The throat was cut.The laceration was deep, all the way back to the vertebra.Almost took his head clean off.The way the body was posed in the grave, stretched out, hands crossed over the front, feet together.A proper burial.A sign of respect? I'm looking at Christopher White's birth certificate.His body was dumped less than a mile from where he was born.And these spots on the shoe, anyone test them? Other than coloring and tanning agents, all you got here is shoe leather.No trace of anything that would cause it to cr*ck and discolor like that.Yeap.You know, when I was a kid, I had leather mitts, all right, and then they would get cracked, you know, when they were wet and cold.Well, that's how leather reacts when it's frozen.What about flash frozen? Sure, with dry ice.But that leaves a residue.Liquid nitrogen? Sure.It evaporates, leaves no residue.Look, I was wondering if you could run this through your machine.I wiped it off the floor of a kid's bedroom.Is that grease? You tell me.Submicron Teflon chips.Graphite.Rare polymers.Friction modifiers.I'm afraid to ask you where you put this kind of grease.It's Italian racing bicycle grease.It's $30 a tube.I can imagine what the bicycles cost.Up to $15,000.If the lberra kid had a bike like this in his bedroom, it had to be stolen.That's what he was into.Yeah, that's what they're all into.The kid in New Jersey, he dripped liquid nitrogen on his shoe.Liquid nitrogen is used to break bicycle locks.I pulled some figures from Compstat.There are $3 million worth of bicycles stolen in all five boroughs every year.Most of it involves adult perps, but there are reports of one g*ng of kids operating in Manhattan.They're quick, they use different MO's and they've never been caught.And they're all well-trained.Like Jojo said, kids are like sponges.And I assume the ones that don't make the grade or make trouble get their throats cut.We matched up three of the missing boys, including Jamal Dupuis, with John Doe remains.Their parents have been contacted, but they're still not talking.Let's be careful how much we lean on them.According to the direction of the marks on the vertebrae, these kids had their throats slit from behind from left to right.The k*ller was right-handed.But Sami Iberra and his father had their throat cut from right to left.Their k*ller was left-handed.Jojo was breaking in someone new? Somebody who didn't quite do the job right.That's a Cielo with a set of Record 10 shifters.Bennie got that.Good work, Bennie.Real good work.You know what? You guys go home, okay? - Frankie and I can take it from here.- They could help unload.You don't look good.You eat lunch? I just haven't been sleeping so good, that's all.I heard what the cops found.I know.But you're standing up good.Your loyalty, that's what's appreciated.Thanks, Jojo."The power within stays safe and free from as*ault, "superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly." - You remember that? - I do.I know you do.And I know you're gonna continue standing by everyone.Your fellow warriors.Any sacrifice that's needed.That's what I know you can do.Well, what do you mean? If it's necessary, we know you'll do, what a man would do."Don't act as if you're going to live 10,000 years."Death hangs over you." "While you live, while it's in your power, be good." Frankie's not home a lot of the time.Look, is there a reward for information or what? - A reward? - Hmm.Maybe we can scrounge something up.What do you think? Twenty bucks.We can handle 20 bucks.Twenty bucks? Well, it's not like he's on the FBI's top 10 list.Well, I can see Frankie's mom has kept her youthful looks.Don't run, Frankie.It won't be good for you if you run.- I'm not running.- What you go and do, you little jerk? Bringing the cops into my house after all I've done for you.I hope they fry you.That's a good attitude, Frank.And so it begins.Your dad's quite a ladies man, huh? When my dad came home at night, I could smell them on him.I was ashamed.Right? I mean, like your dad.I can see why you look up to Jojo.I really can."Everything has always been the same." How do you mean? "You can't lose another life than the one you're living now, or live another one than the one you're losing." "The longest life is the same as the shortest." What's he talking about? "The longest life is the same as the shortest." I know this."Some things are rushing into existence." "Others out of it." Did you read this, Frankie? "Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed "Glimpsed" "Glimpsed once, already carried past us and is gone." Yeah.That's Marcus Aurelius.The dictates of a warrior.Okay.Call EMS.He's taken something.He's trying to k*ll himself.This is unit 229.We have an attempted su1c1de.What did you take, Frankie? I am a warrior.I welcome death.Yes, and warriors try to live.They fight and they And they live.The son of a bitch! He told him to do it! He told him to! He's on a respirator.It's touch and go.He took some kind of cyanide.He must have been carrying it around with him.In case of capture? What, did this boy step out of an old w*r movie? An old Roman w*r movie.Before he went into convulsions, he was quoting Marcus Aurelius.Marcus Aurelius? The Meditations? He was a Roman emperor And a follower of the Roman Stoic philosophy.But I wasn't aware that Marcus Aurelius was an advocate of su1c1de.Well, he wasn't.But like any belief system in the wrong hands, Stoicism can be twisted to mean whatever you want.The wrong hands being Jojo Rios.His idea of self-control.The way that the bodies were laid out for the burial, where they were buried, he's following the playbook.Even the name of his sound studio, Sixteen-One.The year 161 AD, the year Marcus Aurelius was made emperor.Mr.Rios sees himself as a general? Leading 12-year-olds in a criminal enterprise with the help of a second century philosophy? Stoicism inspired the Roman legions to march across Europe and Africa.I mean, if you're gonna start a g*ng, you could pick a worse model.Detectives, I'm sorry.The Marino boy didn't make it.The doctor will be out to talk to you.I need to notify the next of kin.The father.Nurse, his father, he's not gonna care.We need a gag order.I mean, the hospital can put out that we brought Frank Marino in, but we don't want them to tell anyone that he's dead.We don't? No.If Frank Marino talked, we'd have a case against Jojo Rios.We need him to have talked.Excuse me, but I really do need to notify the parents.Nurse, I'm Ronald Carver, Assistant District Attorney.I need to explain something to you.It's time to round up some legionnaires.- Bennie, come on.- I'm moving.I'm moving.- Not anymore.- Uh-oh.Jojo takes care of us.No, see, that money he's making off the bicycles, he's not putting that in your college fund.He's gonna spend it while you sit in Spofford.Ramon, don't be a sucker! Your mom's all alone with your two little brothers.What are they gonna think if you go to jail? They'll see I'm a man.To stay true.That's what it means to be a man.Christopher White, Marcos Reyes, Jamal Dupuis and Sami lberra.What happened to them, Bennie? And why did Jojo have them k*lled? Listen, I do not know anything about that.What about Christopher White? He was in your class.He must have done something pretty bad to end up like this.What, was he weak? Disloyal? Did he steal from the others? Listen, he was a good person.He was a good person? Yeah.That's right.I forgot.You don't speak ill of the dead.You don't speak ill of a fellow warrior.Chris White was a fellow warrior.He's buried in New Jersey, the land of his birth because that's what Marcus Aurelius told you to do.You see, we know all about Jojo and Mr.Aurelius.Frankie told us.Did you know that he was arrested earlier? If that had happened, he'd know what to do.- He wouldn't just nark on Jojo.- Oh, no.No, he told us how him and Jojo laid Chris in his grave.No.Frankie's a hero, just like Jojo.He would never turn his back on us.Jojo's a hero? How do you figure that? He's a sound engineer.No, no.I know his story.Jojo came from Cuba.His boat sank, and it was night.Everybody drowned except for Jojo.He made it because he's strong.He taught us how to be strong.- To be true? - Yes.He showed you by example.You would never betray him because he would never betray you.- Yes.The way of the warrior.- The way of the warrior.Well, it's nice to see kids studying the classics.And learning all the wrong lessons.Well, should we pick up a few more of Mr.Rios' disciples? Well, there's no point.I mean, we can't thr*aten them with anything more potent than what they're already afraid of.Afraid of falling short, as warriors, as men, in the eyes of their hero.All that's missing is w*r paint and a bonfire.The wild place inside every boy's heart.You know, Jojo knows that Well, he knows that every good hero needs a good story.I need to call the INS.I was going out to see a client about a booking.- You're lucky you caught me.- We're lucky that way.Well, we won't be long.It's about Frank Marino.What did you call him? Your apprentice? / Yeah.Frankie's a good kid.I hope he's not in trouble.Afraid so.We think he's mixed up with a ring of bicycle thieves.That's hard to believe.Well, what's worst is that when we were questioning him, he did something, well, inexplicable.He took cyanide.My God, that's He k*lled himself? Well, no.He botched it.He's still alive.He's at Methodist Hospital.We should be able to talk to him by tomorrow.That's good.I'm glad he's gonna make it.He might not be so glad.He's facing a couple m*rder charges for Sami Iberra and his father, Enrique.Yeah, he botched that, too.Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he wasn't planning on Sami's father, you know, running out of the park with his throat slit.Look, I'd be surprised if Frankie had anything to do with that.But then again, I don't really know what he does on his own time.Well, what he does is, I mean, you know, besides heisting bikes and - k*lling people - On his own time.- Do you mind? - Sorry.- That's expensive equipment.- Sure, sure.So sorry.What he does is he fills his mind with some kind of, you know, martial philosophy about warriors and loyalty, accepting death.That's what he talked about on the way to the hospital.You don't know anything about that? No.That's funny because we thought that it came from you, you know, along with the protein bars.I mean, even if I did believe all that stuff, these are hard-core street kids, you know? I mean, they wouldn't listen to a guy like me.Come on, you're being too modest.These kids look up to you.Where did you hear that from? Bennie Renato.He thinks you're a hero.That's crazy.You know, these are street kids.They're running a con on you.Well, no, I mean, Bennie, he seemed very sincere.Hey, he told us about your perilous crossing from Cuba.You know, your boat sank at night.Everyone drowned.I mean, except you.That's right.I told him that.So what? Why, because it's true, right? - Of course.- It was the Mariel boatlift.It was when Castro emptied his jails.You came over with your father.- Your father is a convicted r*pist.- That's a lie.Hey, not according to your INS file.Your boat, well, it didn't sink.And those people, nobody was lost at sea or The INS put your father in a detention center.They put you in a foster home and then in a group home until you were 17.Okay.Okay.- So I made up a story.- Well, not just any story.Well, it was, you know, a hero's story.I mean, you know, the child being plucked from the water.That's Moses with a little Jonah thrown in there.And then the orphan who grows up to be a great leader.That's Marcus Aurelius.You know what? I don't know what you're talking about.No? Marcus Aurelius.That warrior's creed? That loyalty unto death stuff? - You taught them that.- No.Look, I was new in the neighborhood.I had to make nice with the locals, so I let their kids hang out here.That's all.Oh, that's good for PR, I guess.I swear to God.And if I told them stories, Boy Scout crap, it was just talk.All that stuff about loyalty was just talk? Loyalty's fine as far as it goes, but if Frankie and Bennie did something illegal, that's not my responsibility.And if they're telling you something different, they're liars.So, you gave them some attention and a little advice and sent them on their way.That's all I did.And if they got into trouble, you know, themselves, they were on their own.I don't owe them a thing.Not even loyalty? Nothing.All right, Mr.Rios, I think we've wasted enough of your time talking about these punks.What are you doing? Did you take that CD out of there? - Hey man, the thing just popped out.- Yeah, the hell it did.You recorded me.You son of a bitch recorded me.- What's the big deal? It's not like - Now, you can't take that! That's my property, now you give it to me.What did you think you were gonna do with this, huh? I was gonna use it to see if any of the kids had illusions about how you felt about them.I told you, those dumb kids have got nothing to do with me.I'm surprised at you, Jojo.About what? Well, I mean, a guy like you on the cutting edge of sound recording technology, you know, thinking that we would resort to using a synthesizer to bug your sound studio.Especially when we have neat stuff like this.An omnidirectional microphone and transmitter all in one.You know, that broadcasts theater-quality sound through brick and soundproofing up to 100 yards away.You know, I can't believe you, Jojo.You know, I'm so stupid.What you think you heard, it was a trick.Listen, I heard, all right? So tell me, Jojo, what do we do now? To be true.What, do we be like Frankie? Tell me, what do we do to stay true? Yeah.I just want to tell them everything.Don't you dare! / Jojo Rios, you're under arrest for m*rder.No, no, no.Bennie, Bennie, Bennie! Listen to me.Listen to me! Listen.Listen, you're not stupid, Bennie.You're not stupid.You're a strong kid.You're a true kid.That book that you read about being a warrior, that was good.It's Jojo, man, he sent you on a battle that wasn't good.But you, you're true.And you're strong.You hear me? I hope they find a better role model for their kids.They could do worse than Sami's father.

He's a g*ng member.JoJo-main: ,There are plenty of reasons he might've been taken out.Bruno: He knew how to get people to hate him.Bruno: But that's not what his boss is thinking about.Bruno: The boss feels like his name wasJoJo-main: ,personally tarnished since one of his own was taken out.Bruno: That's why he told me to find out who took him out and settle the score.Bruno: I'm asking you...JoJo-main: ,Did you happen to run into Leaky Eye Luca at the airport?Giorno: No. I don't know who you're talking about.Bruno: You're not sweating.JoJo-main: ,All right, I'll believe you.Bruno: That does it for my questions.JoJo-main: ,Sorry to have bothered you, Giorno Giovanna.Giorno: What is that?JoJo-main: ,My hand was clenched the whole time.Bruno: That's Luca's right eye.Bruno: He's unconscious anyway, so I just brought it.Bruno: This taste... is the taste of someone who's lying, Giorno Giovanna!Bruno: Well, well, well, well...Bruno: I said I was done with my questions,Bruno: but the situation seems to have changed, Giorno Giovanna.Bruno: You told me a lie.JoJo-main: ,And now, I'm going to have to find out why you lied to me, aren't I?!Bruno: What are you looking at?JoJo-main: ,Are you jealous?JoJo-main: ,Did you want to hit him, too?Bruno: My name is Bruno Bucciarati.Bruno: Answer me.JoJo-main: ,Your questioning has already turned into t*rture.Bruno: Well? This is a pretty creepy ability, isn't it?Giorno: Th-That's...Bruno: Those are Luca's fingers.Bruno: To tell you the truth...JoJo-main: ,Leaky Eye Luca was disposed of by our boss.Bruno: He said that there's no point in him living anymore.Bruno: I took his fingers for torturing.Giorno: It's happening again! What the hell?Giorno: Is he also like that Japanese tourist?Bruno: Other than being able to tell if people are lying or not, I can also do this...Bruno: I can put whatever I want in your mouth.Bruno: For example...Bruno: I can even put that fire extinguisher in your mouth.Bruno: Though I'm afraid you'd die if I did that...Bruno: Talk!Bruno: You know who's responsible.Bruno: Were you told not to tell anyone?Bruno: Let's have you tell me who did Luca in.Giorno: There's no doubt about it... He has a similar ability!Bruno: If you don't hurry up and tell me, your t*rture is just going to get worse,Bruno: Giorno Giovanna!Giorno: This guy's bad news!Giorno: In that case...Giorno: I'll have to use Golden Wind and dodge his att*cks!

Polpo was convicted of a certain crimeJoJo-main: ,and won't be out for fifteen years.Bruno: But he gives me orders from the inside and commands the organization.Bruno: He can leave this place whenever he feels like it, but he doesn't.Bruno: There's simply no reason to.Giorno: But why?Bruno: You'll understand once you go in.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna, you're going to be interviewed by him, and you have to pass.Bruno: It's basically like any other job interview.Bruno: What the interview actually entails will depend on his mood,Bruno: but whatever you do, don't let him find out your true intentions.Giorno: All right.Giorno: Oh, yeah. The Stand ability...JoJo-main: ,That's what you called it, right?Giorno: I never asked how you ended up with that ability,Giorno: but are there others with it?Bruno: That'll also be answered once you get inside...Bruno: If you pass, that is.Cop: First, place your belongings, watch,JoJo-main: ,and everything in your pockets into the tray,Cop: then proceed to the next room for a body check.Lady: Stand right there and raise your hands over your head.Lady: Once you go through that gate, please continue straight down the hall.Lady: N- is where Polpo's cell is.Lady: The room is divided with reinforced glass, but you'll be able to talk to him.Lady: Touching the glass, giving him anything,JoJo-main: ,and receiving anything from him are all forbidden.Lady: You have fifteen minutes.Lady: Once you pass through, the gate will close.Lady: If something happens, please yell.Bruno: I'm going to meet him directly in his cell?Bruno: Not in some visiting room?Lady: You don't know who he is?Polpo: That left arm of yours...JoJo-main: ,Is it injured?Giorno: That's no bed...Loom,Sfx: GwoooPolpo: It's just on your right hand,Polpo: but the fingers are slightly red, like you were holding something.Polpo: Like lines that would be left after holding a bag.Polpo: Which would mean that you were holding a bag in your right hand up until now.Polpo: Why's that?Giorno: Well, uh... You're right.Giorno: I was holding a bag in my right hand,Giorno: because as you observed, I hurt my left arm.Polpo: I envy your ability to be so reckless with your body.Polpo: Would you like some wine?JoJo-main: ,I have some exquisite Chianti Classico.Polpo: It pairs perfectly with some Scamorza cheese and caviar on a cr*cker.Giorno: I've been told that I'm not allowedJoJo-main: ,to give you anything or receive anything from you.Polpo: They're just saying that.Polpo: What people say and what they do...Polpo: are vastly different.Polpo: That's the best and worst thing about people.Polpo: The only downside to being in this cell is.... well...Giorno: Polpo...Polpo: The fact that I can't admire Michelangelo's great painting in the Sistine Chapel.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,It's not that he doesn't need to leave the prison.Giorno: Things would just be the same for him whether he left or not.Giorno: With that body, he might actually be safer in the cell.Giorno: More importantly, how did he get through the door?Polpo: Bucciarati's told me all about you.Polpo: So you want to join our organization?JoJo-main: ,Hmm... Giorno Giovanna, was it?Polpo: Well, why don't we get this interview started?Giorno: What the hell was that?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Did my eyes play a trick on me?Giorno: For a moment, it looked like he took a bite out of his finger along with the cr*cker...Giorno: No... Maybe Polpo is also a Stand user, just like Bucciarati.Giorno: Either way, I can't let him find out that I'm one, as well.Polpo: What do you think is the most important thingJoJo-main: ,when it comes to choosing someone, Giorno Giovanna?Giorno: Is it what they're capable of?Polpo: Oh? And what exactly are you capable of?Giorno: I borrowed a few things when she was patting me down.Giorno: I thought these would be useful for your test.Giorno: Of course, I'll be returning them to her when I leave.Polpo: Do you have anything else?Giorno: Other than that, the only skill I haveJoJo-main: ,is being able to completely fold my ear into my head.Polpo: That's rather amusing.Polpo: But, you see...Polpo: There's something else that's far more important,Polpo: and that's trust, Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: The most important thing when it comes to choosing people is trust.Polpo: In comparison, being smart or being talented means as muchJoJo-main: ,as this piece of cr*cker between my teeth.Polpo: This test is all about seeing how trustworthy you are...Polpo: with this lighter's flame.Polpo: Take it, and make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: Whoa, there.JoJo-main: ,Be extra careful to make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: Fuller, the th-century theologian, said,JoJo-main: ,"He's my friend that speaks well of me behind my back."Polpo: In order to join our organization,JoJo-main: ,you'll have to show how trustworthy you are when we can't see you.Polpo: For  hours, you will hold on to that lighter without letting the flame go out.Polpo: If you can do that, I'll approve of you joining the organization.Polpo: Simple, right?JoJo-main: ,The lighter has plenty of fluid in it.Polpo: All you have to do is sit quietly in your room until  PM tomorrowJoJo-main: ,and make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: If you're a careful man who'll work hard to make sure it doesn't go out,JoJo-main: ,the flame shouldn't go out.Polpo: Which means you're someone we can trust.Polpo: However...Polpo: If you're a man who is taking us too lightly,Polpo: and you fall asleep, sneeze, or knock it over,Polpo: or a sudden wind blows the flame out...Polpo: It means that you're untrustworthy,Polpo: and I can't allow you to join our organization.Polpo: Now, take the lighter.Polpo: This is your entrance exam.Polpo: You have  hours.Polpo: I'm looking forward to seeing you come to visit me again tomorrow at  PM.Giorno: For  hours...Cop: All visitors must go through another body check when they go through the gate.Cop: Once you're told that you can leave the facility,Cop: please continue to the next room and grab your belongings.Giorno: Wait! Polpo didn't tell you anything?Lady: What?Lady: I'm going to pat you down now.Lady: Let me remind you that it's prohibited for you to accept anything from him!Giorno: sh*t! I was under the impression that Polpo bribed all these guys,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,giving me permission to take the lighter out of here!Giorno: Visitor, put your hands up and proceed forward!Giorno: So Polpo's test for me has already started...Giorno: And...Giorno: I have no choice but to go through with it!Giorno: I have to pass this test and get into Passione!Sign: Koichi HiroseSign: Reverb Act Lady: Visitor, hurry forward!Giorno: Just like I hid her ID in my hand where no one could see earlier,Lady: Put your hands up and proceed forward! I will conduct a body check!Giorno: I'll hide this flame!Lady: You're free to go.JoJo-main: ,There are no problems here.Lady: You may leave this facility.Lady: However...Lady: Please open up your hand.Lady: Let me remind you that it's prohibited to accept anything from him.Lady: Visitor, open up your hand! I'm going to check it.Lady: A flower?Lady: A real flower?Lady: Very well. I'll allow you to take that out.Lady: You are permitted to leave this facility.Giorno: I turned the lighter into a flower and hid the flame within it.Giorno: That was too close.Giorno: But is this flame Polpo's Stand ability?Giorno: The wind's definitely bad news!Guy: Hey, Giorno! Perfect timing!Guy: Could you push the shutter button on the camera?Giorno: No.Old: Sorry, but could you help me out here?Giorno: No.Giorno: I finally made it back to my dorm.Giorno: Th-That was close...Giorno: Now the lighter won't fall over, and even if the air moves,JoJo-main: ,the flame will be protected.Giorno: Now, just as Polpo said, I just need to watch over this for the next  hours.Giorno: I know.JoJo-main: ,I'll make sure my window is locked, just in case.Giorno: I need to make sure it doesn't randomly open and allow the wind to blow in here.Giorno: What?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Who's opening my door without even knocking?Giorno: Th-That's—Koichi: Looks like he's out.Koichi: Now's my chance.Giorno: It's that Japanese guy again!Giorno: His name was... Koichi Hirose!Giorno: How did he find out my address?Koichi: Looks like my suitcase and belongings are long gone.Koichi: But my passport might still be around.Koichi: It's probably harder to sell someone's ID.Koichi: I feel like a thief, sneaking into someone's room like this, but...Koichi: No! He's the thief here!Koichi: What's so wrong with trying to find what belongs to me?!Giorno: His passport? sh*t!Giorno: It's in the documents case on top of my desk becauseJoJo-internal/narrator: ,I'd planned to return it to him!Giorno: At this rate, Koichi's going to see the lighter's flame!Giorno: Then he'll probably put it out!Giorno: He'll think it'll set the place on fire!Giorno: What should I do?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I have to hurry up and retrieve that lighter!Giorno: Golden Wind!Giorno: I used Golden Wind to turn the light cord into a snake.Giorno: That bread is pretty delicious.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Good job biting into it!Giorno: Now I'll pull it up with the cord...Giorno: What? sh*t!Giorno: I can't believe this.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,He found the lighter.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,This isn't good.Giorno: I have to make sure he doesn't blow the flame out!Koichi: Oh?Koichi: This mark! The mark symbolizing Japan!Koichi: I found it! It's my passport!Koichi: I-It's burning!Koichi: Thank goodness...JoJo-main: ,Huh?Koichi: That's strange. I could've sworn I saw a lit lighter...Giorno: That was close.JoJo-main: ,He almost extinguished the flame.Giorno: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!Giorno: And to take my first step toward that dream,Giorno: I have to protect this flame, no matter what!Old: Whoa, that was close.Old: Sorry about that. I was cleaning the stairs.Old: I'm glad it was just a slight mist and the water didn't actually hit you.Old: This must mean we've both done good things in our daily lives.Old: Your daily actions are very important.Old: If you weren't careful, you'd probably be wearing that bucket of water on your head.Giorno: Seriously? This isn't good.JoJo-main: ,The flame...Giorno: I wonder if I can ask Polpo to let me try again.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,No...Giorno: If he were that forgiving, he wouldn't have tested me with this.Old: Flame?Old: Is that lighter not lighting up anymore?Old: Is it broken? Is it my fault?Giorno: No, it wasn't you.JoJo-main: ,I'm actually trying to process what happened...Old: But from what I can see, it doesn't look broken.JoJo-main: ,The lighter is still letting gas out.Giorno: What did you just say?Whoosh,Sfx: WhooshOld: Yes, there's still gas coming out.JoJo-main: ,Is this the switch?Old: Did you try pushing it?Giorno: No... It shouldn't be able to light.Old: But look at this fine craftsmanship!Giorno: This whole test depended on if the flame was lit or not.Old: It's a very impressive lighter.Giorno: If I were able to just light it again, there's be no point in this test!Old: I was startled by the size of the flame, but it looks like it's working fine.Old: See?Old: By the way, since you have that lighter, you're not smoking cigarettes, are you?Giorno: Something's wrong.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,It actually lit up again... There has to be something wrong!Giorno: What the...Giorno: That couldn't be his Sta—Black: You relit the lighter, didn't you?Black: I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths.Giorno: Th-That's...Black: The first path is to live and become a chosen one.Black: Your only other path is death.Giorno: A Stand!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,That's gotta be Polpo's Stand!JoJo-main: ,There's no doubt about it!Black: You relit the lighter!Black: This is your fate!Giorno: No way! You bastard! What the hell are you doing?!Black: This soul...JoJo-main: ,did not belong to one who should be chosen.Giorno: One who should be chosen?Giorno: H-Hey, are you...Giorno: He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...Giorno: Was it because...Giorno: That Stand pulls people's souls out and kills them with an arrow?Giorno: Is that it?Giorno: But does "the one who should be chosen"JoJo-internal/narrator: ,mean someone who can join the g*ng?Black: You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?Black: I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...

He's dragging my soulGiorno: out of me through my shadow!Black: I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...Black: The first path is to become a chosen one.Giorno: It's no use... It's stronger than Golden Wind.Giorno: The old man d*ed after his soul was struck by that arrow.Giorno: So what's going to happen to meJoJo-internal/narrator: ,if my Stand is att*cked?Black: Your only other path is death.Giorno: Th-This arrow...Giorno: If I actually get stabbed by that arrow, I'm dead for sure!Giorno: I've got no choice!Giorno: Even if Polpo is one of the capos,Giorno: if he's going to stand in my wayJoJo-main: ,and even k*ll an innocent old man like he was a piece of trash...Giorno: I have to defeat him!Giorno: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Giorno: Golden Wind...JoJo-main: ,Only your senses will go berserk, and all movements will look slow.Giorno: It's gone! That's impossible!Giorno: It shouldn't be able to control its own movements right now.Giorno: Even if it were able to move, it should be extremely slow.Giorno: It shouldn't be able to disappear!Giorno: It has to be around here somewhere...JoJo-main: ,It has to be!Giorno: I have to find it before the slowed-time effect wears off,Giorno: or it'll att*ck me again.Giorno: What?!Giorno: F-From within the shadows?! Sh-sh*t!Giorno: Its movements are slower, but it's still just as powerful!Giorno: I can't move at all!Girono: The shadows! It's in the shadows!Giorno: It can only move within the shadows, but at amazing speed...Giorno: Looks like it can't follow me into the sunlight.Giorno: But the sun's going to set on the other side of the school soon.Giorno: Once that happens, I'll have nowhere to run.Giorno: What'll happen if I force it out into the sunlight?Giorno: It's definitely worth trying.Giorno: But how am I going to drag it out?Giorno: What should I do? It's waiting right there.Giorno: It's waiting there patientlyJoJo-main: ,for the sun to go down.Koichi: Hey!Koichi: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Giorno: Koichi!Koichi: Who's that guy collapsed at the bottom of the stairs?!Koichi: What did you do to him?!Giorno: Hey, don't get the wrong idea!Giorno: That wasn't me!Giorno: That Stand right there atta—Koichi: The wrong idea?Koichi: I saw you talking to that old man!Koichi: I was watching from the window!Giorno: You were... watching?Giorno: Then... did you see the lighter being relit, too?Koichi: Huh?Giorno: Don't step into the handrail's shadow, Koichi!Giorno: Get out of the shadows!Giorno: Sh-sh*t!Black: You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?Black: You have two possible paths.Koichi: Wh-What's going on?Black: The first path is to become a chosen one.Black: Your only other path is death.Koichi: This arrow is...Giorno: Golden Wind!Giorno: It hurts so much...JoJo-main: ,This hurts like hell, but now...Giorno: it looks like I was able to drag you out into the sunlight.Giorno: I turned part of the handrailJoJo-main: ,into morning glories and let them hang down.Giorno: Now you're out of the handrail's shadow!Giorno: So close!JoJo-main: ,There were more shadows nearby, so it managed to escape.Giorno: But it looks like if I can drag that thing completely out into the sunlight,JoJo-main: ,I might be able to win.Koichi: Wh-What was...Koichi: What was that Stand?!Giorno: As you saw, it's trying to att*ck us.Giorno: The old man who relit this lighter was k*lled.Giorno: Because we saw it being relit,Giorno: both you and I are now its targets.Koichi: That's not what I meant.Koichi: That arrow... It's from the Bow and Arrow!Koichi: I didn't know one was in Italy, too...Koichi: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Koichi: Is it because of you that another Stand with the arrow appeared?!Giorno: It'll take too long to explain everything...JoJo-main: ,But I don't know anything.Giorno: Do you know something about that Stand?Giorno: And about that arrow?Koichi: Why did you save me?Giorno: Telling me about that arrow is more important!Giorno: The sun's going to set!Koichi: Why did you save me?!Koichi: Don't you dare assume that I feel like I owe a thief like you anything!Giorno: The lighter being lit is because of something I did.Giorno: There was nothing I could've done for that old man.Giorno: I feel awful about it.Giorno: I believe what I did was right, but I feel dark and gross inside.Giorno: But despite that,JoJo-main: ,I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream that I believe to be right.Koichi: Two years ago, I was sh*t with a similar arrow and gained my Stand ability.Koichi: If the person sh*t with the arrow doesn't awaken to that ability, they will die.Giorno: Awaken to the ability?Giorno: That's it!Giorno: That's what it meant by the "chosen one"!Giorno: Someone whose Stand awakened!Giorno: And that must be the motive behind Polpo's test!Koichi: I don't know about the origin of the arrow,Koichi: but I've met a Stand very similar to this one before.Koichi: It's a long-distance remote-controlled Stand!Giorno: Long-distance and remote-controlled?Koichi: It can only carry out simple commands,JoJo-main: ,but it won't stop attacking until it's fulfilled its motive.Koichi: Our best option is to find the Stand user and take them down.Giorno: Sadly, that's not an option.Giorno: The user is in a jail cell. We can't get to him.Giorno: Anyway,JoJo-main: ,that thing won't be able to leave the school building's shadow,JoJo-main: ,so let's head into the sunlight while it's still available.Giorno: Then, before the sun goes down,JoJo-main: ,we'll lure it into the shadow of something that can move,Giorno: and then we'll get rid of that shadow.Giorno: That way, we can drag it into the sunlight.Koichi: Got it!Koichi: I-It's gone!Black: I've got you!Giorno: Wh-What?!Black: You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?Koichi: The crows!Koichi: It hid in the shadows of those crows and moved over there in them!Giorno: Th-This thing...Giorno: It's useless!Giorno: Sh-sh*t!Giorno: While in the shadows, its power and speed are much higher!Koichi: Act !  Freeze!Koichi: My Reverb Act 's ability is to make Stands or people heavier.Reverb: I've made its hands heavier,Reverb: so much that it won't be able to lift a finger from the ground.Koichi: It should let go.JoJo-main: ,I made the entirety of its hands heavier!Koichi: It shouldn't be able to bend its fingers anymore!Giorno: It's strong...JoJo-main: ,It's determined to not let go, no matter what.Black: You have two possible paths...Koichi: I-It's no use!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Any damage inflicted upon the Stand goes right back to the user!Koichi: At this rate, Giorno's legs are going to break!Koichi: Act ! Undo  Freeze...Giorno: No.Giorno: Don't do that, Koichi.Giorno: This ability that makes things heavier... Don't you dare undo it.Giorno: This is perfect.Giorno: This is exactly the ability that I was looking for!Koichi: But your leg's going to shatter!Koichi: Wh-What?Koichi: That tree...Giorno: Golden Wind is an ability that continuously gives life,Giorno: so that tree continued to grow, lived the extent of its life,JoJo-main: ,and is now starting to wither.Koichi: Ability?Koichi: But that tree's at least ten meters away...Koichi: So you got to the tree's roots by digging that hole!Bam,Sfx: BamKoichi: Y-You did it! The shadow's gone!Koichi: It's been dragged out into the daylight!Giorno: You told me there were two paths,Giorno: but sadly, you only have one.Giorno: Koichi, could you move to the right a little?Koichi: Huh? Like this?Giorno: Hmm...Giorno: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Giorno: Bask in the sunlight.Giorno: That's it.Giorno: That's your one possible path.Giorno: Still, I have to wonderJoJo-main: ,if I'm going to be able to join the g*ng now.Giorno: What to do...Sign: PolpoSign: Shadow SabbathKoichi: That arrow...Koichi: The fact that the Arrow is also in Italy meansKoichi: that there'll be even more victims!Koichi: I need to hurry up and tell Jotaro!Koichi: Wh-What are you doing?Giorno: Did you just say there'll be more?Giorno: We defeated Polpo's Stand,which had the arrow.JoJo-main: ,You saw it for yourself.Koichi: Defeated? You've got this all wrong!Koichi: I'll admit that we managed to escape its att*cks because of you,Koichi: but that Stand only stopped attacking because of the sunlight.Koichi: The user isn't hurt at all. They're perfectly fine!Giorno: So Polpo's alive?Koichi: Not only that, but long-distance remote-controlled StandsJoJo-main: ,basically don't affect their users at all.Koichi: He probably hasn't even realized there's been a battle here.Giorno: What?Giorno: So he has no idea at all?JoJo-main: ,He doesn't know I'm a Stand user, either?Koichi: Chill out, would you?Koichi: If he noticed anything, it was probably that his hand felt a bit heavier,Koichi: but he'd have no way of knowing that you and I are Stand users.Koichi: Hey, could you move your finger?Giorno: Sorry, but I still can't let you make your call.Giorno: I'm begging you...JoJo-main: ,This isn't just one enemy.They're an organization.Giorno: If you tell someone, the organization might find out.Koichi: Enemy?JoJo-main: ,Organization?Giorno: I'll tell you and only you, Koichi.The_Next_Day,Sign: The Next DayPolpo: Someone gifted me a special-order pizza.Polpo: Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's see, you were...Polpo: Giorno... Giorno, uh...Giorno: Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: Ah, yes. Sorry about that.Polpo: My head goes blank when I eat.Polpo: Perhaps it's because all my blood goes to my stomach.Polpo: This might sound sudden, but are you a religious person, Giorno?Giorno: I'm not sure... but I'm not very passionate about it.Polpo: What I'm about to say may contradict God's teachings,Polpo: but I'd like you to listen carefully.Polpo: If the most important thing in this world is trust,Polpo: the most despicable thing you can do is insult someone.Polpo: Listen well... To insult or betray someone's trustPolpo: not only hurts their reputation,Polpo: but puts them in a very sticky situation.Polpo: We will not fight others or risk our lives over money, power,Polpo: or having our seats taken at a theater or on the bus.JoJo-main: ,Fighting is truly foolish.Only idiots bother with it.Polpo: But...JoJo-main: ,I will risk my life over being insulted.Polpo: I believe that God forgives even m*rder.Polpo: Don't forget that.Polpo: Congratulations! I will allow you to enter the organization.Polpo: You did bring me the lighter still lit, as I trusted you would.Polpo: You pass.Polpo: That's our Passione organization's badge.Polpo: It proves that you passed.Polpo: You'll be working under Bucciarati for a while.Polpo: How about it? Why don't we celebrate your...Polpo: Did that brat actually protect the flame for  hours?Polpo: Or did he relight it and become a Stand user?Polpo: I couldn't care less about that.Polpo: Young, clueless guys like him are easy to use.Polpo: Either way, we can use him however we want.Polpo: Oh?JoJo-main: ,I could've sworn I closed that...Polpo: The blood does flow to my stomach after I've eaten...Jotaro: You met him again?Koichi: I'm sorry, Jotaro.Koichi: But I can't help thinkingKoichi: that he, Giorno Giovanna, isn't as dangerous as you think he might be.Jotaro: What makes you think that?Koichi: Well...Koichi: Well, I'll tell you that in person.Koichi: Is that all right?Jotaro: All right.Jotaro: If that's what you want to do, that's fine.Jotaro: I'll be waiting.Koichi: Thank you.Koichi: I'll talk to you later.Koichi: Jotaro, back then, I really did think...Koichi: Does this Giorno kid really admire that?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is he sane?Koichi: But I can feel it...Koichi: I can feel that he has a righteous heart.Koichi: I can tell...Koichi: Because I observed three members of the Joestar bloodline back in Morioh.Koichi: The three who exude righteousness from their hearts, as if it were their life energy.Koichi: I could see the same thing in his eyes.Koichi: Without a doubt, the blood that flows in his veins carries the will of the Joestars.Koichi: So I'm going to keep this to myself for a while, like he asked...Koichi: The golden dream that Giorno Giovanna possesses.Koichi: Well, then, maybe I'll go do some sightseeing.The_Next_Day,Sign: The Next DayBruno: Come with me, Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: What was that noise?Polpo: Well, whatever.Giorno: When someone insults you, even m*rder is forgivable?Giorno: I see.

04x05 - Find Polpo's Fortune! / Let's Find Polpo's Fortune!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/24/23 09:15Bruno: Passione is a pretty big g*ng organization.Bruno: First, there are groups made up of six to ten underlings, like my team.Bruno: Then there are capos like Polpo who command those teams.Bruno: They reign over a particular region, making it their turf.Bruno: These teams include specialty teams, such as an assassination team and a drug team.Bruno: Despite being from the same g*ng,JoJo-main: ,I really don't want to involve myself with those teams or their capos.Bruno: And the one who stands at the top is the boss.Bruno: The boss only has contact with the trusted subordinate he considers his right hand,Bruno: and we have no way of knowing who or where he is.Bruno: g*ng members in this city hate standing out,Bruno: as it can quickly lead to their assassination.Bruno: So even the capos will dress normally to blend in with the crowd,Bruno: and some even have cover jobs.Bruno: That goes double for our boss.He won't reveal his identity to anyone.Bruno: If we go snooping around, we're detected immediately.Bruno: I know plenty of guys this has happened to.Bruno: So, Giorno, in order for us to get close to our mysterious boss,JoJo-main: ,we need to be acknowledged.Bruno: We can't defeat the boss unless we earn the acknowledgementJoJo-main: ,and trust of someone close to the boss.Bruno: So first, we're going to get stronger.Bruno: We have to climb up to the position of capo.Bruno: Of course, the two of us can't do that alone.Bruno: A team we can trust...Bruno: That's what we'll need to defeat the boss.JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio  Find Polpo's Fortune!Nar: The news of the incarcerated Polpo's death spread among the other capos.Guy: According to our intelligence team, it might've been su1c1de.Guy : That's not his style.Guy : Polpo was in a special cell. m*rder isn't possible.Guy : Maybe he was plotting to betray the boss.Guy : There aren't many capos as trustworthy as him.Guy : That's even less believable.Guy: More importantly...Guy: Yeah... The problem is his successor.Girl: How do I look?Sign: Rome : a.m.Sale: I just heard that the capos are freaking out.Sale: Apparently, Polpo committed su1c1de.Mario: Huh?Sale: Hey, watch where you're going!Mario: I'm fine.Mario: su1c1de? That fatso?Sale: I told you to watch where you're going!Sale: So I dunno if Polpo was sad because he was in prison or if his obesity made him depressed,Sale: but he apparently wasn't very strong mentally.Sale: He put his own g*n in his mouth and blew his brains out.Mario: You sure it was su1c1de and not m*rder?Sale: It was su1c1de, for sure. From the... autopsy, they call it?Sale: Any expert can tell if it was a su1c1de or m*rder.Sale: Hey, there's a light up ahead.Sale: More importantly, have you heard the rumors about Polpo's fortune?Mario: Rumors?JoJo-main: ,I don't know where the end of the universe is, and I don't know jack about that, either.Sale: Before Polpo went to prison,JoJo-main: ,he converted some of his fortune into jewels and goldSale: and hid them somewhere.Sale: He has a hidden fortune.Sale: It's too much to even deposit in the bank, and he kept it secret from the organization.Sale: No one was stupid enough to look for it while Polpo was alive.Sale: But now that he's dead, that fortune doesn't belong to anyone.Sale: It's free money.Sale: It's said to be worth about five billion lire.Mario: Five billion?Mario: If I had that much money,JoJo-main: ,I'd be heading to Monaco or Japan with a girl on each arm.Sale: Nah, I'd rather work my way up.Sale: If I can climb up to capo with that money, I can taste honey that's even sweeter.Sale: But who knows where it's hidden...Mario: No one knows?Sale: Nah, and this is just what I'm thinking...Sale: But Polpo was such a fatty, he couldn't even go outside on his own.Sale: Do you think he could hide a fortune worth five billion on his own?Sale: He must've had someone do it for him.Sale: Someone who's good at keeping their mouth shut...Sale: Though I'm not sure anyone like that actually exists.Sale: But Polpo liked Bucciarati.Mario: Bucciarati? That's one of the thugs from Naples, right?Sale: Yeah. If anyone could've hidden it, it's him.Sale: And now that Polpo's dead, Bucciarati should be making his move...Sale: to get the five billion lire that's just been freed up.Sale: I'm sure that even Bucciarati wants money.Sale: Hey, Zucchero!Sale: That bastard Zucchero actually left!JoJo-main: ,Did he seriously believe that?Sale: If you're actually going to trail Bucciarati, I'd be careful.Sale: Apparently, he and his subordinates are Stand users.Rome___a_m_,Sign: Naples : a.m.Nara: Hey, Fugo.Nara: It's such a nice day outside.JoJo-main: ,It wouldn't hurt to skip out on studying for one day.Nara: I'm just not feeling it today.Waiter: Thank you for waiting.

Just do as I've taught you.Fugo: You've got a good head on your shoulders.Fugo: Okay, ready? What's six times five?Nara: Six times five... Six and five...Nara: Thirty?Fugo: Correct! See? I knew you could do it!Fugo: You're basically halfway there!Nara: I see! Six times five is thirty! Okay!Mista: Hey, what's the deal with this?!Fugo: What do you mean? It's strawberry cake.Mista: Yeah, I can see that by looking at it!Mista: It's obviously not chocolate cake or cheesecake!Mista: That's not the point here!Mista: There are four slices of cake!Mista: Do they want me to die?!Fugo: Again with this, Mista?Mista: You moron!JoJo-main: ,It's bad luck to choose one from four!Mista: Choosing from five is fine.Mista: Choosing from three is fine.Mista: But when you choose from four, something bad will happen!Mista: When I was a kid, another kid adopted a kitten fromJoJo-main: ,a litter of four that was born in our neighborhood,Mista: and then the cat scratched his eye right out of his head!Mista: Of course, he b*at the cat to death later.Fugo: That's just an old wives' tale.Fugo: If you think about it rationally,Fugo: when people eat a cake one slice at a time,JoJo-main: ,someone's going to have to take one of the last four slices.Mista: That's the thing, though!Mista: This is when the restaurant should be more considerate and just bring us three slices!Mista: Talk about shitty service!Fugo: Jeez... Don't eat it, then.Mista: But I want some strawberry cake!Nara: I did it!Nara: I did it, Fugo! How's it look?Fugo: You're finished?

Ha, you're two years younger than me.Gio: Thank you for the tea.Abba: What's wrong?JoJo-main: ,You just thanked me for the tea that I so generously poured for you.Abba: Since you already thanked me for it, you'll just have to drink it.Abba: Or do you not want to drink it since it's not very hot?Mista: Maybe he doesn't want to drink it because he doesn't want to be one of us.Bruno: What the hell are you guys doing?!Gio: It's nothing.Gio: He went to the trouble of pouring this tea for me.Nara: No freakin' way!Bruno: What did you guys do?Nara: Gross!

Just tell me! Okay?Gio: Who knows?JoJo-main: ,You're all keeping your abilities secret, too, aren't you?Abba: So he's a Stand user?Gio: What I did with the liquid in the cup is...Gio: I used my ability to change one of my teeth into a jellyfish,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,which is  percent liquid, to suck it up.Fugo: Is it, like, some ability to move things?Mista: Open your mouth. There's no hole in there, is there?Nara: You actually drank it for real?Bruno: I'm not sure what it is,JoJo-main: ,Was that your favorite or something?Bruno: but there's something about Giorno Giovanna that makes him hard to dislike.Fugo: If you guys tell me about your powers, I might tell you mine.Giorno: You're cautious.

We're far enough away from the shore now.Bruno: We're headed to Capri.Abba: Capri?Fugo: We're not going there as tourists, are we?Bruno: Correct.Mista: Then why are we going there?Bruno: This morning, the capo Polpo committed su1c1de.Mista: What? su1c1de?! Polpo did?Nara: No way!Fugo: But why?Bruno: It doesn't matter why he d*ed.Bruno: Polpo was a capo who did things that'd get him k*lled.Fugo: But what does he have to do with why we're going to Capri?Bruno: Polpo actually has a secret fortune.Bruno: It's worth...Bruno: ten billion lire!Abba: T-Ten billion?Bruno: I'm the only person who knows where it's hidden.Bruno: I'm the one he ordered to hide it.Bruno: That ten billion now belongs to us!Bruno: With that money, we can claim the rank of capo!Nara: A-Awesome!Fugo: He's definitely a man who's going to the top.Fugo: Just like I thought, he's going to become a capo!Abba: He earned this opportunityAbba: by working diligently enough to be acknowledged and liked by a capo.Abba: Amazing.Mista: Seriously? This took a sudden turn for the awesome.Nara: Where is it?Nara: Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?Bruno: I can't tell you that yet.Bruno: Rumors of his hidden fortune have made the rounds in the organization.Bruno: No one can find out before we secure the money.Nara: B-Bucciarati!Bruno: Hey! Something's wrong!Bruno: Did something happen, Narancia?Mista: Narancia!Mista: What the heck are you doing?Mista: H-Hey, come look at this!Gio: There's only one shoe left...Abba: Give that here, Giorno!Fugo: I don't quite understand what's going on.Fugo: Where did Narancia go?Bruno: You guys didn't see it?Bruno: To me, it looked like Narancia got pulled into this box.Fugo: What?Mista: That's impossible!JoJo-main: ,He didn't randomly fall into the ocean, did he?Abba: Narancia, where are you?Mista: Hey, Narancia! If you're just fooling around and hiding... Hup!Mista: Hurry up and answer us!Bruno: Narancia, where are you?Giorno: Narancia! Answer us!Fugo: Mista?Fugo: What are you doing, Mista?Fugo: Mista?Fugo: Where did you go, Mista?Bruno: It can't be...Fugo: Come on, Mista!Fugo: Why are you messing around now—Bruno: Fugo?Bruno: Hey, Fugo!Abba: What?Giorno: What's going on?Bruno: Abbacchio, Giorno, stay close to each other!Bruno: We're being att*cked!Bruno: There's someone hiding somewhere on this boat!Bruno: This is a Stand att*ck!Abba: But why now?Bruno: The money.Bruno: Someone found out that I knew where the money was,Bruno: and they're trying to steal it.Bruno: Which means they're from the organization.Abba: Does that mean they've been quietly tracking us ever since we were on the shore?Bruno: Looks that way.Bruno: They probably grew impatient because I wouldn't just say where the money is.Bruno: They intend to get rid of everyone but me, then make me cough up the location.Bruno: And they can take their time, since we're on the ocean with nowhere to run.Abba: Are you saying Narancia and the others are dead?Bruno: I didn't say that.Bruno: But it's for ten billion.JoJo-main: ,They'd even k*ll someone from their own organization for that.Giorno: No, Narancia and the others are alive.Giorno: They're somewhere on this boat.Giorno: I don't know if this person is trying to use them as hostages,Giorno: but they're alive.Abba: Giorno Giovanna,Abba: how the hell can you be so sure about that?Giorno: I used my Stand to turn Narancia's shoe into a fly.Giorno: The fly is trying to return to its owner, Narancia.Giorno: If Narancia was truly dead, it wouldn't be flying around searching like that.Bruno: Can you locate him?Giorno: He's alive... He's alive, but...Giorno: It's not going down into the cabin or in the locker.Giorno: The fly's not trying to stop...Giorno: It keeps flying around that area looking for Narancia.Abba: What the hell is his ability?Bruno: Just shut up and listen.Giorno: Narancia is somewhere near the entrance to the cabin.Giorno: That's a fact.Giorno: But for some reason, the fly can't find him, so it's lost.Giorno: I think it's safe to assume that we'll find the enemy wherever Narancia is.Giorno: Which means the enemy isn't just randomly hiding behind something.Bruno: I see.JoJo-main: ,So if we don't figure out the mystery behind the enemy's ability,Bruno: getting too close without knowing could get us k*lled.Giorno: Correct.JoJo-main: ,But the fact that their ability requires them to att*ck while hidden is a shortcoming.Giorno: If we can figure out the mystery behind it, we'll be able to defeat them.Bruno: Abbacchio, your Stand...Bruno: might be perfect to defeat such an enemy.Giorno: Defeat?Giorno: Can you solve this mystery with your ability?Abba: Hard to say...Bruno: Damn it, Abbacchio!Bruno: You'd better not be hung up on stupid sh*t at a time like this!Abba: Stupid sh*t?JoJo-main: ,No.Abba: This has to do with my safety.Abba: I can't just carelessly reveal my Stand abilityAbba: in front of a stranger that I can't trust.Abba: Bucciarati,Abba: I don't know what made you trust this guy,Abba: but I don't consider him a part of the team.Bruno: If we don't figure out the enemy's location, we're going to be k*lled!Abba: And I'm saying that's just this untrustworthy brat's hypothesis.Abba: He just came up with it out of fear. He didn't see anything.Bruno: Abbacchio!Abba: The enemy is just hiding somewhere in the cabin.Abba: I'll find them and take care of them.Giorno: If we get close without figuring out the mystery, we're going to get kil—Abba: Shut your mouth!Abba: You stupid little brat...Giorno: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.Abba: What are you talking about?Giorno: You can solve the mystery, right?Giorno: I'm counting on you!Bruno: Giorno!Bruno: What the hell are you doing?!Crunch,Sfx: RoarBruno: G-Giorno!Bruno: There's an enemy over there!Bruno: sh*t!Bruno: Giorno's in trouble!Bruno: Abbacchio...Abba: Giorno Giovanna... You're one crazy bastard.Abba: All this to prove yourself...Abba: What the hell is wrong with you?

The fly's coming around now.Bruno: That's strange...Bruno: Where is the enemy going?Bruno: How and where is the enemy hiding?Abba: Regarding this enemy's abilities...Abba: I hate to admit it, but it looks like I'll have to accept what Giorno was saying.Abba: I'll use my Stand to solve this mystery!Abba: But... This spot's bad news, Bucciarati!Abba: Moody Jazz!Abba: Does Narancia from five minutes ago work?Bruno: Yeah. That should be fine.Abba: Is the fly all right?Bruno: It's heading toward the bow.Bruno: Now's our chance. Do it quickly.Abba: Yeah.Bruno: What's that noise?Abba: His headphones.Abba: Five minutes ago, Narancia was listening to his boombox.Nara: Huh? What's wrong with this thing?It just stopped working!Nara: Why'd it stop?Bruno: This isn't it.Nara: I just bought it!Bruno: Narancia was att*cked a little after this.Nara: Damn it! How dare he sell me something like this?!Abba: I'll try fast forwarding and searching.Nara: That stupid old guy from the electronics store is gonna regret this!Bruno: That ten billion now belongs to us!Bruno: With that money, we can claim the rank of capo!Nara: A-Awesome!Nara: Where is it?Bruno: That was my voice.Nara: Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?Bruno: It was right after this conversation that Narancia was att*cked!Bruno bg: I can't tell you that yet.Bruno: We'd better be able to see just how he was att*cked, Abbacchio.abba: My Stand replays everything.abba: We'll be able to see everything, from Narancia's sweat to his pulse.Abba: And it'll follow him everywhere.Bruno: It's about time.Bruno: Let's get behind Narancia.Bruno: He's about to be att*cked!Bruno: L-Look!

So he's inside the pipe.Bruno: This is the answer to our mystery.Bruno: His nails, flesh, and bones are all floppy like a condom,Bruno: even his shoe and his belt buckle,Bruno: but he still has a pulse.Bruno: Just like Giorno said, he's alive.Bruno: So that's what's going on...Bruno: The enemy is also doing this to his own body,Bruno: hiding in pipes or between the planks or walls,Bruno: and he's dragged in Mista, Fugo, and Giorno, as well.Bruno: That explains why Giorno's fly can trace the general area,Bruno: but can't pinpoint exactly where they are.Abba: We figured out the enemy's ability.Abba: Now all we have to do is chase the enemy,Abba: find out where Narancia and the others are and save them,Abba: and then b*at the sh*t out of the guy.Abba: I'm resuming Moody Jazz's replay.Bruno: Chase?

Better hope youdon't get dragged down!Mario: Wh-What the hell are you doing?!Bruno: I didn't punch the deck earlier to find where Abbacchio was.Bruno: It was to put a hole in the bottom of the boat.Mario: A h-hole?!Bruno: Abbacchio figured out where you were,Bruno: and he was kind enough to show me...Bruno: where you are and how to know for sure.Bruno: It was Abbacchio's blood.Bruno: Abbacchio intentionally hurt his hand and showed me the blood trail.Bruno: The blood trail didn't go down below the deck!Bruno: It was cut off right on the deck!Bruno: So what does that mean, and where was he dragged to?Bruno: I rented the yacht that was on the left.Bruno: Abbacchio realized that when he looked up at the sky.Bruno: I know where you are, so if you don't wanna drown,Bruno: you'd best come out.Bruno: There were two boats!Baaaaaa,Sfx: BwaaaaaMario: You bastard...Bruno: You were hiding by thinly covering this yacht with another one.Bruno: You were traveling through the thin gap between them and attacking us from there.Bruno: No wonder we couldn't figure it out. You get points for that.Mario: Stay back, Bucciarati!Mario: I'll k*ll your friends!Bruno: You should know better than anyone thatBruno: you couldn't survive in a g*ng if a measly little thr*at like that scared you.Bruno: Give up, and I'll forgive you.Bruno: But the moment you s*ab Abbacchio...Bruno: I will end your life.Fwip,Sfx: FwipBruno: It's just as Giorno said.Bruno: The fact that you had to hide to att*ck is your weakness.Bruno: You're way too slow.Pop,Sfx: PopBruno: Abbacchio!Abba: Well done...Bruno: Abbacchio,Bruno: what's important isn't the end result.Bruno: It's how you get there.Bruno: Join my team.Bruno: Don't die bound by your past.

Over.Sale: Was that yacht named Lagoon?Sale: What's your current location?Mario: We're about two hours out from Capri.Mario: Bucciarati is wary of anyone following him, so he's taking a very roundabout route.Sale: Got it.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I'll take a high-speed boat and wait for you at Capri.Sale: Dock at Marina Grande. Over and out.Abba: That's the end of the conversation. The radio cut off.Fugo: How could this be?Fugo: This isn't good.

Who the hell was on the radio?Mista: I'm going to make this guy tell us who it is, no matter what!Bruno: No, he's a hardcore gangster.JoJo-main: ,It'll probably take some time to get anything out of him.Bruno: He probably won't say anything today.Bruno: Besides, he might not know what his partner's Stand looks like.Bruno: It's very possible his partner's kept it secret even from him.Mista: Then what are we supposed to do?Mista: What if we just come ashore like this?Mista: If they find out we're the ones on this boat instead of Zucchero...Fugo: Also, if this boat doesn't arrive at Marina Grande in about an hour...Fugo: They guy on the radio is sure to think something happened to Zucchero.Fugo: If that happens, who knows if we'll be able to get the money?JoJo-main: ,In fact...Fugo: I have my doubts we'd make it back to Naples in one piece!Abba: What are we going to do, Bucciarati?Bruno: There's no time to hesitate.Bruno: We should at least outfox the guy.Bruno: I'll somehow get to the island first and—Gio: Before this boat docks,Gio: all we need is someone to head to the island first and get rid of the guy.Nara: What the hell are you talking about?Nara: Are you sure you're not stupid?Nara: Get to the island before this boat?JoJo-main: ,What are we supposed to do? Swim there?Gio: Yes.Nara: Huh?!Gio: I can change this ring buoy into a fish.Gio: If I have it pull me, I'll be able to get to the island faster than this boat.Gio: Of course, since it's my Stand, I'll be the one going.Gio: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.Gio: I want that ten billion lire.Gio: We have to use that money to make Bucciarati a capoGio: and move our way up the ranks.Bruno: Giorno...Abba: You're going to go?

Nothing.Gio: He's supposed to be somewhere on this island.Gio: Is he just being too cautious to answer the radio call?Sale: Did something happen, Zucchero?Sale: Why did you request an announcement?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is there a problem? Over.Gio: What's going on?Gio: No one's heading toward the watchhouse.Gio: He's there! How?!Gio: This isn't good. Does that watchhouse have a back entrance?Gio: He's already inside the watchhouse!Gio: It's too dark to see his face.Gio: Mista hasn't realized he's in there!Gio: At this rate, the guy's going to realize this is a trap and run!Gio: I have to let Mista know!Mista: What? The guy's coming to answer the radio call?Mista: Which one is it?Mista: Who's heading toward the watchhouse?Gio: N-No!Gio: He's not heading there!Gio: He's already inside!Gio: Don't come out!Gio: He's by the window!Sale: That guy is...Sale: one of Bucciarati's guys!Sale: Didn't Zucchero take care of him on the yacht?Gio: Mista! Behind you!Gio: He's on the radio! Mista!Gio: Damn it! He can't hear me.Gio: It's better than him not noticing!Gio: He's already there!Gio: Mista! He's already on the radio!JoJo-main: ,Come on!

This isn't good!Mista: I haven't seen his face yet!Mista: Giorno probably hasn't, either!Mista: I don't know what his Stand is yet, but I don't have a choice!Mista: This is for the ten billion and Bucciarati!Mista: Eat lead!Gio: Mista!

That's why he hasn't d*ed!Sale: To tell you the truth, Mista,Sale: I'm ecstatic that you att*cked me.Sale: So much that I'm willing to forget the fact that you sh*t a b*llet at my head.Sale: I mean, it was up in the air if Polpo's fortune actually existed or not.Sale: It's just a rumor among some thugs, after all.Sale: But the fact that you att*cked me means it actually exists!Sale: I'm overflowing with hope and motivation! All right!Sale: I can passionately steal the ten billion from that bastard Bucciarati!Sale: I told you it would be easy for my Stand to deflect your b*ll*ts!b*ll*ts: Yee-haw!Sale: Wh-What?! Another b*llet showed up from the shadows?Sale: He fired two b*ll*ts in a single sh*t?Sale: Is that Mista's Stand?Sale: But...Sale: I can still deflect it somewhat!b*ll*ts: Hell yeah!Mista: Well done, Six b*ll*ts Number  and Number !Mista: And now that we've thrown you from the truck,Mista: there's nothing more to worry about!Sale: Ow! You sh*t me again, you bastard!Sale: But... you're not getting away.Sale: This is for ten billion! You're not getting away!Mista: There is a way to defeat him.Mista: But he's strong... That's a fact.Mista: Will I be able to do it?Sign top: SaleSign bot: Arts & CraftsGiorno: Blood...Gio: A vehicle...Gio: The enemy and Mista are in a car, heading toward the top of the island.Gio: Will I be able to catch up with them?Gio: Either way, I need to find a car to chase them in.Mista: Four b*ll*ts?Mista: What the hell's going on?JoJo-main: ,I only have four b*ll*ts!Mista: Why do I only have four left? Seriously!One: Mista, it's because you dropped some b*ll*ts!b*llet: You dropped them, dummy!b*llet: Four is unlucky.Five: Don't put all four in there. It'll just be bad luck.Guy: I-I can take my hands off the wheel!JoJo-main: ,Yes! My feet can move, too!Guy: Now I can finally stop!Mista: Don't you dare stop!Guy: Huh? B-But you told me to stop the truck earlier!Mista: And what I'm saying right now is more correct, at least when I'm talking to you.Mista: Listen up. I want to go back to Marina Grande.Mista: My buddy's back at the marina.JoJo-main: ,There has to be another way back there.Mista: I won't harm you. I'll even thank you if you take me back.Mista: Got it?!Mista: That bastard stops the b*ll*ts at the surface of his skin so they don't penetrate his body.Mista: The ability to fix things in place...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,How am I supposed to b*at him?Mista: If I can just sh**t into his mouth...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,The inside of his body should be defenseless.Mista: He might actually die.Mista: But I only have four b*ll*ts left.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Damn it, talk about unlucky!Mista: Three would've been much better.Mista: Now that I've seen his face and know who he is, I don't need to do anything dangerous.Mista: It'd be much safer to meet back up with Giorno at the marina.Mista: I have extra b*ll*ts with the rest of my things, too.Mista: Th-That bastard!Mista: Impossible! He scaled the cliff already?!Mista: Hey, stop the truck!Guy: Huh? Now what?Mista: Stop the truck, I said!Mista: Hurry it up!Guy: Th-That's the guy from earlier!Sale: Mista...JoJo-main: ,There's no way in hell I'm going to let you tell your buddies who I am!Sale: I'm not letting you get away, Mista!Mista: He can affix rocks in the air, just like the b*ll*ts?Mista: He climbed up here like he was using a ladder?Mista: Why the hell did you stop the truck, you dumbass?!Guy: Huh?Mista: Drive!Guy: Huh? Wait, what?Mista: Full speed ahead! You'll be sorry if you stop!Mista: If you want to settle things right here, right now...Mista: Let's do this!Mista: Driver, don't you dare stop the truck!Sale: Just gotta tap it slightly with my finger...Sale: Even if it's just slightly, if I tap it over and over,Sale: it'll just keep building up force in the place where it's affixed.Sale: I can't hit it too hard.Sale: It'll throw off my aim, and my enemy will figure out which way it's going to fly.Sale: And then... I let it loose!Bam,Sfx: BamMista: What?!Sale: It came back to you, Mista.Sale: Those three Stands of yours that you just fired lost control and flew off.Sale: Just a little at a time...JoJo-main: ,You just keep tapping it with just a little bit of force.Sale: Just like tapping an SOS in Morse code.Sale: The aim's not perfect, so I can't use it on things that move around too much,Sale: but I can definitely use it on you right now!Mista: Th-This really sucks...Mista: Talk about bad luck.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Four is always the absolute worst for me.Mista: Ever since I was a kid...Mista: There are just some misfortunes you can't see.Mista: Still, other than that, it's a good number.Mista: I only have one b*llet left, but this means the worst is over, right?Mista: Now the number's one, damn it!Seven: Number ! Number ! Group up!Seven: We're all gonna group up on this last sh*t!Seven: This is the the last of them, so give it your all!All: Yeah!Sale: Stay put, Mista!JoJo-main: ,Don't you try to sh**t me again, you dumbass!Sale: Just look at this distance! No matter what abilities your Stand uses on the b*ll*ts,Sale: or how many you fire,I clearly have the upper hand.JoJo-main: ,I have plenty of time to defend myself!Sale: You've realized by now that it's impossible to b*at me, haven't you, Mista?Mista: If I told you...Mista: that I only have one b*llet left in this chamber, would you believe me?Mista: I'm telling you the truth.JoJo-main: ,I only have one b*llet left.Mista: If I sh**t it and you somehow manage to deflect it,Mista: I'll be out of b*ll*ts.Mista: You'll find out anyway, so I might as well tell you now.Mista: If I miss this last sh*t, you'll see that I'm out of b*ll*ts!Mista: Though messing up is hypothetical right now...Mista: I'm definitely going to sh**t you with this one, final b*llet!Sale: What are you pointlessly rambling on about, Mista?Sale: It doesn't matter to me how many b*ll*ts you have left.Sale: Whether you fire a single b*llet or a hundred, you can't defeat me!Mista: It's not pointless at all.Mista: You're definitely going to let your guard downJoJo-main: ,now that you know I only have one b*llet left.Sale: This is pointless.Five: He's gonna use his Stand!Seven: Leave it to me!Seven: Let's go! We only have one target!JoJo-main: ,Give it your all!Sale: You're aiming for the inside of my mouth.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Am I wrong?Five: He opened his mouth on his own!Six: He's not going to defend himself!Seven: We'll just have to charge right in!Sale: I knew it.Sale: Ow!Sale: I knew you were aiming there...Sale: At the inside of my mouth!Sale: That's what any normal person would think...Sale: That I shouldn't be able to use my ability to affix things inside my body.Sale: It's a pain in the ass to guard myself, so I opened my mouth for you!Mista: Impossible...JoJo-main: ,He can even affix things inside his mouth to guard against the b*llet?Sale: Damn... This really freakin' hurts!Sale: But... it looks like you weren't lying about that being your last b*llet.Sale: I see you're not sh**ting again.Sale: You done now, Mista?Sale: If you're finished...Sale: The launching power on this baby...Sale: is more than ready, Mista!Sale: Take this! Release!One: He really did let down his guard.Six: He let his guard down because Mista was out of b*ll*ts!Seven: We just wanted to get closer to him,Seven: because the closer we get, the better we can aim!Sale: Wh-What?!Sale: Wh-When did they—Sale: sh*t! They're too close!One: Here we go, boys!One: Aim!Sale: Arts & Crafts! Defend!Sale: The b*llet split in two?!Sale: It won't matter if he gets one more clean hit on me,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,but... he's not aiming for that, is he?Sale: That's not good.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Don't tell me... he's aiming for that!Sale: That's—Mista: I aimed for the same wound.Mista: If I sh**t another round at the one that's stopped in your head,Mista: it's going to push it just enough to dig further into your skull!Mista: I mean, if you're invincible enough to withstand that too, I'm sorta screwed, but...b*ll*ts: We did it!b*ll*ts: Yes!b*ll*ts: Yes!Mista: Come on, Number .JoJo-main: ,I keep telling you to not bully Number , jeez...Mista: He's still somewhat alive, even though he's got a b*llet in his brain.Mista: Guess your Stand really is invincible.Mista: Bucciarati told me not to k*ll you, but...Mista: Hey, we're going back! Back to the marina!Guy: What do you want?!JoJo-main: ,What the hell is with you guys?!Guy: Damn it.Guy: Who the hell do they think I am?JoJo-main: ,Telling me to stop, then go...JoJo-main: ,I'm not a freakin' taxi, you dumbasses!Guy: How dare you thr*aten me?!Guy: I'll let you off the hook for now, but next time I'm gonna let you have it!Gio: I'm terribly sorry, but I'm chasing someone.Gio: Could you take me to the top of the island in this truck?Gio: Quit wasting time!

04x09 - The First Mission from the BossQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/24/23 09:24Mista: Ow...Fugo: Yeah, you're going to have to go to the hospital.Mista: I know that! I'm asking you to do something in the meantime!Fugo: Very well.Mista: H-Hey, Fugo, you aren't—Mista: Hey!Mista: What the hell is this?!Nara: Staples!JoJo-main: ,But wow, it actually closed up, just like closing a comic book!Fugo: Narancia, could you wrap up his stomach with masking tape now?Nara: Sure thing.Mista: You sure this isn't going to get infected?Nara: Don't worry about a thing.Mista: Actually, you know, I kinda like it.Bruno: Would you pipe down?Bruno: Well done, you guys.Bruno: Thanks to you, we were able to get to Capri safely.Bruno: Zucchero, who att*cked us on the boat,and the guy Mista handledJoJo-main: ,are both passed out on the boat. No need to worry about them anymore.Nara: Then let's hurry up and go to the place where the ten billion lire is hidden!Abba: Where did you hide it, Bucciarati?Abba: A hidden safe at the bank?JoJo-main: ,Or maybe you buried it in a cave on the island?Bruno: Could you wait just a bit longer?Fugo: Why's that?Fugo: Why are you so worried about the time?Nara: Shh!Nara: Hey, you guys. We're still in here, so how 'bout it?Nara: Can't you do the cleaning later?Trish: Does your name happen to be Toilette?Nara: Huh? What was that?Trish: If your name is actually Toilette, that would mean this is your house.Trish: You can boss around anyone you want in your own house.Trish: But if that isn't the case, you've got no right to boss me around.Nara: Huh? Hey, wait, dumbass!Nara: Didn't you hear me? I said not to go in there!cr*ck,Sfx: cr*ckNara: Wh-What the hell do you think you're doing?!Nara: You want a piece of me?!Abba: What's going on?Fugo: A new enemy?Nara: I'll k*ll you!Bruno: Wait!Bruno: Everyone, stop Narancia!Nara: Why did you stop me?!Bruno: Could you be...Peri: That voice...JoJo-main: ,It appears we've kept you waiting.Bruno: All of you, bow.Bruno: This is Mr. Pericolo, one of the capos of Passione.Peri: I came to accept the ten billion lire,Peri: Bucciarati.JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio  The First Mission from the BossBruno: I contacted him as soon as we reached the island.Bruno: Mr. Pericolo came all this way to accept the money.Gio: One of Passione's capos...Bruno: Thank you so much for coming all this way, sir.Peri: No, no. I'm the one who said I wanted to come.Peri: All of you, lift your heads.Peri: You must be the newbie I heard about.Gio: Yes, sir.Peri: Bucciarati's told me all about you.Prei: Now that you've joined Passione, you're basically family.Peri: You're free to call me Mr. Pericolo.Gio: Thank you, sir.Peri: You, there. Sorry about earlier.Peri: This one doesn't like being touched.Nara: Sure.JoJo-main: ,You...Fugo: You mean, "Yes, sir!"Bruno: Mr. Pericolo,JoJo-main: ,why are you dressed up as a janitor?Peri: There's a perfectly good reason for this. I'll tell you later.Peri: More importantly, you do have it, don't you?Peri: The ten billion lire to hand over to the organization.Peri: Yes, sir. Right here.Mista: What? What did you just say?!Fugo: He said it's right here!Nara: Here?!Mista: Bucciarati, where is it?Fugo: All I see are urinals...Plop,Sfx: PlopAbba: I-It was inside the urinal?!Mista: I mean, that's as safe as it gets, but...JoJo-main: ,Sucks to be the guys who've been peeing there this whole time!Peri: Yup... It's real.Peri: This necklace alone is worth at least seven or eight hundred million.Peri: Bucciarati,Peri: I won't bother asking how you got this fortune.Peri: All the organization cares about is that you have the money.Mista: Wait, you're already putting it away?Nara: C-Could I just touch it a little?JoJo-main: ,Maybe even smell it?Peri: The reality this fortune shows us is that the owner is intelligent and trustworthy.Peri: Congratulations, Bucciarati.JoJo-main: ,You've been promoted to the position of capo.Nara: H-Hell, yeah! He's a capo!Nara: Bucciarati's finally a capo!Peri: You'll be taking over Polpo's turf, now that he's dead.Peri: You'll be overseeing the gambling, money-lending,JoJo-main: ,and smuggling at the harbor, as well as the restaurants and hotels in Naples.Peri: Fifty percent of the profit will go to the organization, and the other fifty will be yours.Mista: That's amazing!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,He earned authority just like that!Mista: With Bucciarati's brains and popularity, he'll be rolling in the cash in no time!Mista: But the ball suddenly started rolling as soon as this newbie Giorno joined.mistA: Is he some kind of lucky boy or something?Peri: By the way,Peri: I know you just took over for Polpo,Peri: but he had left one job unfinished.Peri: Of course, you'll be taking on any jobs that Polpo had, Bucciarati.Peri: Are you okay with that?Bruno: A job that Polpo left unfinished?Peri: It's a direct order from the boss.Bruno: The... boss?Abba: The boss...Mista: The boss no one's ever met?Nara: An order... directly from him?Peri: Correct. I'll tell you right here and now.Peri: You'll be guarding the boss's daughter, and risking your lives doing so.Peri: That's all.Nara: Daughter?Gio: The boss...Fugo: Did you say "daughter"? The boss has a daughter?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,The boss we were eventually going to track down and defeat has a daughter?Peri: You'll start guarding her right now. I've handed her over to you.Bruno: Handed her over?Gio: Bucciarati!Gio: Could that guy be...Gio: No, not "guy."Gio: She must be the boss's daughter!Bruno: That's her?Trish: Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?Peri: That's fine, Trish.Bruno: For now, stay by her side.Bruno: The order is already in effect.Peri: Bucciarati.Peri: Her name is Trish Una, and she's fifteen years old.Peri: "Una" is her mother's maiden name, not the boss's family name.Peri: Trish hasn't met the boss once in her life.Peri: Bucciarati, as you're well aware, no one knows who the boss is.Peri: But of course, even the boss has a past, especially when he was young.Peri: Two months ago, a woman named Donatella d*ed of illness in Calabria.Peri: A few days before her death, she asked that a man named Solido Naso be found.Peri: That man was Trish's father.JoJo-main: ,I'm sure she was just trying to look out for her daughter's well-being,Peri: but...bruno: Naso doesn't exist.JoJo-main: ,Because that was one of the aliases that the boss used when he was young.Bruno: Correct?Peri: Beware of anyone trying to look into the name Naso.Peri: Anyone with any status in Passione is very cautious about that.Peri: Just trying to look into the boss's past would meanJoJo-main: ,challenging the organization itself.Peri: Word about Donatella eventually spread.JoJo-main: ,Word spread even more when it came out that she had a daughter.Peri: Of course, the boss caught wind of this, as well.Peri: The boss's decision was immediate.Peri: Through a few other men, he gave me the orderJoJo-main: ,and placed her in my custody soon after her mother's death.Peri: The boss must've known immediately.Peri: He didn't know she existed until now,JoJo-main: ,but he knew for a fact that Trish was indeed his daughter.Peri: And right after I took Trish into my custody,Peri: we found out that someone was after her life.Peri: If the boss's order had come even thirty minutes later,JoJo-main: ,Trish most likely would've been kidnapped by them, and then...Peri: m*rder*d.Bruno: Who is it? Who's after her?Peri: People who have betrayed the organization.Peri: We don't know how many of them there are.Peri: They're trying to defeat the boss and take over his drug trafficking routes.Gio: dr*gs...Peri: They're under the impression that Trish knows a secret about the boss.Peri: They want information so that they can defeat the boss.Peri: But Trish is just a frail little girl who knows nothing.Bruno: How long will we be guarding her?Peri: One week... Actually, it could even be less.Peri: It's just until the boss finds those traitors and gets rid of them.Peri: Leave this island immediately and hide her somewhere.Peri: The only ones who know that Trish is with you are the boss and myself.Gio: Mr. Pericolo.Gio: You said that order was supposed to go to Polpo, correct?Gio: Which means...Peri: The enemies are Stand users...Peri: I'd say that's a safe assumption.Peri: They're most likely moving as a team, as well.Peri: We don't yet know how many there are.Peri: I don't have a Stand ability.JoJo-main: ,This is all I can do for you.Peri: I'll contact you again if I learn anything else.Trish: Um...Fugo: M-Me?Trish: Yes. Is it with you... um...JoJo-main: ,Am I going to be with you now?Fugo: Yes, that's correct.Fugo: But it'll be all six of us.Fugo: We will be risking our lives to protect you.Trish: I see.JoJo-main: ,Then would you mind taking off that jacket?Fugo: My jacket? Why?Trish: Just hurry up and take it off.Trish: It's not as if I want to see you shirtless or anything.Fugo: V-Very well.Trish: I don't have a handkerchief, so go buy one for me.Trish: Also, some stockings and Givenchy Blush No. .Trish: The stockings need to be reinforced at the thighs.Trish: Get the latest issue of Italian Vogue, too,Trish: and some mineral water.Trish: I'd rather die than drink one that's not from France, though.Trish: When you're done gawking at the scenery, go buy that stuff for me.Gio: Guard the boss's daughter, huh?Gio: So we suddenly have a connection to the mysterious boss that I've been looking for.Gio: This is definitely worth doing.Gio: If we can see this through,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Bucciarati will be able to gain the same level of trust that Polpo had.Gio: But if we fail, it'll mean our lives.Gio: All six of us are well aware of that fact.Form: What's your problem?

Giorno!Bruno: You three head to Pompeii and get that key!JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio   The Second Mission from the Bossfugo: The city of Pompeii was known to the Romans as a peaceful, prosperous health resort.Fugo: It was then abruptly destroyed by the lapilli and lavaJoJo-main: ,that came from the eruption of Mt. VesuviusFugo: on August th,  AD.Fugo: Later, archaeologists discovered that all the houses, streets,Fugo: wine bottles, and even carriage tracks left behindJoJo-main: ,were preserved as they were when the volcano erupted , years ago.Fugo: The dog mosaic we're looking forFugo: is located near the entrance of the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii.Gio: Oh, Fugo,Gio: you were supposed to turn right at that corner, not left.Fugo: You should've told me sooner, Giorno.Fugo: What point is there if you tell me that after I turn?Gio: You're exactly right.Gio: I apologize. I'll be more careful next time.Fugo: That's not the point here, damn it!Abba: Hey, Fugo.Abba: We're in a hurry, so don't lose it now.Fugo: I know that!Fugo: Damn it...Abba: Well, Fugo's always like this.Abba: I'm more concerned about this newbie, Giorno Giovanna.Abba: If Bucciarati insists that I treat him as one of us, I'll follow his orders,Abba: but there's just something I don't like about him.Abba: This guy's going to do something...Abba: Something that might get us k*lled.Abba: Pompeii, huh?Abba: I haven't been here since I visited on a field trip as a kid.Fugo: Abbacchio, Giorno, let's hurry.Fugo: The place we're looking for is about  meters ahead.Fugo: It should take us about thirty minutes to get what we needJoJo-main: ,and get back to the others.Fugo: Abbacchio, Giorno, be on your guard.Fugo: To think we'd be found so soon...Abba: How many are there?Fugo: One... for now.Fugo: He's peeking around that stone pillar behind us.Gio: Pillar? Which one would that be?Fugo: Wake up, Giorno.Fugo: There's only one pillar.Fugo: Can't you see it?Abba: Fugo, there is definitely a single pillar,Abba: but I don't see anyone, either.Fugo: Quit messing around! He's heading right toward us!Abba: Fugo?Fugo: There! The guy walking over here!Fugo: H-He was right there...Fugo: A guy came out from behind that pillar!Fugo: I saw him in this mirror!Fugo: Wh-What?!Fugo: There! He's right there! He's coming out!Fugo: H-He's inside the mirror?Fugo: He's revealed his Stand! Who's going to fight him?!Abba: Hold on, Fugo. I have no idea what you're talking about.Gio: Is something wrong with the mirror?Fugo: This isn't good! He's going to att*ck!Fugo: Get away from the mirror!Fugo: What?Fugo: Giorno! Abbacchio!Fugo: Wh-Where are you, Giorno? Abbacchio?Fugo: Where did you go?!Fugo: The guy who was in the mirror is gone, too.Fugo: What did he do?Fugo: It was bizarre to have a mirror hanging in a place like this to begin with!Fugo: What in the world is this ability?Fugo: I don't...Fugo: I don't know what it is...Fugo: But there's something off about this scenery.Illu: I'm right here.Fugo: What?!Illu: Pannacotta Fugo...Illu: Highly intelligent, with an IQ of , and entered university at the age of thirteen.Illu: But he went berserk on a professor thereJoJo-main: ,and b*at him senseless with a four-kilogram encyclopedia.Illu: From then on, he spiraled down to where he is now.Illu: The ones who accompanied him are the former cop Leone Abbacchio and...Illu: No documents on the other guy. He must be new.Illu: I think I heard you call him Giorno.Fugo: What did you do to them?Fugo: Y-You bastard...Fugo: Where did you hide them?!Fugo: My watch is backwards?Fugo: Also, I was wearing it on my left wrist, but now it's on my right?Fugo: D-Don't tell me this place is...Fugo: Your ability is—Illu: I guess you're pretty quick on the uptake.Illu: One at a time, Fugo...Illu: It didn't really matter who was first,Illu: but we'll start with you, since you were the first to look at the mirror.Fugo: I-It wasn't Abbacchio and Giorno that disappeared...Fugo: W-We're inside the mirror!Fugo: It was me!JoJo-main: ,I'm the one who was dragged in!Abba: Fugo!JoJo-main: ,Where did you go, Fugo?!Abba: Hey, Giorno!Abba: Didn't you see anything?!Gio: I'm not sure.JoJo-main: ,It looked as though he suddenly disappeared to me, as well.Abba: Fugo! Where did you go?!Gio: Before he disappeared, Fugo yelled at us to get away from the mirror.Gio: And he asked whether we could see the man walking from behind the the pillar.Gio: This mirror...Gio: Is there something... about this mirror?Illu: The question is...JoJo-main: ,Where did you hide the boss's daughter?Illu: That's the most important question...Illu: But I'm pretty sure I also need to know whyJoJo-main: ,you three came to Pompeii, the city of death.Illu: I figure you're here to look for something...Illu: And if that's the case, you came here to get something that'll help you protect the girl,JoJo-main: ,isn't that right?Illu: If you turn just up the way, it'll lead you to the famous dog mosaic.Illu: Is there something there?JoJo-main: ,Well?Illu: I'll be taking it!JoJo-main: ,Tell me what you came here for, Fugo!Fugo: I refuse!Illu: Then die!Fugo: No...Fugo: You'll be the one dying when you witness my ability!Fugo: Purple Smoke!Fugo: My Stand won't appear?Illu: I see... So your Stand is named Purple Smoke.Fugo: Something's wrong. My Stand did come out.Fugo: I can feel it... So why?Abba: Hey, Giorno...Abba: Slowly walk toward me.Gio: Slowly what?Abba: Just come over here, you dumbass!Abba: Forget the "slowly" part! Just get over here!Gio: What?! Th-That's—Abba: Giorno! Forget about that!Abba: That's not our enemy! That's Fugo's Stand!Abba: Just hurry up and get away from it!JoJo-main: ,Don't get any closer!Gio: Fugo's—abba: Get away from Purple Smoke!abba: Hurry up!Illu: Your current location is inside the mirror.Illu: I'm sure you can figure out exactly why I dragged you in here alone.Illu: If I'd brought you in here along with the others,JoJo-main: ,who can fight, it'd put me in danger!Illu: I control the inside of the mirror... That's my ability.Illu: All the things in here are objects that have no life.Illu: You and I are the only living beings here.Illu: That's because I didn't allow anyone else.Illu: I only allowed you, and you alone, to come in.Illu: Which means... your Stand ability was left outside!Illu: This is my Mirror Man!Fugo: Purple Smoke has appeared outside the mirror.Fugo: Then there should be some way to fight!Sign bot: Mirror ManSign top: IllusoNar: Pannacotta Fugo was born into a wealthy familyJoJo-internal/narrator: ,that owned a huge home in the suburbs of Naples.Nar: On top of being born into a life of luxury,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,he was born with high intellect, having an IQ of .Nar: It appeared as though he lived the perfect life.Nar: But the weight of the expectations that his parents and othersJoJo-internal/narrator: ,put on Fugo were slowly crushing his young heart.Nar: At times, Fugo would experience fits of rage that even he didn't understand,Nar: but he would do everything he could to control them and get by.Nar: Then, when he entered university just after turning thirteen,Nar: that rage went out of control in the worst possible way.Creep: Fugo.Fugo: Professor.Creep: What are you doing here so late?Fugo: I'm working on the assignment due next week. I couldn't find the right judicial precedent...Creep: Oh, come on.JoJo-flashback: ,I told you that if there's anything you didn't understand, you could come to me anytime.Fugo: No, I shouldn't keep bothering you...Creep: My job is to teach and lead young people like you in the right direction.Creep: How about it?JoJo-flashback: ,Why don't you come by my house again for dinner, and...Fugo: Please excuse me.Creep: Now, wait just a moment.Creep: I wouldn't mind telling you what's going to be on the next test...Creep: It'll be fine. Just relax, now.Fugo: Stop... Stop...Fugo: Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!Creep: I'll be gentle.Fugo: I told you to stop, damn it!Fugo: I looked up to you!Fugo: You piece of sh*t!Guy: Did you hear?JoJo-flashback: ,Apparently Fugo's really close with one of the professors.Guy: Are you sure he wasn't the one to lead him on?Guy: That's probably how he got into this school, too.Nar: Fugo's parents used their money to ensure he was found not guilty,Nar: but they then treated him like filth and disowned him.Nar: All alone, Fugo started shoplifting and picking pockets to survive.Nar: Ironically, this lifestyle actually let him use his intellect to its full potential.Guy: You little bastard! How dare you try to dine and dash?!Guy: I'm gonna make sure they throw you in jail!Fugo: No, that won't be possible.Fugo: Are you familiar with the De Sica vs. Argento case from ?Fugo: Going by that judicial precedent,JoJo-flashback: ,there's a very good chance that the court will see this as me acting out of necessity.Guy: Mr. Bucciarati! Please say something to this brat!Bruno: Well, that sounds interesting.Nar: That was right around the time Bucciarati was thinking about creating his own team.Fugo: That basically sums up my life story.Fugo: Please don't pity me.JoJo-flashback: ,I don't think of myself as unfortunate.Bruno: I see. But, well... I think our meeting is fate.Bruno: Would you like to join my team, Pannacotta Fugo?Bruno: I want your intellect and knowledge.Fugo: Mr. Bucciarati, was it?Fugo: Joining a g*ng doesn't sound so bad, but I've already made up my mind.Fugo: I'm going to live on my own, not bothering with anyone else.Bruno: Oh? And why is that?Fugo: I told you.Fugo: When I lose my temper, I do horrifying things.Fugo: If I were to join your team, I might even end up k*lling you.Bruno: In that case, let's see if that'll actually happen.Bruno: Come with me, Fugo.Bruno: I'll bring out the best in you,JoJo-flashback: ,including that fierce, impulsive rage of yours.Nar: Those words moved Fugo's heart.Nar: After that, Fugo underwent Polpo's test and gained Purple Smoke.Gio: So this is Fugo's Stand...Gio: Fugo's not here, but his Stand appeared for some reason.Abba: Since that thing appeared, Fugo must be okay for the time being, but...Abba: Damn it! Where the hell is Fugo?Abba: How's he protecting himself?Abba: Get back, Giorno!Abba: Get back even further!Abba: Fugo rarely lets this guy out.Abba: He only does when he's in serious trouble.Abba: Which means that Fugo's trying to fight somewhere!Abba: Get further back, Giorno!Gio: He seems to be more worried about that Stand than about where Fugo is.Gio: He acts like he feels threatened.Gio: What the? It just started attacking out of nowhere!Abba: This isn't good. We really shouldn't stay here.Abba: We're getting out of here! Come on!Gio: I don't know what you're talking about!Gio: There's something in that mirror!Gio: We need to find where Fugo is!JoJo-main: ,That's far more important right no—Abba: Stop talking back to me, you little sh*t!Abba: I don't care what happens to you,JoJo-main: ,but I'm trying to be nice and warn you, since you don't know what's going on!Abba: It punched it! Run, Giorno!Illuso: I see.Illuso: So you activated your Stand outside the mirror.Illuso: But... that doesn't mean a thing!Illuso: It doesn't matter what your Stand tries to do with its ability.JoJo-main: ,It will never be able to hit me.Illuso: But I can hit you as many times as I like and finish you off!Illuso: A crow?Illuso: Why did a crow fall?Gio: A crow just suddenly...Abba: Stay back.Abba: When Purple Smoke uses its fists, no one can stay nearby.Illuso: What the hell is with these corpses?Abba: It's a k*ller virus.Abba: That's Fugo's Stand, Purple Smoke's ability.Gio: A virus?Abba: Look at its hand.Abba: When it hits something with its fist, that capsule breaks open,Abba: and the virus comes spilling out!Abba: The virus disperses into the air and enters your bodyJoJo-main: ,through inhalation or skin contact.Abba: It then multiplies rapidly.Abba: It infects its host within thirty seconds, then kills them instantly.Abba: And once the virus spreads, it doesn't matter who's nearby, be they friend or foe.Abba: Just like those crows, all of your metabolic functions will shut down,JoJo-main: ,and you'll die as you rot from the inside out.Abba: That includes your Stand, too.Gio: What's its range?Abba: Five meters.JoJo-main: ,Right now, Fugo should be controlling his StandJoJo-main: ,somewhere within five meters of his opponent.Gio: That's definitely important, but what's the range on the virus?Gio: How close do you have to be to be infected by the virus?Abba: At this distance, we should be safe.Abba: The virus that comes from that capsule diesJoJo-main: ,within a few dozen seconds of exposure to an average indoor level of light.Abba: So those crow corpses will soon be disinfected by the sunlight.Abba: Savage!Abba: It att*cks like an expl*si*n, and then disappears like a storm.Abba: It's a Stand that personifies Fugo's violent nature.Gio: What's it doing?Abba: I think it's trying to wipe off the drool that dripped on its leg.Abba: It always looks pissed off, but it's apparentlyJoJo-main: ,really high-strung, and really cares about being clean.Abba: I guess you could say that's the Stand's idiosyncrasy.Gio: It doesn't look like the Stand itself is very intelligent...Abba: It's just a reflection of his violent side.Abba: That would also mean Fugo's isn't able to see Purple Smoke.Abba: He's not controlling it properly at all.Abba: If he was, he wouldn't let it do that.Illuso: This corpse...JoJo-main: ,This crow...Illuso: Is it sick?Illuso: Was it infected by some virus or bacteria?Abba: I knew it... Fugo's unable to control it.Abba: It just att*cked some random spot again.Gio: Wait, is it actually random?Gio: There must be something in that mirror!Illu: Now the mirror got att*cked from the outside...Illu: But it's no use, Fugo.Illu: That's just a normal mirror,the kind you can find anywhere.Illu: No matter what your Stand is doing out there...JoJo-main: ,No matter what ability it may use...Illu: Not even viruses can enter Mirror Man's world!Fugo: Abbacchio, Giorno, please get my message...Fugo: Please make sure you don't get dragged into the mirror!Abba: We need to hurry, Giorno!Abba: Hey, Giorno!Abba: Don't just stand there! Let's go!Gio: Let me ask you this... Where are we going?JoJo-main: ,To get the key?Gio: You're willing to abandon Fugo, who's in danger right now?Abba: Watch your mouth, you bastard.Abba: Listen up. Our mission is to get the key and safely get that girl to the boss!Abba: I want to save Fugo as much as you do,Abba: but getting that key is paramount right now!Abba: Even if I was the one currently being att*cked instead of Fugo,Abba: I would want you guys to abandon me.Gio: I beg your pardon...JoJo-main: ,but I don't believe that's true!Gio: Fugo is indeed in danger, but he hasn't lost!Gio: We should risk our lives and save him!Gio: And making any movements when we don't know the enemy's abilityJoJo-main: ,is dangerous to us, as well.Abba: No! All three of us being taken out is the worst possible outcome!Abba: I'll say it again! We're moving on! Come on!Gio: And I humbly decline!Gio: We're going to solve this mystery, save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!Gio: That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!Abba: I have seniority here, so in this situation, what I say goes!Abba: Are you still going to decline?Abba: You'd better be prepared!JoJo-main: ,That is, if you manage to survive!Illu: I'll ask you one more time, Fugo.Illu: What are you looking for here?Fugo: I have no intention of telling you.Illu: I see.Illu: Very well. There are still two others.Illu: I just need the last one standing to tell me.Illu: You're finished. Take this!

Someone outside the mirror is running.Illu: Does that mean your friends decided toJoJo-main: ,abandon you so that they could go get something?!Illu: They're heading toward the dog mosaic.Illu: That settles it.Illu: Fugo, you're basically done for already.Illu: I'm going to go get whatever that thing is first!Fugo: W-Wait, you bastard!Fugo: Abbacchio... Giorno...Abba: Where is it? Where is this key?Abba: There it is. That must be it.Abba: A mirror?JoJo-main: ,Has that always been there?Illu: What is that? A key?Abba: What?Illu: I see.Illu: I guess I just have to take that key from you.Abba: That's... It couldn't be...Illu: Now that you've seen me,Illu: you're finished, too!JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio   Mirror Man and Purple SmokeAbba: Sh-sh*t!Abba: Damn it...JoJo-main: ,I'm starting to understand the enemy's ability.Abba: So he's inside the mirror...JoJo-main: ,Assuming that's even possible.Abba: Fugo must've been dragged into the mirror and disappeared,Abba: separating him from his Stand.Abba: Regardless, right now, I need to grab that key!Illu: Shattering the mirror actually worked in my favor, Abbacchio.Illu: Anything reflected becomes an entrance to this world.Illu: Now that it's in shards, I have even more entrances to grab you from!Illu: And I'll give you, and only you, permission to come into the mirror!Illu: There! I've brought you in.Illu: I'll be taking that key, too!Illu: Wh-What?!Illu: O-Only a Stand can grab the neck of another Stand!Illu: There's no way you could grab Mirror Man's neckwhen I'm the one who dragged you in here!Abba: Shattering the mirror didn't actually work in your favor!Abba: It just means the space you can look outside from became smaller!Abba: You couldn't see who you dragged in here, could you?Abba: You gave permission...JoJo-main: ,for just me to enter?!Illu: Th-That's...Abba: Grazie! I'll happily get dragged in!Abba: Moody Jazz!Illu: sh*t! That's a Stand!Abba: Inside the mirror...JoJo-main: ,So it's a world where everything's reversed.Abba: Of course we couldn't know.JoJo-main: ,There's no way we'd comprehend this ability until we were actually att*cked.Abba: Fugo must be in here, too.Abba: So, how do we get out of here?Abba: If I have to k*ll you to get out of here, that's fine.JoJo-main: ,That's why I sent Moody Jazz in there!Illu: The ability to transform into others...Illu: Well, sh*t. You got me.Abba: Looks like your Stand itself isn't that strong.Abba: So, what? Can it only defeat powerless humans?Abba: Well, what are you waiting for? Get on your feet and come at me!Illu: Listen up... Like I said at the start, you're already done for.Illu: I must say, I was a little surprised when it was your Stand that came in,Illu: but that doesn't change a thing!Illu: The reason I'm not standing is so that I can crouch down.Illu: I'm crouching because I need to!Abba: Well, yeah.Abba: You're bent over to make it easier to kick you.Illu: I was crouching so I could pick up this shard of the mirror!Illu: Hey, why are you so surprised?Illu: Is it because I have this arm?Illu: I'm sure you're very familiar with this arm!Illu: I told you! Anything that reflects becomes an entrance!Illu: If I can get your reflection with a different shard,Illu: that becomes another entrance!Illu: Do you get it now?Illu: It's your arm that I dragged in here!Illu: To make sure you can't move about, I'll only allow half of your body to come in.Illu: As for your Stand, I permit half of it to get out!Illu: Now your Stand won't be able to move!Illu: The key's mine!Abba: Damn it. He's going to take the key.Abba: That doesn't just mean we failed the mission.Abba: It also means that Giorno will end up being correct!Gio: And I humbly decline!Gio: We're going to solve this mystery, save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!Gio: That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!Abba: Damn it... My pride's not going to stand for that!Abba: I'm not letting him have that key!Abba: I swear on my pride and my dignity that I, Leone Abbacchio,Abba: will protect this key!Illu: It's true. Because Mirror Man uses all its energy to drag someone in,JoJo-main: ,it doesn't have much destructive power. That is indeed one of its traits!Illu: But if I do this to you, we don't exactly need strength to k*ll you off instantly!Illu: If we just s*ab this in with the strength of a four-year-old child, it's pretty easy.Illu: I win! Thanks for telling me where the key i—Abba: Something wrong? Go on, finish me off!Illu: What the hell are you doing, Abbacchio?!JoJo-main: ,How dare you hide it from me?!Illu: Even if you can move with your current body, it won't be much!Illu: I'll be able to tell immediately! Get it?!Abba: Hide?Abba: What are you talking about?Abba: What exactly did I hide, and where?Illu: What the hell are you doing, you bastard?Illu: Let me see that hand!Illu: Seriously, what the hell are you doing, you bastard?!Abba: Did you lose something?Abba: Did you find what you were looking for? Well?Illu: Why did he do that to his own hand?Illu: Wait... If he chopped off his own hand,Illu: his Stand's hand outside the mirror is...Illu: It can't be...Illu: Its hand is gone!Illu: Don't tell me...Illu: I-It has the key!Illu: And it's going back!Illu: If I remember correctly, a newbie named Giorno is just around the corner!Illu: He chopped off that hand to give him the key?!Abba: You should've sliced open my throat when you had the chance.Abba: If you had, my Stand's hand would've stopped moving.Abba: Whoops, so close. But you're a bit too late.Abba: That was the sound of the key falling to the ground.Abba: The key is going to get picked up!Illu: That's some bullshit you pulled off!Illu: But I'm not letting that brat named Giorno get away!Illu: I'll drag him in here, too!Abba: Do you understand now, Giorno, you shithead?!Abba: All that matters is that one of us returns safely.Abba: If you return safely with the key...Abba: The most important thing is to fulfill the mission.Illu: Hey, Abbacchio.Illu: Can you even imagine what's going on over here?Illu: You sure have a loyal companion.Illu: After you worked so hard to deliver the key...Illu: What do you think's going on over here?Illu: Not a damn thing!Illu: That brat's not running away at all!Illu: It looks like he doesn't have a clue what's going on.Abba: Giorno! Get the hell out of here!Abba: Take the key and run!Illu: He won't hear you when you're screaming inside this mirror!Abba: Sh-sh*t...Illu: Now then, there are two possible actions I could take.Illu: First is disposing of Giorno after I get the key.Illu: Second is slitting Giorno's throat first, then safely retrieving the key.Illu: Let's see...Illu: I guess I'll slit Giorno's throat first!Illu: He's noticed me.Illu: I'll allow only Giorno to enter!Illu: I've dragged him in!Illu: Slice open his throat, Mirror Man!Illu: Wh-Wh-What?!Illu: H-He's... That's impossible!Illu: It's the virus! G-Giorno...JoJo-main: ,He's been infected by Fugo's Purple Smoke!Gior: You're not getting the key!Gio: And Fugo, Abbacchio, and I... will safely return to the others!Sign: Pannacotta FugoSign: Purple SmokeAbba: Giorno Giovanna... That brat doesn't understand anything!Abba: You're going to die if you infect yourself with Purple Smoke's virus!Abba: My heart d*ed along with him back then.Abba: I don't feel anything anymore.Abba: I don't feel a damn thing, even though I've lost my hand...Abba: The only time I can feel at easeJoJo-internal/narrator: ,is when I'm following the orders of something great and absolute.Abba: Because then, all I need to do is be a soldier who doesn't have to think for himself.Abba: Meaning...Abba: Getting the key and protecting the boss's daughter...Abba: Carrying out this mission is the most important thing.Abba: And yet Giorno... That stupid brat...Abba: He chose to put himself in danger toAbba: save Fugo and me, rather than taking the key back safely!Illu: Damn you, you stupid brat!JoJo-main: ,How dare you come in here infected?!Illu: Are you out of your damn mind?!Illu: Now I'm infected, damn it!Gio: Ah, yes. You seem to be experiencing the same symptoms as me.Gio: Apparently Purple Smoke's virus infects your whole body within thirty seconds.Gio: It's over now.Gio: It was over as soon as you dragged me in.Fugo: Shards of the mirror that Purple Smoke shattered...Fugo: Did Giorno put them back together?Fugo: When the enemy chased after Abbacchio, he took some shards with him.Fugo: Giorno must've realized that!Fugo: He then figured out the enemy's ability from that,Fugo: then infected himself with the virus andFugo: allowed himself to be dragged into the mirror!Fugo: Because there's no other way to defeat this enemy!Illu: Damn it! Of all the underhanded...Illu: But don't underestimate me.Illu: It's not too late yet.Illu: I need more resolve, but it's not too late yet!Illu: Mirror Man! Allow only me to leave this mirror!Illu: But don't allow the virus!Illu: The part of me that's infected is not allowed to leave!Gio: That's not good!JoJo-main: ,If he gets outside, the virus will be separated from him!Illu: Abbacchio lopped off his own hand to get the key.Illu: So, I, Illuso, c-can do the same thing!Illu: This is nothing!Fugo: Giorno! Grab him!Fugo: He got away...Fugo: Giorno... After you...Fugo: risked your own life to come in here...Gio: So... he stepped outside the mirror.Illu: Th-That was really close, but, ha!Illu: My resolve... My resolve wins in the end!Illu: This is nothing!Giorno: I figured he'd go outside.Gio: That's for the best, though. He's going down, no matter what.Gio: Now that he's stepped outside, there's a chance I might survive!Gio: Fugo! Now that he's outside, Purple Smoke can follow him!Gio: Finish him off!Fugo: I can't, Giorno.Fugo: I can't tell where he is from inside here.Fugo: I have no way to att*ck him!Gio: I know where he is.Gio: Golden Wind, who's outside, turned that brick into a snake.Gio: That's why it's moving.Gio: Snakes can tell where humans are by sensing their body temperature.Fugo: Got him!Illu: What?!JoJo-main: ,A-After I built up the resolve to chop off my own arm and came out here...Illu: This... This can't...Illu: S-Stop it! Stop! Damn it!Illu: I'm going to be infected! I-If that virus capsule bursts...Illu: I-It looks like luck hasn't completely abandoned me!Illu: If Mirror Man can stop this thing's punch even for a moment...Illu: If I can just block it once...Fugo: Let him have it, Purple Smoke!Illu: Mirror Man! Use everything you have left!Illu: I...Illu: I did it...Illu: I stopped it! Now I just need to take this arm...Illu: into the mirror!Illu: Huh?Illu: What?!Illu: What?!Illu: B-But I blocked its punch...Illu: After I built up the resolve... to leave the mirror!Fugo: W-We did it! We're outside the mirror!Fugo: We defeated him, so his ability disappeared!Fugo: B-But Giorno, Purple Smoke's virus has already spread throughout your body.Fugo: Once you've been infected, even I can't do anything about it.Gio: Yes, Fugo, and this is how it should be.Gio: This...Gio: Him leaving the mirror worked out for the best.Gio: Once I was infected and he dragged me into the mirror,Gio: his defeat was inevitable.Gio: But I was glad when he refused to admit defeat and left the mirror.Gio: Since the mirror world was undone before I d*ed,Gio: I was able to encounter this snake.Fugo: Th-That snake...Fugo: It's alive, even though it's surrounded by Purple Smoke's virus!Gio: I created this snake from the brick where Purple Smoke's capsule was broken.Gio: Since it was born from a place that was covered with the virus, it won't get sick.Gio: Do you know what that means?Fugo: That snake has immunity!Fugo: And if we take blood or cells from something with immunity...Fugo: We can create a serum that'll stop the virus from spreading!Gio: Golden Wind!Gio: Extract the serum from this snake and inject it into me!Fugo: Giorno Giovanna...Fugo: I thought he was some newbie that I just couldn't figure out,Fugo: but he comes up with the most insane ideas and pulls them off...Fugo: And there's something I can trust behind that.Fugo: It's not something that's spoken.Fugo: He has true loyalty within him!Fugo: Just like Bucciarati did back then!Fugo: Giorno! You have my utmost respect after risking your life!Gio: No, Fugo...Gio: I'm not the one who risked my life here.Gio: I just made a prediction and followed through.Gio: The one who truly risked his life here... was Abbacchio.Gio: His hand is in grave condition right now.Gio: He's the one who risked his life to protect the key...Gio: And if he hadn't carried the key all the way here,Gio: we couldn't have defeated the enemy.Gio: Please don't worry about me... and go tend to his wounds...Fugo: Giorno!Fugo: Are you okay, Giorno?!Abba: Damn it, Giorno...Abba: I was going...JoJo-main: ,to b*at the sh*t out of you...Abba: But with my hand like this, I guess I can't.Abba: I'll just have to do it later...Nar: Thus, they got the key they were ordered to retrieve!

I'm right, aren't I?Pesci: I didn't run into anyone!Pesci: Bucciarati, his crew, the newbie, and the boss's daughter definitely aren't here!Pro: Something's strange...Pesci: Bro, the train's about to leave.Pesci: They must be hiding somewhere inside this station.Pesci: They're gonna keep an eye on us tracking them and hop on another train to get away.Pesci: Let's use some homeless guy or something to search the station!Pro: There was something placed at the drinking fountain.Pro: He must've picked it up.Pro: He picked up something that looked black!Pro: Get on, Pesci!Pesci: But why?!Pro: I just have a hunch.Pro: I don't know how,Pro: but I think Bucciarati and the others are somewhere on this train.Pesci: You think?Pesci: You think?!Pro: I'm sure the boss is helping them out somehow.Pro: I have a feeling that if we don't board this train, we'll lose them forever!Pesci: A feeling?Pro: Just shut up and get on, Pesci!Nar: It takes takes three and a half hours to get from Naples to Florence by train.Nar: It's an hour and a half non-stop to the next stop, Rome.Pesci: Aw, we ended up getting on...Pro: Shut up!Pro: Hey, the gap between the door and floor...JoJo-main: ,What's on the other side of this door?Pesci: Isn't that the driver's cab?Pesci: But there's no way seven guys are in there.Pro: You never know.Pro: Use your Fisher Man to att*ck that room.Pro: Do it.Pesci: Fisher Man!Pesci: There aren't seven guys in here...Pesci: There are two!Pesci: Got 'em!Pro: Damn it. It really is small in there.Pro: I guess there's only the driver.JoJo-main: ,But they're definitely somewhere on this train.Pesci: Huh? Hey, wait a second.Pesci: There's only one?Pesci: I know I sensed two living things in there.Pesci: I could've sworn there was one more...Pro: Hey, Pesci!Pro: We're going to search this train from end to end!Pro: We'll drag Bucciarati and his crew out!Pro: But you stay here.Pesci: Huh?Pro: If they realize we're here, they might come to stop the train.Pesci: You got it, Bro!Pro: They have the girl with them,Pro: so they shouldn't be able to just move around or jump off this train easily.Pro: That's going to give us our advantage.Pro: We'll slaughter them all before we get to Rome and take the girl!Bruno: The key wasn't made to fit in a keyhole.JoJo-main: ,It actually fit right into this turtle's shell.Bruno: That, in turn, somehowactivated the turtle's ability,Bruno: creating this space and making the key itself the entrance so that we could hide inside.Nara: Th-The turtle is a Stand user?Nara: O-Ow!Nara: Wh-Where the hell am I?Nara: I'm under the seat?Nara: Ow!Nara: B-But man, this is awesome!Nara: This turtle is like some kind of spaceship!Fugo: But this room isn't some kind of illusion.Fugo: This is a real room.Fugo: Even the sofa and other furniture is real.Abba: There are some chilled drinks in here.Bruno: I guess the boss left them in there for us.Bruno: Turtles like being in the shade, they aren't loud, and they don't scuttle about.Bruno: This way, we should be able to get to Venice by train without worry.Pesci: I guess there's no way someone would be in the locker...Pesci: I just don't have my bro's intuition.Pesci: B-Bro!Pesci: D-Don't tell me he...Pro: The Thankful Death!Pesci: A-Are you really going to do it?JoJo-main: ,You're going to do in all of the passengers?!Pesci: We don't even know if they're on this train!Pro: I already told youPro: that I would be thorough about this!Pro: They're definitely here.JoJo-main: ,What's the big deal, anyway?Pro: Every year, there are lots of train crashes all over the world.Pro: This won't be as brutal as those.Sign: Mr. PresidentSign: Coco LargeMista: It's probably because we're in a room inside a turtle,JoJo-main: ,but it's sorta muggy in here.Mista: You want a drink, too, Narancia?Mista: There are only cold drinks, but there's cola, mineral water,JoJo-main: ,carbonated, non-carbonated, apple juice, orange juice, and pineapple juice.Mista: Hey, are you even listening?Nara: Huh? What was that?!Mista: I'm asking if you want something to drink!Mista: Why don't you get some rest while you're at it?Mista: You look pretty tired.Mista: I'll keep an eye on the ceiling.Nara: Oh, okay!Nara: My shoulders suddenly feel stiff, and my back hurts. There we go...Nara: I'd really like something warm...JoJo-main: ,Something that won't upset my stomach.Mista: I told you, there are only cold drinks in here!Mista: You never listen, do you?!Nara: I'll just eat this banana, then.Nara: Man, gardens like these make me sigh.JoJo-main: ,They're so calming...Nara: They're so beautiful...Nara: I'd love to drown in nostalgia and think back on when I was a kidJoJo-main: ,while I just lay out in the sun in a garden like this.Mista: Hey, stop that!JoJo-main: ,Licking your finger before you turn the page is gross!Nara: Huh? Did I do that?Nara: Me? No way!Mista: Hey, there's something hanging from your mouth.Mista: Talk about gross. What the hell is that?Mista: Hey!Mista: A tooth?Nara: I can't eat this banana for some reason...Nara: It's all hard and dry...Mista: Hey... Are you messing with us?Mista: Man, you startled me... That sort of looks like a tooth.Mista: I'm still pretty grossed out, so I can't really laugh...Mista: What is that hanging from your mouth?Nara: Huh? Did you say something again... Mista?Nara: You're speaking too softly...Nara: I couldn't hear you very well...Nara: I'm telling you, this banana is crumbling...Nara: I-I can't eat it...Nara: Th-They're all dry...JoJo-main: ,A-All the fruits are dry...Mista: Wh-What the hell is wrong with you?!Nara: Didn't you hear me? Okay, then...Mista: There's something wrong with your face!Mista: N-Narancia, you...Nara: I'll say it even louder this time!Nara: Are you paying attention?! I can't eat this banana!Nara: Look. It's just crumbling...Nara: It's old, damn it...Mista: Bucciarati!Bruno: I know! It's a Stand att*ck!Bruno: Th-There must be an enemy on this train!Nara: Huh? What? What's this white stuff?Nara: It came from my head...Nara: What the hell is this?!Gio: What's the matter?Gio: Did something... happen?Bruno: Th-They've all aged!Kid: Mama... Wake up... Wake up...Kid: Mama... Mama...Kid: Wake up...Nara: Wh-Who the hell is th-this?Nara: What? No way... This can't be!Nara: This is me?!Nara: What the hell's going on?Mista: A-A Stand that makes people age?Mista: Did they figure out we're in this turtle?!Bruno: Calm down, Mista.Bruno: If they knew we were inside this turtle, they would've used a more direct att*ck.Bruno: And since they haven't, that means we haven't been found yet.Bruno: The enemy probably only knows that we're somewhere on this trainBruno: and, in order to find her,Bruno: they're attacking everyone on the train indiscriminately!Mista: D-Does that mean this train is running with everyone on board affected?Bruno: Probably.Bruno: They're desperate. I'm sure they'll do anything...Bruno: And without a second thought.Bruno: This leaves us two choices.Bruno: One, take Trish and somehow get off this train.Bruno: Two, we find this enemy, even though we don't know their range, and dispose of them.Mista: Obviously, we'll go with the second choice.Mista: If we want to take her and run,we'll have to stop the train.Mista: It's too dangerous.Mista: Assassinating them is more definitive,Mista: with my Six b*ll*ts!Bruno: Yes, you're right.JoJo-main: ,But we don't have any time.Bruno: We're aging at an alarming rate...Nara: B-Bucciarati...Nara: M-My hands...Nara: Th-They're crumbling!Nara: They're falling apart!mista: You're right, Bucciarati. We really don't have any time!Gio: Wait a minute, Mista...Gio: It's too early... to go...Mista: What the hell are you talking about, Giorno?Gio: I'm telling you... it's too early to go...Mista: We don't have any time to waste!Bruno: Wait.Bruno: Hear him out.JoJo-main: ,What are you trying to say, Giorno?Gio: Why are we all aging at a different rate than Bucciarati?Bruno: Mista's and my symptoms are light...Bruno: Trish's are even less!Bruno: But why?Mista: Apparently, we're just aging at different rates! I'm going!Gio: No... If they're attacking everyone indiscriminately with age...Gio: They might end up k*lling her as well, despite her being the target.Gio: There's some kind of prerequisite to how fast we're aging.Gio: I'll tell you what I think...Gio: I think the enemy is differentiating betweenJoJo-main: ,men and women by the difference in their body temperature.Gio: I read somewhere that women have more fat in their bodies, which makes themJoJo-main: ,less susceptible to temperature fluctuations.Gio: Apparently women also age better and live longer than men.Gio: Don't you think it's been a little hot?Gio: The enemy is differentiating the aging speed based onGio: slight differences in body temperature.Gio: All that matters is that the men age faster and she ages slower.Mista: Yeah, that sounds about right,Mista: but then why are you and I aging at different rates?Mista: Are you insinuating that I'm a girl?!Trish: Change in body temperature...Trish: Come to think of it, our bodies were slightly cooler...Trish: Because we had something cold to drink.Trish: Narancia didn't have anything to drink.Mista: Th-That's...Mista: Giorno, it's exactly like you said!Mista: We're aging slower because our bodies were slightly cooler!Mista: Cool everyone down! Cool everyone down with ice!Bruno: Hold it, Mista!JoJo-main: ,You're going to have to take that ice with you!Mista: Th-This is all that's left?Bruno: It doesn't change the fact that we have to dispose of this enemy.Bruno: Mista, you're going to take that ice and defeat the enemy...Bruno: Before the ice melts and you lose your Stand power!Mista: Just the driver... It doesn't look like anyone else is in here.Mista: It's so muggy...Mista: This Stand really is attacking indiscriminately.Mista: I wonder if this turtle is aging, too...JoJo-main: ,But they say that turtles live for , years.Mista: Guess they live longer than us.Pesci: Damn it...Pesci: What's Bro thinking? This is so dangerous.Pesci: What's he gonna do if I get old, too? Damn it...Mista: The air conditioner?JoJo-main: ,If I turn it on inside the driver's cab, everyone in the turtle will cool down,JoJo-main: ,and that might slow down their aging!JoJo-main: ,There it is!Pesci: Something took the bait!Mista: Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!Mista: A d-different Stand than the one that's aging us?Mista: There's another one? There are two of them?Mista: There are two enemies?!

I have one more request...Five: If you want to send one of us to Bucciarati,JoJo-main: ,I already revived Number Six, and he went on ahead!Five: He took the ice in your pocket andJoJo-main: ,went to tell them that two enemies were heading for the turtle!Misa: That's perfect...

Take this!Pro: What?!Bruno: I will complete this mission,Bruno: and I will also protect my crew.Bruno: It won't be hard for me to do both if I'm only facing the likes of you.Pro: It's fast...Pro: It's definitely fast...Pro: Your... Zipper Man, was it?Pro: It's definitely faster...Pro: But you're the one who doesn't seem to understand speed, Bucciarati!Pro: I seem to be out of breath...Pro: But the same goes for you, Bucciarati.Pro: Since we used our Stands at full speed, we both used up a lot of energy.Pro: You didn't comprehend that and tried to go as fast as you could,Pro: even though you're still agingdespite standing still!Pro: The more horsepower a car has, the warmer it gets!Pro: That's because you're burning calories.JoJo-main: ,You're a smart guy, so I'm sure you can figure out...Pro: what'll happen when your body gets warmer!Six: B-Bucciarati!Six: Th-The ice is starting to lose its effect!Pro: So what are you going to do now, huh?Pro: This zipper you gave me is starting to close.Pro: The zipper on my chin is already gone.Pro: What's the matter?Pro: Exhausted from your stiff shoulders?bruno: Zipper Man!Pro: I can see your movements! You're too slow, Bucciarati!Pro: I've got you! Now you're all finished!Pro: And then we'll be taking the boss's daughter!Bruno: I was aware of what wouldhappen if my body warmed up.Bruno: I was also prepared to get caught.Bruno: I will complete this mission.JoJo-main: ,I will also protect my crew.Bruno: One of the hardest parts of being a capo is the fact that I have to do both.Bruno: Are you prepared?Bruno: I am.Pro: Wha—Pro: Y-You can't mean...Pro: You bastard! You can't be serious!Bruno: Doing both is simple,JoJo-main: ,if I can get you off this train.Bruno: If I can just undo the aging, my five subordinates will be back,Bruno: and we'll be able to protect Trish!Pro: You bastard! Y-You can't be serious! Let go!Pro: We're moving at  kilometers per hour!Bruno: Oh, come on, now. You're the one who grabbed me.Pro: Are you trying to die?! You bastard!

Number Three!Crush,Sfx: FwoooooMista: What?!Mista: A-All I did was blink... and now my eyelashes are stuck together!Gio: He must've waited for this to happen before getting on the roof...Gio: This car is currently going  kilometers per hour.Gio: Which means...JoJo-main: ,It's the same as being stuck in wind blowing at  meters per second.Gio: The effective temperature drops by ° Celsius for every meter of wind velocity,Gio: so we're currently freezing at -° Celsius.Mista: Then stop the damn car!Mista: Why the hell are you still flooring it?!Gio: Yes. I've been trying to stop it.Gio: But the brake pedal is frozen and won't go down!Gio: I'm losing the steering wheel, too.JoJo-main: ,The engine's running and doesn't seem like it's going to stop.Gio: The surface of the car has reached -° Celsius for sure!JoJo-main: ,And at incredible speed! So this is... the enemy's ability!Mista: Th-The blood that was spurting out of my hand froze...Mista: The moisture from my breathing caused my nostrils to freeze together...Mista: And now, my lips...Mista: sh*t!

Why isn't the title Death in Venezia?!Crush,Sfx: Smack Smack SmackGhia: Are you friggin' mocking me?!JoJo-main: ,It takes place in Italy, so use the Italian word, damn it!Ghia: That sh*t pisses me off!Ghia: Bunch of dumbasses!Ghia: Looks like it's finally becoming a bit difficult to drive.Gio: Mista...JoJo-main: ,My Golden Wind needs heat.Gio: So sadly, all I'm really useful for right now...Gio: is picking up b*ll*ts.Ghia: You won't be able to fill the car with any more holes.Ghia: I'll just freeze you to an even lower tem—Mista: When you fire b*ll*ts, they heat up, don't they?Mista: So when I fire the b*ll*ts that Giorno picked up for me...Mista: It creates heat!Mista: I guess I'll go ahead and shout this for Giorno, while I'm at it...Mista: Golden Wind!Mista: We did it!JoJo-main: ,Plant roots have the energy to prop up asphalt in roads and even shatter rocks!Mista: Keep hold of the steering wheel, Giorno!JoJo-main: ,We're gonna get the hell outta here!Crush,Sfx: ShinkGhia: Tch.JoJo-main: ,So that must be the ability of the newbie Melone was talking about.Ghia: But you're not getting away!Mista: Seriously? That bastard!Mista: He's still coming after us!Ghia: I'm gonna be the one who gets his hands on whatever's at the station, no matter what.Ghia: You're wasting your b*ll*ts.JoJo-main: ,My ability, White Ice, freezes the moisture in the air to an extremely low temperature,Ghia: which I then wear like armor.Ghia: This also allows me to skate,JoJo-main: ,but I'm also wrapped in something so strong that even b*ll*ts can't pierce it!Mista: Go faster, Giorno!Gio: I can't go any faster!JoJo-main: ,The tires are still slipping.Gio: Even worse, they found out about the station!Mista: They haven't found out aboutthe turtle where Trish is,Mista: so depending on how you look at it, that's kind of a bright side.Gio: You're always so optimistic, aren't you?Gio: You're very unusual.Mista: He's coming! Floor it! Faster!Gio: I told you, I can't!Gio: If we slip, we're going to lose even more spee—Mista: Just do it, damn it! I said floor it, so floor it!Ghia: I told you! This is useless!Mista: Number Three and Number Two up on the roof, come back!Mista: I hope you get to share a hot, passionate kiss with the road.Mista: Your face will be well-acquainted with it at the speed you're going.All: Yeah!Mista: Good. We managed to lose him.JoJo-main: ,Now get us into the city andhead straight for the station!Mista: Before he can catch up to us, we're going to get our hands on the thing and hide!JoJo-main: ,Giorno!Ghia: You're not getting away!JoJo-main: ,There's no way you guys are going to make it to the station!Mista: He's freezing the moisture from the car's exhaust!Mista: What kind of temperature do you have to freeze it at to do this sh*t?Mista: You bastard! Eat lead again!Mista: He opened the trunk! Which means...Mista: Sh-sh*t! He got into the trunk! Stop the car, Giorno!Mista: He's gonna freeze the brake pedal so it'll be useless again!Ghia: There's no need for that...JoJo-main: ,Gunslinger Mista.Ghia: Seeing as Trish isn't here, this is what I was planning to do in the first place.Ghia: Shatter—Mista: G-Giorno!Gio: It only cracked?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is he invincible?Gio: How can I destroy this armor?Mista: Giorno!

This photo should be a hint...Gio: sh*t. This is the worst possible scenario.Gio: Mista's currently acting out of despair.Gio: He's decided to take responsibility for this, even if it costs him his life.Gio: But the only ones who can open up a pathJoJo-internal/narrator: ,in the darkness are those with resolve.Gio: Things are getting interesting.Gio: We're going to have to make some sacrifices,Gio: but my resolve, as well as Mista's,Gio: will open up a path in the darkness!Sign: GhiaccioSign: White IceGhia: What the hell is this?JoJo-main: ,It was embedded in there?Ghia: In one of the cuts or gaps in the statue?Mista: Damn it!

You're being released.Mista: You're the one who bailed me out?Bruno: Yes. I saw the incident on the news and decided you acted out of self-defense.Bruno: It means you are incredibly skilled with a p*stol and full of life.Bruno: But a guy like you probably wouldn't last two years in prison.Bruno: That's why...Mista: You pulled some strings.Mista: Do you belong to some organization?Bruno: Come with me.JoJo-flashback: ,There's an excellent ristorante nearby.Bruno: I like the way you eat.Bruno: The bruschetta here is great, too. Do you still have some room?Mista: Yeah.Bruno: Pardon me.Guy: Yes, sir?Bruno: Could I get some bruschetta for him... I should get some for them, too.Bruno: Could I get four orders of bruschetta?Bruno: No, make that five.

Everything worked out in the end.Nar: Mista learned that people have predetermined destinies.Nar: When they're young,Nar: people may find themselves at a standstill or taking the long way around at times,Nar: but they ultimately end up traveling the path they were destined to walk.Mista: I can see it!

What am I gonna do?Mista: Yeah, this stain's gonna be hard to get out.Mista: A single drop of wine on a white suit really stands out.Nara: I can't pay for this sh*t!Mista: Well, the location of the stain might make it look like a button.Mista: If he puts a button there, he can hide it.Abba: While we're at it, let's get him to make sure there isn't any poison in our food.Mista: That's a great idea!Bruno: Hey, that's enough.Gio: More importantly...Gio: What's going on with Bucciarati right now?Gio: After that battle with the boss, Bucciarati's heart definitely stopped.Gio: And when he got hurt back there, there wasn't a single drop of blood.Gio: What about now?Gio: But right now isn't the best time to find out.Gio: I'll keep this secret to myself for now.Abba: So, Bucciarati, what are we going to do now?Bruno: The boss's Stand makes time disappear,Bruno: and the boss is the only one who can move freely in that state.Bruno: He's invincible.Bruno: It doesn't matter who it is.Bruno: Anyone's att*ck becomes useless before that Stand.Bruno: However...Bruno: That'll change once we find out who the boss is!Bruno: Because if we find out the boss's identity,Bruno: we might be able to assassinate him.Bruno: And to do that, we need to find outBruno: who he really is.Mista: But how are we going to find him?Mista: The boss is the type of guy who's gotten rid of any trace of himself.Abba: Trish.Abba: There must be some kind of hint involving Trish.Abba: Everyone was after Trish, and the boss was trying to eliminate Trish.Abba: Right?Nara: A-About that...Nara: I don't really want to involve Trish in this anymore...Nara: Th-This feeling sucks.Nara: Trish doesn't know anything!Nara: If she finds out her actual father tried to k*ll her, she'll be in shock.Nara: Bucciarati, please!Nara: Let's not talk about the boss's identity and stuff like that in front of her.Trish: There's no need for that, Narancia.Trish: I've already known that... for a while.Nara: T-Trish...Trish: I remembered something when you said he got rid of any trace of himself.Trish: My mother had mentioned that she met my father in Sardinia.Bruno: Sardinia...Trish: When I was little, my mother told meTrish: that they had met while she was vacationing,Trish: and he told her he'd be right back...Trish: But then he disappeared forever,leaving nothing behind,Trish: not even a photo or his name.Abba: Before he became the boss of the organization...Abba: Fifteen years ago...Abba: Then was he born and raised in...Trish: I'm not sure about all that, but...Trish: Sardinia. His past and true identity should be in Sardinia.Bruno: Why are you telling us that?Bruno: We might end up k*lling your father!Bruno: No, we are determined to defeat him!Trish: You defeating him or not isn't my problem.Trish: But... I want to know!Trish: I want to know who I came from!Trish: I'm not about to die before I find that out!Abba: Hey, Narancia.Abba: Looks like she's way stronger than you thought.Nara: Fine.Gio: Sardinia...Gio: That's our next destination after we escape from Venice.Gio: That's where we'll find out who the boss really is.Nara: I was under the impression that Trish was like me,Nara: but I guess she'd already made up her mind.Nara: I just followed on a whim, so I still don't knowNara: if there's any hope in this trip or not.Nara: Huh?Nara: An enemy! There's an enemy nearby!Nara: There's a shark in my soup!Nara: Li'l Bomber!Bruno: Giorno! Get Trish inside the turtle!Bruno: Abbacchio, cover the right! Mista, guard the left!Mista: Where, Narancia? Where are they?Nara: Inside the soup! They were somehow already in it!Mista: Where are they now?Nara: But they were there!Nara: There was something like a shark in my soup!Mista: I don't see anything strange about it.Mista: Does that mean we lost them?Crunch,Sfx: SwooshBruno: Narancia!Mista: What happened?!Mista: Narancia! Were you att*cked somewhere?Mista: Where did they get you?Mista: Narancia, what's wrong? What's there?!Mista: I'm asking you what's wrong, Narancia!Bruno: Hold it, Mista. I don't think Narancia can talk...Mista: What? You can't talk?Mista: What's wrong, Narancia? What are you pointing at?Mista: Water? You want a sip of water?Mista: H-Hey! Th-This is bad! Look!Mista: Narancia's tongue! It's gone!Mista: On top of that, I don't think he's breathing!Gio: This isn't good.Gio: I can use Golden Wind to create parts for his tongue,Gio: but it'll take time to finish.Mista: Hey, come on! He's about to suffocate here!Gio: Mista, do you have a pen?Mista: A pen?! Y-Yeah, I have one...Crunch,Sfx: s*abMista: Looks like he's breathing.Gio: I'll give life to this pen to create parts for his tongue.Gio: That way, he can breathe while I create his tongue.Squalo: I see...Squalo: So that's Giorno Giovanna.Tiziano: Now I'm starting to understand the information the boss gave us.Tiziano: We're going to have to be the most careful around that newbie kid.Squalo: Yeah... I'm a bit surprised he saved Narancia.Squalo: I thought my Crush would be enough for this job,Squalo: but apparently, I'm going to need your help eliminating all five of them,Squalo: Tiziano.Tiziano: As the boss's elite guards, we're going to have to defeat him here.Tiziano: Are you ready, Squalo?Squalo: All according to plan.Squalo: As long as we can lure them to water, Crush is invincible.Squalo: Our plan will decide everything.Squalo: We'll take care of them one at a time, Tiziano.Tiziano: Yeah, Squalo...Tiziano: We'll use Narancia.Sign: CrushSign: SqualoBruno: Are you all right, Narancia?Nara: Yeah...Nara: You guys saved me.Bruno: What did you see?Bruno: How did the enemy Stand att*ck?Nara: It... c-came from the soup...Gio: Narancia, don't force it.Nara: I-I'm fine. I can talk.Mista: Hey, Narancia, what's the enemy like?Mista: Where'd he run off to?Nara: He was...Nara: He was like a pebble!Nara: He was huge, and he ran into the restaurant!Mista: Huh? Huge like a pebble?Mista: But earlier, you were saying it was in your soup!Mista: You're contradicting yourself.Nara: Huh? Did I just say that?Mista: So, then... is the enemy about this big?Nara: Nope.Nara: Huh? No, wait!Mista: Then, like, this big?Nara: U-Um...Mista: No? Then, like, this big?Nara: Yup, exactly.Mista: So something this big was in your soup,Mista: and it went running into the restaurant?Nara: Yup.Nara: Huh? What?Bruno: We can't get a clear picture of this enemy at all.Bruno: Does that mean it was really fast?Nara: Nope! It was slow!Bruno: What?Mista: Huh?!Mista: If it was huge and slow, why didn't we see it?Mista: Did you actually see a Stand?Nara: Of course I did... n—Mista: You keep contradicting yourself!Mista: You're not trying to act tough because the enemy got you, are you?Nara: I... I...Mista: Answer me, damn it! You didn't actually see anything, did you?Nara: Of course I did...Nara: not...Mista: So you didn't actually see anything, after all!Mista: This is no time to screw around!Abba: There's no one suspicious nearby.Abba: Apparently, it's a remote-controlled Stand.Gio: That must mean that the user is watching us from somewhere.Gio: In that case, we should leave here immediately.Nara: Let's follow the channel out to the sea.Nara: Yeah, Giorno!Nara: Let's do it! Let's use the channel!Gio: Yes, Narancia. That's what I just...Gio: Narancia?Mista: Narancia, why do you keep covering your mouth?Mista: Let me see it.Mista: What the hell? It's completely normal.Nara: Yup! I'm totally fine!Nara: There's no problem at all, Mista!Abba: So, what are we going to do, Bucciarati?Abba: Are we going out to sea?Bruno: No. Let's not follow the channel just yet.Bruno: This is our chance.Bruno: We're going to use it to defeat that enemy!Bruno: The boss wasn't expecting our betrayal,Bruno: which means there probably aren't that many members of his elite guard here.Bruno: If we defeat him now,Bruno: I'm sure we'll be able to get through the seas of Venice just fine.Mista: I see. You have a point. I agree.Abba: Yeah, I agree.Gio: Very well, Bucciarati.Gio: If you say so.Bruno: Abbacchio, could you use your Moody Jazz to replay what happened?Abba: Yeah, sure.Abba: Where do you want to start?Abba: From when the soup was still on the table?Bruno: Yeah.Abba: What the hell, Narancia?Nara: Guys! The enemy's right over there!Abba: Over there? You mean inside the restaurant's bathroom?Mista: Narancia, you damn well better have seen something this time!Nara: Yup, I did!Bruno: After them. We'll settle things with this enemy here and now.Mista: Come on, Giorno. Let's go.Gio: Right...Squalo: Well done, Narancia.Squalo: None of his friends realize that there's another StandSqualo: besides Crush, which travels from liquid to liquid.Tiziano: Yes, they don't realize that my Stand,Tiziano: Talking Mouth, is attached to your tongue and making you sayTiziano: the exact opposite of what you mean.Squalo: All right, I'm gonna go k*ll the rest of them. Grazie.Crunch,Sfx: {\fad(,)\shad\c&HDDB&}Sc{\c&HFD&}hw{\c&HBD&}in{\c&HEADC&}gNara: S-So that's what was going on! Damn it!Nara: They were using me to get everyone near the water, one by one.Nara: How dare you underestimate me?!Mista: I don't sense anyone here...abba: Let's at least figure out what the enemy looks like.Abba: Moody Jazz!Abba: Transform into whoever was in here a few dozen seconds ago, and pursue them!Gio: Narancia!Nara: Seeing who the enemy is through Moody Jazz is fine,Nara: but don't pursue them!Nara: If it gets into water, they don't stand a chance!Nara: In that case, I'll do everything I can to keep them away from water!Abba: Over here...Abba: Moody Jazz is transforming.Nara: Water's bad news! Don't look in there!Nara: Look at me! Look in here!Abba: What the hell? That's disgusting!Nara: Come over here, Abbacchio!Nara: Look in here!Abba: What are you talking about? Have you turned into some kind of pervert?Mista: We're trying to investigate because you said you saw the enemy in here!Mista: Did you really see them in here?Nara: Of course, I—Abba: Seriously, what is your problem?Abba: Bucciarati, there's a chance Narancia was just seeing things in here.Aba: We might be better off looking at the table if we want to pursue them.Bruno: Yeah.Mista: Cut the crap, Narancia!Mista: I'm not gonna let you take us all down!Gio: Narancia, what happened to your finger?Gio: Did you snag it somewhere?Gio: Here, I'll stop the bleeding.Nara: That bastard's going to try to use my blood to move.Nara: N-No! S-Stay back, Giorno!Nara: Yeah! Fix me right up, Giorno!Giorno: There's definitely something strange.Giono: Is something wrong with the inside of your mouth?Gio: They att*cked your tongue earlier. Does that have anything to do with it?Nara: Great job, Giorno! You're so intuitive.Nara: Just a little more...Nara: Just a little more, and Giorno will figure it out.Gio: But you're bleeding really badly.Gio: First, let's take care of that wound.Gio: Now, let me see it.Nara: No! You can't touch the blood!Gio: Come on, Narancia.Nara: This is bad! Stay back!Gio: Hurry!Nara: Li'l Bomber!Nar: Damn it...Gio: Narancia,Gio: you seem to be under att*ck by something,Gio: but there must be some reason you can't tell us the truth.Nara: Yes! He figured it out!Gio: Was there something left in your mouth from the first att*ck?Gio: Like, an ability that makes you say the opposite of what you mean?Nara: Yes! That's it, Giorno!Nara: Sh-sh*t! There's water from the pipe!Nara: Giorno!
04x23 - Clash and Talking Head / Crush and Talking MouthQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/24/23 10:13Squalo: None of his friends realize that there's another Stand.Tiziano: Yes, they don't realize that my Stand,Tiziano: Talking Mouth, is attached to your tongue and making you sayTiziano: the exact opposite of what you mean.Gio: Narancia,Gio: there must be some reason you can't tell us the truth.Nara: Giorno!Nara: Giorno's getting pulled under!Nara: Even though the water's so shallow!Nara: Li'l Bomber!Nara: The bastard is teleporting from liquid to liquidNara: while still holding on to Giorno's body,Nara: despite there being so little water!Squalo: Yes! I got him.Squalo: If we first take care of Giorno Giovanna, who controls life and can heal his friends,Squalo: it'll be a piece of cake to eliminate the rest of his friends one by one.Tiziano: Yeah, it's all going according to plan.Tiziano: But we should finish off Giorno immediately, Squalo.Squalo: Huh?Tiziano: According to my information, Narancia's Li'l Bomber can track carbon dioxide.Tiziano: Even though Giorno's unconscious right now,Tiziano: if he's breathing, your Crush, which bit into him, will be tracked down.Tiziano: Even if you jump from liquid to liquid.Tiziano: It won't be good if Li'l Bomber tracks down your location and gets ahead.Tiziano: It'll track us down.Squalo: All right, Tiziano.Squalo: I'll stop Giorno's breathing.Squalo: Right now.JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio  Crush and Talking MouthNara: This isn't good.Nara: I can't let them take Giorno away!Gio: This enemy...Gio: So there were already two Stands here?Nara: sh*t! The more I miss,Nara: the more I'm spreading the water around and giving them the upper hand!Nara: I have to get ahead of them!Nara: Where are they? Where'd they go?!Nara: There!Nara: They may be able to teleport, but if I can get ahead of them,Nara: I can fill them full of holes!Tiziano: He's got his radar out.Tiziano: As I figured, he's going to try to track us down and sh**t us.Tiziano: We should stop Giorno's breathing immediately.Squalo: Quit being so pushy. I know, Tiz.Squalo: But it sure is hard to att*ck Giorno while teleporting!Nara: I got the timing down! Now!Nara: Wha— Into his neck?!Nara: Giorno! I-I didn't mean to sh**t you!Nara: Wh-What? His breathing...Nara: The symbol indicating Giorno's breathing...Nara: It disappeared from the radar!Nara: sh*t! They got away!Squalo: Excellent. Crush went into the sewers.Squalo: I'm just going to continue down into the canal and dispose of Giorno's body.Tiziano: Hold it. What was that, Squalo?Squalo: I said I'd take his body to the canal and...Tizi: No, I'm talking about Narancia.Tizi: I almost didn't hear it, but he definitely said it!Tizi: He said, "They got away!" With his voice!Tizi: As long as my Talking Mouth is on his tongue,Tizi: he should only be able to say the opposite of his intent.Tizi: But he said, "They got away!"Tizi: He even said the radar symbol disappeared.Tizi: Squalo! Move from there immediately!Squalo: What are you talking about, Tiziano?Squalo: Giorno's not breathing at all!Squalo: There's no one else who can track down my Crush!Tizi: He said, "They got away!" on purpose!Tizi: It was to put you at ease!Tizi: It was to stop Crush's teleportation for even a moment!Tizi: I don't know how, but he's definitely tracking you!Nara: Back then, Giorno moved on purpose so I'd sh**t him.Nara: That way, there'd be residue from the g*nshots, and I could actually track him!Nara: I can see him.Nara: I can see him clear as day!Nara: Here we go! I'm gonna fill them with holes!Nara: Here I come, you bastard!Nara: This means Giorno's not dead yet!Nara: If we can resuscitate him within a few minutes, he'll be saved!Tizi: This isn't good, Squalo!Tizi: Now that he's fired at you twice,Tizi: he's going to go after the residue from your b*llet wounds!Nara: I did it! I got him out of the sewers!Abba: It's no use, Bucciarati.Abba: I can't replay this enemy any further.Abba: I know for sure that they were in this cup on top of this table.Abba: But they were only there for a moment.Abba: From there, Moody Jazz can't transform, nor go forward.Bruno: What do you mean, Abbacchio?Abba: I don't know. Maybe they can teleport.Abba: But I don't have the answer.Abba: The replay for this enemy...Abba: It won't go any further, like a video tape that's been torn.Squalo: I can't believe Narancia would go this far...Tizi: No, it's Giorno.Tizi: This all happened because Giorno intentionally got sh*tTizi: by Li'l Bomber's g*ns.Squalo: sh*t! I can't get rid of the residue!Squalo: Even in the water!Squalo: Because the b*ll*ts were from a Stand.Squalo: I have to disappear somehow.Squalo: Somewhere he can't detect me!Nara: I've been watching...Nara: and this shark bastard is pretty damn fast for a remote-controlled Stand,Nara: but it looks like it can't get very far in a single leap.Nara: Looks to be about two to three meters!Squalo: sh*t!Squalo: H-His att*cks are becoming more precise!Nara: It could be due to injuries, but their speed's getting slower!Tizi: Squalo!Nara: Yes! Now I just need to end this with a finishing blow!Nara: Take this, you fishy bastard!Nara: Th-This smell...Nara: There's a gas leak!Squalo: This is all according to plan, Narancia.Squalo: Because you sh*t,Squalo: hot water spilled from the potand extinguished the burner.Squalo: Now Li'l Bomber won't be able to sh**t its g*ns!Squalo: Now you can't track me!Squalo: If one of the sparks from your g*n happens to ignite the gas,Squalo: you may survive, but everything around there will burn,Squalo: filling the room with carbon dioxide, and you won't be able to find me anymore!Squalo: Narancia, just go ahead and try to sh**tSqualo: those g*ns!Squalo: We've won!Nara: You know, if I can't sh**t...Nara: I have other ways of k*lling you!Nara: Yes! I got the enemy!Nara: Bucciarati! Mista! The enemy's here!Nara: Abbacchio, the enemy's able to move from liquid to liquid!Nara: Giorno's breathing again!Nara: Huh?Nara: Wait. What did I just say?Nara: Why was I able to speak the truth?Tizi: Squalo, I've released Talking Mouth from Narancia's tongue,Tizi: just like you planned.Tizi: You're pretty badly injured, but I'm sure the boss will be satisfied.Mista: Did you just yell something, Narancia?!Abba: Did you say the enemy's over here?Tizi: But the release of Talking Mouth is only temporary.Mista: Giorno's... That must be the enemy!Nara: Wh-What?!Nara: W-Wai—Tizi: We win, Squalo.Tizi: Yes... This is all according to plan!Mista: Here we go, Six b*ll*ts!Nara: sh**t, Mista!Mista: Wh-What?!Nara: Sh-sh*t! My radar!Nara: I can't track them! They're going to att*ck!Nara: Giorno's going to be taken because of my lie!Gio: N-Narancia!Gio: L-Look for it!Nara: G-Giorno!Gio: Don't go after the Stand...Gio: Go after the user!Nara: Giorno!Mista: Hey, Narancia!Mista: You bastard! Why'd you tell me to sh**t?!Mista: This room was filled with gas!Nara: Look out! It's the enemy! The enemy's above!Nara: No! Below! The enemy's below!Mista: What?!Nara: Guys!Nara: It's no use! I can't stop myself from talking!Nara: I have to stop talking!Nara: It disappeared!Nara: They're planning to eliminate Giorno before anyone else!Gio: Don't go after the Stand...Gio: Go after the user!Nara: Giorno!Nara: Giorno told me to find the user.Nara: Right... They're hurt.Nara: Because they're hurt, their breathing is probably labored.Nara: So that's what he means.Nara: He wants me to use my radar to find them.Nara: I'm alone in this. I have to do this alone.Nara: Someone who's breathing hard...Nara: They have a remote-controlled Stand,Nara: but they have to be somewhere around here.Nara: There's no time! I have to be quick and find them!Sign: Talking MouthSign: TizianoTizi: Okay, this is all according to plan.Tizi: With Giorno gone, there's no one to fix their injuries.Tizi: Now, finish off Giorno.Tizi: For good.Squalo: Yeah, I'll do it.Squalo: I've been injured,Squalo: but I have plenty of strength left to att*ck him.Squalo: Hey, look. It's Narancia.Squalo: What's he doing out here?Tizi: Where is Crush right now?Squalo: Over there.Squalo: It exited the restaurant's sewer pipe and is heading down the canal.Squalo: He shouldn't be able to track it anymore...Squalo: Don't tell me he's trying to find me instead!Squalo: My breathing...Tizi: Calm down, Squalo.Tizi: That's impossible.Tizi: He's just struggling because he's run out of options.Tizi: How many people do you think there are within hundred meters of here?Tizi: Fifty? A hundred?Tizi: There's no way he could tell you apart from the others.Squalo: But I'm injured.Squalo: If he's trying to find someone with labored breathing...Tizi: Don't panic, Squalo.Tizi: Look at the bottom of the stairs.Tizi: There are many with even more labored breathing than you in that square.Tizi: Calm yourself and your breathing.Tizi: If we hide your injuries and head into the square like nothing's wrong, we'll be safe.Tizi: We still win!Squalo: Yeah, you're right... You're exactly right.Squalo: There's no way he'd find us.Nara: I found you!Nara: You're right there!Squalo: Wh-What?!Squalo: sh*t! I have to retrieve Crush!Tizi: Calm down, Squalo! Think this through!Tizi: He can only say the opposite of what he's thinking right now.Tizi: He said he found us, meaning he hasn't found us!Tizi: Don't forget that!Squalo: Then why did he bother saying that?!Tizi: He wants you to panic and make your breathing even more labored!Tizi: Please calm down. If you panic, it's exactly what he wants.Tizi: There's no way Narancia can single you out.Tizi: This is just his futile, last-ditch attempt.Tizi: Calm your breathing.Nara: I found you...Nara: There you are.Nara: I finally... found you.Squalo: He said it again!Tizi: Please, calm down.Tizi: He hasn't found us. That's fact.Tizi: He's definitely lying!Tizi: My Talking Mouth is still definitely on his tongue...Squalo: H-Hey, look!Tizi: Wh-What?!Squalo: He cut out his own tongue!Squalo: With his own Kn*fe!Tizi: That's impossible!Tizi: No one can survive after cutting out their own tongue,Tizi: let alone speak!Nara: I found... you!Tizi: H-He has another tongue!Tizi: The ladybug became a tongue!Tizi: It can't be!Squalo: It's Giorno!Squalo: Giorno Giovanna!Squalo: Just as the boss had said, he's the biggest problem!Squalo: That bastard Giorno must've created a tongueSqualo: for Narancia in the kitchen and given it to him!Squalo: He's coming! He's heading this way!Squalo: So he was tracking my breathing!Tizi: It's the opposite!Tizi: If he was actually tracking you, he would've att*cked already!Nara: Considering the number of people out here, there's all kinds of breathing.Nara: Labored breathing, slow breathing...Nara: There's so much that I can't single anyone out.Nara: But I've been waiting...Nara: I've been waiting for this...Nara: For the moment when someone's breathing drastically changes suddenly!Nara: For someone to change their breathing drasticallyNara: after seeing me cut my tongue out with a Kn*fe!Nara: For someone to see their Stand hanging out along with my tongueNara: and panic bigtime!Nara: That's what I've been waiting for!Nara: Just when I thought I'd lost you guys and was about to give up!Nara: You, over there!Nara: Your breathing just fluctuated, didn't it?!Nara: Yeah, you! I'm talking to you!Nara: I'm talking to you, long hair!Tizi: This can't be!Tizi: He actually cut out his tongue to track me!Nara: Which must mean the shark user is the dude next to you!Nara: He seems pretty damn pale.Tizi: Squalo, retrieve Crush!Squalo: I'm already on it!Squalo: It's traveling through the sewers and heading toward that well.Squalo: But... there's no water here!Squalo: There's no liquid that Crush can jump at Narancia from!Nara: You must be him!Nara: The guy who dragged Giorno away!Squalo: Tiziano!Tizi: Now you have some liquid... Squalo.Tizi: This didn't... go exactly according to plan...Tizi: But this doesn't change our victory.Tizi: We're still going to... win...Squalo: I don't give a damn about the boss's orders anymore.Squalo: I'm not going to k*ll you because I was ordered to as one of the elite guard.Squalo: Tiziano... I'm going to eliminate him for you!Squalo: I'll k*ll all of Narancia's friends, too!Squalo: I'll rip them to pieces and make them pay!Squalo: I'll make them all pay!Squalo: Crush! Rip out his throat!Nara: Do you think... I'm going to falter?Nara: Because of... Because of something like this?Nara: We're...Nara: going to get the hell out of Venice,Nara: completely safe and sound.Nara: See ya...Nara: Volare via.Rome___a_m_,Nara: "Go flying"Squalo: You're a damn traitor...Squalo: You're supposed to be eliminated by the boss...Squalo: You're supposed to have no choice but to fear your future...Squalo: What in the world is driving them forward?Squalo: Why does it seem like they have hope?Squalo: Wh-What could it...Guy: Someone just collapsed!Nara: Giorno!Nara: Y-Yes!

You're going by what was in a movie?Bruno: Abbacchio, how long until takeoff?Abba: No idea. I can't exactly fast forward this.Abba: It'll probably take around ten minutes.Trish: Bucciarati's leg... Was it injured in the restaurant battle?Trish: Still, despite how deep that cut looks, he's barely bleeding.Nara: Up front, to the left! Something's coming!Nara: Something's heading our way, Mista!Mista: Stop right there!Mista: Just so you know,JoJo-main: ,anyone who gets near this plane will be sh*t dead, even if they're a saint!Mista: And it's not like a saint would even come here.Mista: If you care about your well-being at all,JoJo-main: ,you'll turn your back to this plane and get the hell off this runway!Mista: Apparently your ears are plugged up with wax, but do your best to listen.Mista: I'll warn you one last time.Mista: I'll let you go, so get the hell off this runway.Nara: He's a Stand user!Mista: Six b*ll*ts!Mista: Giorno! Narancia! Be careful of the enemy!Nara: His signal disappeared.Nara: He's the only enemy in the area.Nara: No one else is trying to get near this plane.Mista: Giorno! As you can see, he d*ed instantly.Mista: There's no need to check up on him.Gio: Yes, I know, but we need to be cautious.Gio: He went down surprisingly easily.Gio: It's like he showed up only to be defeated.Mista: Hey, are you mocking me and my b*ll*ts?Mista: It just means that he was no match for me!Mista: He's obviously way weaker!b*ll*ts: Yeah! Yeah!Gio: He's completely dead.Gio: Not only is he not breathing, but his heartbeat and life energy are gone, too.Nara: Mista! Giorno! We're taking off! Hurry up and get on!Mista: Come on, Giorno. Let's go.Trish: I wonder if my father...JoJo-main: ,No, your bossTrish: might have guessed that I'd go to Sardinia to find out about the past.Bruno: Former.Bruno: Our former boss.Bruno: I'm sure the thought crossed his mind.Bruno: That's why we need to find out about the boss's past as soon as possible.Bruno: I figure that when he met your mother in Sardinia,Bruno: he wasn't a gangster who needed to hide his identity yet.JoJo-main: ,He was just an ordinary young man.Bruno: He became a gangster after that.Bruno: He must have some kind of identity.Bruno: The true identity of the boss from fifteen years ago surely exists.Bruno: As his daughter, you should be able to track it down.Bruno: Something, anything...JoJo-main: ,Do you remember anything more detailed from your mother's stories of the past?Trish: Cala di Volpe.Bruno: Cala di Volpe... The fox's tail?Trish: It's a resort located in a beautiful, emerald green coastal area.Trish: My mother mentioned that she met my father there while on vacation.Trish: She also mentioned that my father grew up in Sardinia.Trish: Apparently, he spoke with a Sardinian dialect.Trish: But then he disappeared, and my mother never found out more than that...JoJo-main: ,Not even his name.Trish: I'm not even sure what I should look for.Trish: Besides, this is all just from my mother's reminiscing.Bruno: You're the boss's only living relative.Bruno: That's why he's trying to eliminate you.Bruno: Cala di Volpe...Bruno: That means we have our destination.Gio: Mista.Gio: Get your g*n out and take aim.Gio: Listen to this sound...mista: Sound? You mean the sound of the engine?mista: What are you talking about?Gio: Just please, get your g*n out. There's something weird about this cabinet.Mista: Hey, hey, hey, hey...Mista: The only one being weird is you.Mista: You're the one who said there wasn't so much as a cockroach on this plane.Gio: That's true... I don't feel any life energy, even now.Gio: But...Mista: But what?JoJo-main: ,Are you trying to say there's a remote-controlled Stand on the plane?Mista: You sure you're not just freaking out?Gio: I could very well just be freaking out.Gio: But I know I heard something.Gio: I have a bad feeling about this.Gio: I'm going to open this. Please have your g*n ready.Gio: A freezer...JoJo-main: ,I-I apologize. I was getting a little too high-strung.Mista: Giorno, what the hell kind of joke is this?JoJo-main: ,When did you put that in there?Mista: You're trying to scare me with chicken scraps?JoJo-main: ,What the hell's so funny about that?Mista: Th-That's not chicken.JoJo-main: ,It's still wet. Th-The blood's still fresh.Mista: Aren't these the fingers of the fatty I blasted back at the airport?Mista: Giorno, am I wrong?Gio: Calm down, Mista.Mista: Hey... Is there another one now?Bruno: You two. Is something wrong?Bruno: Giorno, you confirmed that there weren't any signs of life on this plane.Bruno: But Mista is saying that it looked like those fingers increased from three to four.Bruno: Is there any life energy in those fingers?Gio: They are just bones. They have no life.Gio: If these bones had any signs of life or were a Stand,JoJo-main: ,plant life from Golden Wind's powers wouldn't grow from them.mista: It freaked me out because it looked like there was one more,JoJo-main: ,so I could've just been seeing things...mista: But there's still something really off about this!Bruno: Indeed.Bruno: I'm not sure how or why, but someone put these in here on purpose.Bruno: Let's throw these outside.Nara: Huh?! But opening the door is super dangerous!Nara: Apparently, the difference in air pressure would send us flying like some rat in a toilet!Bruno: Everyone, hang on to something.Bruno: Zipper Man!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HFFB&\c&H&\shad}PopBruno: Guess you didn't need to hang on after all.Bruno: Anything else out of the ordinary?Bruno: Check every inch of this plane.Gio: I want some pizza, too.Gio: I want to go back to Naples and enjoy a simple Margherita...Gio: This jet looks like a train station bathroom.Gio: But it must be some rich guy's jet...Gio: What the hell is this?Gio: The enemy Stand's name is...Gio: Notorious Chase.Gio: Who wrote all this, and when?Gio: Who the hell wrote this?!Gio: What?!Gio: Th-These fingers...Gio: I-It can't be! We threw the finger bones outside!Gio: We didn't even touch them!Gio: Is this what made that graffiti?Gio: A corpse?Gio: B-But this can't be... The Stand ability of someone who's dead?Gio: Is this thing getting bigger by consuming my body?Gio: Golden Wind!Gio: Cut off my right arm!Gio: What?!Gio: It's consuming my arm in the same shape.Gio: My Stand... is being consumed!GIO: The one who was scribbling on the wall was me...Gio: The one who brought the fingers onto the plane... was me!Bruno: What's going on, Giorno?Mista: H-Hey...Gio: Golden Wind!Mista: You should probably make a new right arm fast, Giorno.Gio: Was he trying to jump onto Golden Wind's right arm just now?Bruno: What's going on, Giorno? This is unthinkable!Gio: We've never dealt with a Stand like this before.JoJo-main: ,It goes against all we know.Bruno: A Stand... Does that mean the user is hiding somewhere?Gio: The user isn't here.Gio: He's already dead. He d*ed on the runway.Gio: That man came here specifically to die...JoJo-main: ,so that his Stand could automatically trace us.Gio: Its energy is still alive.JoJo-main: ,It appears to be a Stand that only activates when its user has d*ed.Gio: There's no user, so it can keep up with this jet's speed.Nara: But it's super slow, Giorno.Nara: Actually, it's not moving at all. Did it die?mista: It's not moving?JoJo-main: ,No, Narancia...mista: It's eating, so it doesn't have to move right now.mista: I got too close. This thing is fast.Mista: My b*ll*ts...Mista: It got four of them just now... That's more than half.b*ll*ts: Number Two! Three! Six! Seven!Mista: This thing's seriously bad news!Mista: Don't get too close.Mista: Everyone, stay back.Nara: Mista!Bruno: sh*t! Don't get close to it!Gio: For some reason, it changed its target to Narancia.Gio: It's using some criteria to decide who to att*ck.Nara: How dare you underestimate me?!Nara: I just need to stay away from it, right?Nara: But...JoJo-main: ,My L'il Bomber can blow this thing apart without getting close at all!Gio: That movement... It's definitely tracking something.Nara: I-Impossible! It's fast! It's way too fast!Nara: This isn't good! At this rate, it's going to att*ck all of us!Bruno: N-Narancia!Bruno: Trish! Hide inside the closet!Bruno: What?!Runo: Why is it going after Trish?!Bruno: Hurry up and shut the door!Trish: I-I won't make it in time!Bruno: Trish!Gio: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Gio: I figured out...JoJo-main: ,what it's tracking.Gio: It's movement!JoJo-main: ,This Stand reacts to movement and prioritizes attacking whatever moves!Gio: It matches the speed of the fastest target and prioritizes it.Gio: If we can get this thing off the plane along with my left arm,Gio: we'll get to Sardinia safely.Gio: Then everything will go as planned.Bruno: Giorno, wait!JoJo-main: ,Who's going to heal your wounds if you lose both your arms?Bruno: Swap with me! Get that Stand onto me!Gio: We won't make it in time, Bucciarati!Gio: It's climbing up higher!Bruno: D-Don't!Bruno: Giorno!Bruno: How can this be?JoJo-main: ,We haven't even gotten to Sardinia yet,b*llet: Mista!Bruno: and both Mista and Narancia are...Bruno: How can this be?Bruno: If we weren't in an enclosed space like this,JoJo-main: ,they might not have been so badly injured.Bruno: My idea to board a plane was naïve...Trish: No one could've predicted this.Trish: And it's because we're on a planeJoJo-main: ,that we were able to blow that Stand away.Bruno: Regardless, we have to tend to their wounds.Bruno: They're all gravely injured.JoJo-main: ,Let's get them inside the turtle.Trish: Hang on a second.Trish: Tend to their wounds... Their wounds...Trish: Giorno's arms...JoJo-main: ,They can be healed, right?Trish: With Golden Wind's powers...Bruno: Golden Wind and Zipper Man's powers activate once their fists hit or touch something.Bruno: This is the most damage we've endured so far.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna is no longer able to fight.Bruno: That probably goes for Mista and Narancia, as well.Bruno: Giorno can't recreate the arms that he's lost!Bruno: Trish, you should get some rest.Bruno: I'm going to go tell Abbacchio.Trish: I'm...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,heading to Sardinia for myself.Trish: Just for my own safety...Trish: And...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,For my future, I want to find the key to my father.Trish: But Giorno and the others are different.Trish: They're making decisions based onJoJo-internal/narrator: ,what they think is right, not for their future or safety.Trish: I...JoJo-main: ,can't even begin to understand that.Trish: Was that... a ball?Trish: A ball was rolling around?Trish: I-Impossible!Tirsh: It didn't get blown away by the plane's speed?Trish: No, it's the opposite...Trish: Giorno...Gio: It's movement!JoJo-flashback: ,This Stand reacts to movement and prioritizes attacking whatever moves!Trish: In that case, the plane is moving through the sky...Trish: The faster something is, the more it prioritizes catching it!Trish: It att*cked the Kn*fe just now because I dropped it...Trish: I want to run into the closet and shut the door.Trish: Slowly...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I have to move slowly...Trish: I have to escape without any sudden movement.Trish: I-It's so sensitive!Trish: Why did it change direction?Trish: It must've reacted to something.Trish: That's... Giorno's brooch?Trish: Could that brooch be...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,alive?Trish: Golden Wind... No, Giorno's arms...Tirsh: H-His left hand?Trish: C-Could it be forming his left hand?Trish: Before Giorno cut off his arm, he used Golden Wind to give the ladybug lifeTrish: and created the hand he lost.Trish: Giorno's not out of the game yet!Trish: If I can protect that left hand,Trish: Narancia and Mista's wounds can also be healed!Trish: B-But how am I going to do that?!

This is why blood relations are so troublesome.Diavolo: It wouldn't be concerning if it involved a stranger,Diavolo: but once blood relations are involved, things become tricky.Diavolo: But that's all it is.Diavolo: It's just a blood relation. If I can get rid of that,Diavolo: I'll be able to remain in the prime of my life.Diavolo: Several days ago, after Pericolo secured Trish,Diavolo: the traitors who were after her scoured this apartment that Trish and her mother lived in,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,but none of them noticed.Diavolo: Every morning of her life,Trish awoke in this house...Diavolo: And...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Every day, she looked at this picture that her mother had lovingly put up.Diavolo: But this date... There's no doubt about it.Diavolo: It's fifteen years ago.Diavolo: This portrait... Even I almost missed it.Diavolo: To think that such a thing existed...Diavolo: Their plane crashed... but they're alive.Diavolo: I can feel it...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,My daughter's Stand abilities have awakened.Diavolo: I can also tell that she's alive and heading to Sardinia.Diavolo: And if it was Abbacchio's Moody Jazz that was flying the plane,Diavolo: that means he's also alive, at the very least.Diavolo: I can't let Moody Jazz go to the spot in this picture.Diavolo: Trish might not realize it right now, but she'll surely rememberDiavolo: the existence of this picture.Diavolo: And if she goes to Sardinia, she'll figure outDiavolo: that the person who took this portrait of her mother when she was youngDiavolo: was me!Diavolo: I can't let Moody Jazz's ability replay that!Diavolo: I'll have to go there myself.Diavolo: I have to do it myself.Diavolo: I can't let any of my subordinates attempt to handle this.Lady: Oh, y-you were home.Lady: I knocked, but...

The traitor assassin!Doppio: He appeared just like the fortuneteller said!Diavolo: Apparently, due to the plane crash,JoJo-main: ,he came to notice the existence of this photo of Sardinia that was at Trish's house.Diavolo: We need to take care of him first.JoJo-main: ,Otherwise, he'll interfere once Trish arrives.Diavolo: I'll be the one to finish him off.Diavolo: We need to get close to him without him figuring out my true identity.Diavolo: Risotto's ability is a mystery to me, as well.Diavolo: Draw him out about two meters away from you.Diavolo: Then he'll definitely be within Emperor Crimson's range.Diavolo: You can do it.JoJo-main: ,I'm hanging up, my Doppio.Doppio: Yes, I understand, Boss.JoJo-main: ,Beep.Doppio: What's this? My head... It hurts.Doppio: O-Oh, yeah.

I have to get closer!Doppio: But to what?Risotto: I won't get closer to you.Risotto: Look over here.Doppio: Wh-What the?!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,But I think I've seen him before...Doppio: Wh-Who is he again?Risotto: Move your hand.Risotto: Otherwise, I can't see your face.Doppio: I-I don't have any money!Doppio: B-Blood!JoJo-main: ,Why does this always happen to me?!Risotto: Maybe I just imagined it.JoJo-main: ,The ignorance and fear in his expression are not an act.Risotto: If he was from Passione, he wouldn't act like this.Risotto: Not to mention, he's more unguarded than a baby.Risotto: He must be a civilian.Doppio: Please don't!Risotto: Stop fussing. I'm just going to pick up my Kn*fe.Risotto: I don't care about you anymore.Doppio: I-I don't feel so good... My head hurts...Doppio: T-Two meters...Risotto: That's right.JoJo-main: ,There was just one thing you did that seemed like an act.Risotto: When you fell,JoJo-main: ,you reflexively hid the envelope so I wouldn't see it, didn't you?Risotto: It's right under your left shoe.Risotto: What are you hiding?JoJo-main: ,If I'm satisfied with what I see, I'll leave.Doppio: What is your deal?!JoJo-main: ,I-I don't have any money! Just let me go!Risotto: It wasn't murderous intent or hostility, but your expression there seemed fake.Risotto: Stand up, move your left leg, and show me.Risotto: I told you to stand up! Stand up!Risotto: Oh, so it's just an envelope.Risotto: There's nothing in it.Risotto: Your trembling certainly isn't an act,JoJo-main: ,and I can tell you're a coward who can't lie.Risotto: But now... I'm even more interested in you.Risotto: You're definitely a Stand user.Risotto: You heard that sound, too, didn't you?Risotto: Just now, you glanced over toward that sound.Risotto: That's the sound of scouting.Risotto: It's carefully scouting the area.Risotto: That sound and shape...Risotto: is Li'l Bomber!Risotto: They've finally made it here!Risotto: And who are you to show up to such an important location?Risotto: It must mean that the boss trusts you greatly.Risotto: But there is true fear in your heart.Risotto: You're a walking contradiction!Doppio: Shut your trap!JoJo-main: ,You're the one who's about to be shaking in your boots!Risotto: I see.JoJo-main: ,Since you're running toward me, you must be a close-ranged power type.Risotto: Your range is around two to three meters.Risotto: As long as I know that, I know how I'll k*ll you.Doppio: What... the... M-My throat!Doppio: Th-These are...JoJo-main: ,actual razor blades?!Doppio: T-Two meters, damn it!Doppio: I'll shove these razor blades right up your ass!Risotto: I told you, I know how I'll k*ll you.doppio: Impossible! I'm not done yet, damn it!doppio: H-He disappeared?Doppio: That's his... That's his assassin ability...Doppio: But how...Doppio: Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...Doppio: Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...Doppio: There's a phone ringing somewhere!Doppio: Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...Doppio: I can't believe it!JoJo-main: ,There just happens to be a pay phone in a place like this!Doppio: Click!Doppio: Beep!Doppio: Hello?!Boss: My Doppio...Doppio: Wh-Where are you, Boss?Doppio: Are you nearby?Doppio: If you are, please come quickly!Boss: I cannot.Boss: I cannot go there until you get close enough to him.Boss: Because everything will be overJoJo-main: ,if he happens to see me and then manages to escape.Doppio: B-But—Boss: You need to get closer. You need to get within two meters of Risotto!Doppio: Boss! I don't know what his ability is!Doppio: He could att*ck me again at any second!Boss: Doppio...JoJo-main: ,Oh, Doppio...Boss: My adorable little Doppio...Boss: Did you forget that I gave you a portion of my Emperor Crimson's power?Boss: Now is the time to use it!

Their physique can change, as well as their way of speaking.Riso: I had just thought that you were the boss's most trusted subordinate.Riso: But you...JoJo-main: ,To think that you...Riso: I can't wait.JoJo-main: ,I can't what to see what your face will look like once you die!Riso: There's nothing else you can do.Riso: I'm keeping my distance.JoJo-main: ,You have no strength to resist.Riso: There's nothing you can do!Riso: I've won!JoJo-main: ,I'm going to chop off your head!Riso: This is the end!

The enemy was already here.Nara: But I sh*t right through him! I hit him good, too!Riso: Y-You...Boss: If the blood in my body that's been robbed of ironJoJo-main: ,isn't going to carry oxygen throughout my body...Boss: It's the same thing as if my body wasn't breathing.Boss: Which means that the only thing Li'l Bomber can track right now...Bruno: How many enemies are there, Narancia?Nara: Just one!Nara: There's only one person breathing on that cliff!Boss: ...is your breathing, Risotto.Boss: I see.Boss: This is the same thing that happened in the footage that Doppio saw, but...Riso: I was winning...JoJo-main: ,I would've won...Riso: But you had thrown the scalpels at them...Riso: Boss...

Here comes three!Cio: Oh, my bad.Cio: Good!Cio: Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good...Cio: You're such a good boy, Secco!Cio: Now, go!Cio: You go to Bucciarati and the others, Secco.Cio: You and your Stand, Sanctuary.JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio  Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part Mista: What are we going to do, Bucciarati?Mista: We can't go back out to sea.Bruno: If that mold's range is extended by the corpses, as Giorno guessed,Bruno: then instead of tracking down the user,Bruno: we're better off finding a car and getting out of this village.Bruno: Our number one priority right now is to get to Rome.Bruno: Giorno, how's Narancia's treatment going?Gio: It's hard to treat him in this village.Gio: There's living mold in his wounds.Bruno: All right, Mista, climbing up is fine.Bruno: We're going to go up those stairs and get ourselves a car.Trish: That's a bit cruel, Bucciarati.Trish: He didn't even ask Narancia if he was okay or not.Trish: Not to mention, earlier,JoJo-main: ,when you were trying desperately to get up from the boat,Trish: what did he say?Trish: He coldly ordered you to throw the turtle.Nara: What are you so mad about?Nara: Of course he said that. I was the one who went down into the boat.Nara: It's good that we made it out alive, but because of me, we almost d*ed.Nara: Besides, if Bucciarati hadn't told me to throw the turtle,JoJo-main: ,I might've dropped it into the ocean.Trish: I know that!Trish: What I'm saying is that he's cold to everyone!Nara: Say... I don't really understand how girls feel, but...Nara: Were you hoping he would ask you if you were okay?Nara: I already know how Bucciarati is,Nara: but you're dying to know more about him.Trish: Excuse me? I'm dying to what?Nara: Well, getting to Rome is what's most important right now.Nara: You can figure out your feelings later.Nara: I'm really not doing so great right now.Nara: Let me rest for a bit.Mista: The only way we can go is up right now,JoJo-main: ,but if we should ever have to go down any lower than where we are...Bruno: We'll be fine.JoJo-main: ,This village is built on the side of a mountain.Bruno: All the roads are uphill.Bruno: And outside the village, there are cars still running.Bruno: That means the mold's range hasn't expanded yet.Bruno: We just need to acquire a car and get out of this village quickly.Bruno: We need to hurry to Rome at all costs.Mista: Which car should we take?Bruno: One with a corpse next to it, because that corpse should have the key to that car.Bruno: It was just the mold breaking that corpse's hand apart.Bruno: I'll watch our rear.JoJo-main: ,You hurry up and get a car.Mista: Right.Bruno: Mista, I take that back.JoJo-main: ,Something... Something is wrong.Bruno: Hurry and go up!Mista: R-Right!Bruno: What are you doing, Mista?! I told you to go up!Mista: I already am, Bucciarati!Mista: But...Mista: We're sinking!JoJo-main: ,We're moving away from the wall!Bruno: What's going on?Mista: The whole staircase is being pulled into the ground!Mista: This must be a different Stand user than the one using the mold!bruno: There's another one after us!Mista: This isn't good! We need to hurry and climb up!Mista: If we go down any further, the mold will att*ck us!Mista: Jump onto the wall!Mista: My g*n!Bruno: It's not sinking...Bruno: The staircase itself is sinking into the ground, like it's melting!Mista: What's that?Bruno: The enemy!Bruno: The enemy's down below, and he's coming for us!Bruno: Mista! Climb onto the wall!bruno: Zipper Man!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HC&\c&HDA&}Zu{\c&HB&}bo{\c&HBA&}ombruno: He's fast...

I can't tell where he is!Bruno: Where is he coming from?Mista: Can you hear me, Six b*ll*ts?!Mista: Come back to me!b*ll*ts: Yee-haw!Bruno: One coming at us from beneath the ground,JoJo-main: ,and a man-eating mold Stand...Bruno: They're both making the most of the other's Stand ability.Bruno: This duo is too compatible, more so than any other team we've encountered before.Mista: What are they, bound by the red thread of fate? Damn it!Mista: I found one, Bucciarati.JoJo-main: ,A corpse that's still holding the car key.Mista: You bastard!Mista: I just caught a glimpse of our enemy!Mista: He jumped from the stairs and dove into the wall!Bruno: Th-This is...Bruno: Run, Mista!Mista: It's fast! At this rate, we might make it to the car,JoJo-main: ,but we won't have time to start the engine!Mista: I'll hold them back! Keep going!Bruno: Don't stop, Mista! The ground is still hard!Bruno: The b*ll*ts are going to ricochet!Mista: If the sinking ground is still hard somehow,Mista: our best chance is the moment I get pulled under.Mista: This guy's the powerful, close-range type.Mista: His range is small.Mista: I should be able to see it as soon as it tries to pull me in.Mista: That's when I'll get him!Mista: There! It showed itself!Mista: Now!Mista: Take this!Bruno: Mista!Mista: I see...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I figured a powerful, close-range type might be able to deflect some b*ll*ts.Mista: But you see...Mista: If you're going to deflect b*ll*ts, my b*ll*ts can do that, too!Mista: The first three sh*ts I fired should...Mista: What?!Mista: He's not going to finish me off?Mista: So he thinks he can k*ll me at any time, now that I'm hurt?Mista: Hurry and pick up the key, Bucciarati!Mista: Start the engine!Mista: What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up and get in the car!Bruno: If we can actually get out of this village by car, that's fine.Bruno: As long as we can all head for Rome.Mista: Where are you going, Bucciarati?!Mista: Wh-What?!Bruno: So you're going to track us from underground, no matter where we go?Bruno: What a terrifying ability.Bruno: But do you have any idea where I'm headed?Bruno: Apparently you didn't, huh?

Aren't you tracking them down right now?JoJo-main: ,Why are you calling me?Secco: Hey, Cioccolata... This is important. Very important!Secco: Chase... Is that thing...Secco: Is it alive? Or is it a dead Stand?Cio: What brought this on?Secco: It's a simple question!Secco: Answer me. If Chase was here,JoJo-main: ,would your Green Tea's mold grow on it? On the dead Stand?Cio: Notorious Chase...JoJo-main: ,Are you talking about the one where the user was k*lled, but his hatredJoJo-main: ,was so strong that the Stand somehow survived?Cio: Who knows?JoJo-main: ,I'm curious about him, but I have no idea if the mold would grow on him.Cio: But I do know for certain that my Green Tea will destroy any living creature.Secco: The mold doesn't grow on inanimate objects like rocks, right?Cio: Forget about that! Quit wasting time and film those guys dying already!Secco: That's just it, though, Cioccolata!Secco: Look up the hill. Look at the road.Cio: Hey, Secco...Cio: Why is there a car leaving the village?Cio: Is the one driving the car one of them?Cio: Why did you just let them go?Secco: Hey, Cioccolata... It's just unbelievable...Secco: He hit me in the face.Secco: That Bucciarati guy... He didn't have any mold growing on him.Secco: Even though he jumped down!Secco: I can't believe he att*cked me there...Secco: It's totally unbelievable!Secco: His body won't grow mold! What the hell is going on?!Cio: I haven't the slightest.Mista: I totally thought...Mista: that you had plummeted.Mista: You scared me, Bucciarati.Mista: Did you hang on to the wall with zippers?Mista: I guess it might've been a close call.JoJo-main: ,It doesn't look like the mold got you at all.Gio: Mista, rest for a bit.JoJo-main: ,I closed your wounds, but if you move now, they'll start bleeding again.Gio: I'll look out for any cars that might be following us.Mista: Right...Gio: Bucciarati, your wrist... Did you hurt it?Gio: Please, let me see it.Gio: Are you listening, Bucciarati?Gio: If the mold got to you, you're in danger.Gio: Please, let me see it.Gio: That's...Gio: Th-That's impossible...Gio: Your skin is so cold...JoJo-main: ,A-And your pulse...Bruno: Giorno, did you just say something to me?Bruno: I couldn't hear you.Gio: What's... going on?Gio: Impossible...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,It simply can't be!Gio: O-Oh, yeah... Something similar happened before.Gio: I thought it was just my imagination back then...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,When we were leaving Venice.Bruno: Apparently, I hurt myself.Bruno: Looks like there isn't much time left.Bruno: I'm losing more and more feeling in my skin...Bruno: Or...JoJo-main: ,Maybe I never had any to begin with.Gio: That's impossible! Don't tell me, back then...Gio: When you saved Trish from the boss in Venice...Gio: Bucciarati, don't tell me... back then...Bruno: It's strange.Bruno: I've accepted this as fate.Bruno: Just a tiny bit of fate, of chance, that Heaven had granted me.Bruno: When you healed my wounds in Venice,JoJo-main: ,it appears the life force you gave meJoJo-main: ,allowed me to move for just a bit longer.Gio: Why... Why didn't you say anything?Gio: My Golden Wind completely healed your wounds back then!Gio: I'm sure it can fix whatever you're going through now, too!Bruno: Giorno, I'm sure your Golden WindJoJo-main: ,knows more about that than anyone else.Bruno: That nothing can be done for those whose lives have already ended.Bruno: By that time,JoJo-main: ,my life...Bruno: had already ended.Bruno: You won't tell the others about this, right?Gio: That's impossible... But that's impossible, Bucciarati!Gio: Y-You're—Bruno: Quiet, Giorno!JoJo-main: ,Listen. What's that sound? Am I just hearing things?Gio: There's no car following us.bruno: I hear it.

It's a helicopter!Bruno: He dropped some mold on us!Mista: Wh-What the hell just happened?!Giio: Bucciarati, we're descending! This road goes downhill!Gio: The mold is going to get us!Bruno: Giorno, Mista! We're jumping out!Bruno: Grab on to me!Bruno: Climb up! Climb up, even if only a little bit!Gio: Subconscious...Gio: In a way, Stand abilities are the users' subconscious abilities...Gio: If there's any guilt in their heart,JoJo-main: ,they might subconsciously hit the brakes...Gio: But whoever this is enjoys cruelty.JoJo-main: ,Actually, he lives for it.Gio: That's how his ability became this.Gio: This guy doesn't have any brakes at all!Gio: He has no limits on how evil he can be!Guy: Hey, what's wrong?! I-I'll go get a doctor right away!Mista: Hey, don't! Don't go down that way!Guy: I'll bring a doctor here right away!Guy: Hey, what's going on?Gio: The mold...JoJo-main: ,It's spreading instantaneously!Bruno: That's impossible. There are three million people living in Rome.Bruno: This is nothing like that fishing village!Bruno: And there are members of the organization in Rome.Bruno: This would be a hit to the boss, too.Gio: This guy doesn't care.Gio: He's enjoying this!Gio: At this rate, everyone in Rome will die!Gio: No, this guy's not going to stop, even if it spreads further than that!Bruno: There's something else!Bruno: At this rate, the mold's k*lling range will spread to the ColosseumBruno: faster than we can get there.Bruno: Mista! Is that helicopter within your g*n's range?Bruno: It doesn't matter! We have to hit it, no matter what!Bruno: Make sure you take it down!Mista: Got it! I won't let you get away!Mista: Go, Six b*ll*ts!b*ll*ts: Yee-haw!Mista: The guy in the helicopter wanted me to sh**t at it...Mista: So that the guy who can move around underground could safely get to us!Cio: All right, Secco was able to splash down safely... or should I say land?Cio: Now they're cornered.Cio: And whoever Bucciarati and his men were meeting in RomeCio: will be dealt with by Green Tea.Mista: Th-That bastard's coming from the top of the hill!Mista: And we can't go back down!Bruno: Mista, concentrate on the helicopter!JoJo-main: ,We can't let it escape!Bruno: I'll deal with this guy.Mista: I-It's no use, Bucciarati! It's already too far away!Mista: I won't be able to hit the fuel t*nk or the propellers from here!Gio: No, Mista.JoJo-main: ,You never know until you try!Mista: It's no use! They won't reach!Mista: I know the b*ll*ts' range better than anyone.Mista: The helicopter got away!JoJo-main: ,The guy underground is coming for us!Gio: The b*ll*ts hit their target, Mista.Gio: Now, the two of us are going to go take care of the man in the helicopter.Gio: Let's go after the helicopter!Mista: Go after it? The helicopter?Cio: What?! What is this?Gio: We have to take care of him before the mold's k*lling spree reaches the Colosseum!Gio: Bucciarati,Gio: we can leave the guy beneath the ground to you, right?Bruno: Go, Giorno!Bruno: Run, Mista!

Send me over there!Five: I'll go bring everyone back!Gio: No, it's no use, Number Five.Gio: He's captured the b*ll*ts that he's destroyed,Gio: because he knows Mista won't be able to heal unless he gets his Stand back.Gio: I can't heal him.Five: N-No...Gio: And he's probably waiting for you to come.Gio: If he manages to destroy you, the final b*llet, Mista will die.Gio: He's someone we should've faced head-on!Gio: Mista!

It's a trap!JoJo-main: ,Useless!Gio: What?!Gio: Wh-What the hell is that thing?Five: Giorno, be caref—Five: Giorno!Cio: Curiosity...Cio: is the most important factor for mental growth.Cio: I've never been so gratefulCio: as I am right now for all the experimentation that was conducted on me as a child.Cio: I made very close observations on what parts of the human bodyJoJo-main: ,I could sever and still keep that body alive...Cio: Of course, I'm quite aware of which veinsCio: need to be closed off to prevent bleeding out, too.Cio: And if I cover the parts that I sever with Green Tea's mold,Cio: I can continue moving around,Cio: despite being in pieces, and hide wherever I need to.Five: You can't fall, Giorno!Five: If you fall any further, the mold's going to att*ck you!Five: G-Giorno!Sign: SeccoSign: SanctuaryFive: Hurry and climb up!Cio: There are times when you truly feel blessed, aren't there, Giorno Giovanna?Cio: I believe there are two situations in which you feel blessed.Cio: The first is when despair changes to hope... You feel blessed.Cio: When your plant grabbed on to this helicopter,JoJo-main: ,I actually panicked because I thought I was in danger.Cio: I was in utter despair.Cio: But I got through it.Cio: I was able to turn that despair around with my experience and mental strength.Cio: And that makes me feel truly blessed right now.Gio: Golden Wi—Cio: Don't you dare climb up here!Five: Giorno!Cio: Did you forget that both of my legs were still hiding?!Cio: And the second situation that makes one feel blessed...Cio: is when you look down upon someone who's in utter despair!Cio: I've won!Cio: By the time you hit the ground,Cio: the mold will tear your body to shreds!Five: Giorno, take this!Five: Jump in there, Giorno!Five: Hurry and return to the helicopter!Gio: Grazie, Number Five!Five: Pound him!Cio: How pitiful.Cio: Nothing's changed, Giorno Giovanna.Cio: I, Cioccolata, am still going to win!Cio: The branch you just grew is also living.Cio: Meaning if it drops even a few centimeters,Cio: mold will att*ck that branch!Five: Jump onto the helicopter, Giorno!Five: Hurry!Five: Giorno!Cio: I did it! Now, show me that expression!Cio: Show me despair!Cio: Show me, as clear as can be,JoJo-main: ,the moment you lose all hope and die!Cio: Show me your despair as you fall to your death!gio: Bene.JoJo-main: ,The angle I calculated toward the helicopter's propellers was perfect.Gio: Because it was alive, the branch was destroyed by the mold.Gio: However,Gio: the part of the branch that fell from its root no longer holds life.Gio: It's just a piece of wood.Gio: Because you destroyed it, the branch returned to being a b*llet.Gio: By the way, all that bullshit about being blessed that you were yapping about...Gio: I can't say I feel blessed at all, even though I'm looking at you.Gio: Because I've been winning against you from the start.Five: You did it! I can't believe it, Giorno!Five: That was close!JoJo-main: ,You defeated him before the mold got to the Colosseum!Five: Please take care of Mista's wounds, too, Giorno!Five: That was close! Now the rest of the b*ll*ts will be back, too.Gio: Could you move just a little to the right, Number Five?Five: Huh?Gio: I might just be worrying too much, but... What was his name? Cioccolata?Gio: He might actually be...Gio: You're just pretending to be dead, aren't you?!Gio: And you're thinking.Five: Giorno?Gio: If you can move your body just a few centimeters before I climb up there,Gio: you can slip beneath the trench and escape.Gio: You'll be able to activate the mold again,Gio: and you'll win. That's what you're thinking.Gio: To be honest, I have a hole in my right lung right now.Gio: My subclavian vein has been severed, and four of my ribs,JoJo-main: ,my right humerus, and my right hand bones have been shattered.Gio: I'm honestly not sure how fast I can get up there.Gio: But my Stand is Golden Wind.Gio: It's a power type with a range of two meters.Gio: If I just take a moment, I'll be able to end you.Five: H-He's dead! You sh*t him through the head!Gio: Good point.Gio: If you continue to stay still, I'll incapacitate you,Gio: but I promise you I won't do anything else.Gio: I'm giving you a choice.Gio: So, what are you going to do?JoJo-main: ,I'm going to start climbing now.Cio: Stay away from me! Look behind you, you moron!Cio: I've taken Mista and the turtle hostage!Cio: You dumbass! While you were busy talking,Cio: you apparently didn't notice that I snuck my right armJoJo-main: ,up from under the tree's shadow!Cio: I'm going to chop off Mista's neck now!Cio: If you come after me, you won't be able to treat Mista!Five: Mista!Cio: I'm the winner, after all!Cio: Take this!Gio: It's true.JoJo-main: ,I kept talking because I wanted to buy some time.Gio: The time I needed to make the b*llet that went throughJoJo-main: ,your head earlier evolve and return to your wound.Gio: The piece that remained in your head lured the b*llet and returned to being a stag beetle.Gio: When I aimed for the propellers,Gio: I imbued it with Golden Wind's life force...Gio: so that I could finish you for good,JoJo-main: ,whether you were dead or alive.Cio: B-But you said... th-that if I stayed still.... y-you wouldn't do anything...Gio: Oh, please.JoJo-main: ,Did you really think you'd be that lucky?Gio: A piece of sh*t like you?Cio: Y...

I win.Cio: You concentrate on Bucciarati.Cio: I'll scratch your back when you get back.Cio: I'm sure you want some sugar cubes, too, don't you?Cio: I'll throw you some.Cio: You deserve a treat.Cio: How many would you like?Secco: Um...

Who's "Polnareff"?Turtle: Let me just say this first...Turtle: I only did this because Diavolo left me with no other choice.Turtle: This strange phenomenon that's happening to all of you right now...Turtle: is a part of the arrow's power,the arrow I was supposed to give you.Turtle: I'm desperately hanging on to my soul... so I can tell you this.Nara: The arrow?JoJo-main: ,So you're saying this was caused by that arrow?Turtle: To be more precise, it's because my Stand, Silver Chariot, took hold of the arrow.Turtle: My body is already dead upstairs.Turtle: The reason I was able to swap souls with this turtle and survive isJoJo-main: ,because of that arrow.Gio: There's definitely someone in the hallway on the second floor.Gio: There's a dead guy who's been knocked out of his wheelchair!Turtle: It's only my body? Where's Diavolo?Trish: Hey! If everything you're saying is true,JoJo-main: ,your Chariot can return us to normal, too, right?Turtle: No... I currently don't have the power to control Chariot or make it disappear.Turtle: I don't even know where it is right now.Turtle: Chariot has basically gone berserk.Mista: Your own Stand went berserk?JoJo-main: ,How irresponsible can you—Nara: No. More importantly, what happened with the boss?Nara: What happened to him?Nara: Where is Diavolo right now?Turtle: I don't know.JoJo-main: ,Diavolo was right in front of me, but he disappeared.Turtle: All of you, listen very carefully.Turtle: The arrow is not your enemy, nor is it your friend!Turtle: What I'm about to explain to you is hope!Turtle: Such a trivial... trivial coincidence happened two years ago.Turtle: After I was incapacitated by Diavolo,JoJo-main: ,I somehow managed to survive and hid in a small farming village.Turtle: That's where the trivial thing occurred.Turtle: The arrow we had retrieved in Egypt fell between the wall and some furniture.Turtle: It's truly an insignificant thing.Turtle: Normally, one would just stick their arm back there and pick it up.Turtle: But for my body, it was an arduous task.Turtle: I thought about just leaving it there,Turtle: but I figured that Chariot could get it for me.Turtle: That's when it happened.Turtle: Chariot hurt its finger on the arrow.Turtle: It was mere coincidence.Turtle: The arrow draws out Stands from those who have potential.Turtle: But if it happens to pierce a Stand...Turtle: I don't know how old that arrow is,Turtle: but I'm starting to understand what the person who created it was thinking.Turtle: There's more to the power of a Stand!Turtle: Something that goes far deeper!Turtle: Suddenly, the birds in the sky fell,Turtle: bugs hid beneath leaves, and cattle laid on the ground.Turtle: And the farmers started sleeping in the streets.Turtle: I felt a slight change, but a much bigger change had taken over Chariot.Turtle: I had a bad feeling, so I immediately took the arrow away from it...Turtle: before it could go berserk.Turtle: Everything went back to normal, as if nothing had happened.Turtle: Then I realized that if someone who had enough power were to use this arrow,Turtle: they would have the power to control the minds of all living creatures!Turtle: But I currently don't have that kind of power.JoJo-main: ,And that's why I waited...Turtle: for someone like you who was searching for Diavolo's true identity.Turtle: Though, in the end, Diavolo was able to outdo me.Trish: So this controlling minds thing...JoJo-main: ,Do you mean the thing going on right now?Trish: It's just swapping souls?Turtle: No.Turtle: Remember when I said that this was just a part of its power?Turtle: I can't control it, so I wasn't able to see its potential beyond that.Turtle: But it definitely exists!Turtrle: Go retrieve the arrow!JoJo-main: ,Stop Chariot before the boss can, and reclaim the arrow!Turtle: The only way to defeat Emperor CrimsonTurtle: is for you to use the arrow to its full potential!Turtle: So in order to take back the arrow, you're telling us to k*ll Chariot.Turtle: Am I assuming too much?Turtle: That's fine.JoJo-main: ,Once you take the arrow, Chariot will be destroyed regardless.Turtle: Besides, I've already been finished off.Turtle: There's one other unbelievable and important thing that I need to tell you.Turtle: Are you the girl called Trish?Mista: Yes, though I currently have hairy knuckles.Turtle: I see...Turtle: The boss is a duo.Turtle: There was a kid who was somehow able to transform into you and trick Bucciarati.Turtle: Diavolo and this kid were like a well-coordinated team.Mista: What? B-But how?Nara: But that's impossible.JoJo-main: ,The boss trusts no one. That's how he kept his identity secret for so long.Turtle: I'm not sure what happened, either...JoJo-main: ,But there was definitely a mysterious kid.Turtle: If it wasn't for that kid, there's no way I'd have let Diavolo get that close to me.Nara: Two... So the boss is a duo?Nara: What's...Gio: Giorno! Something's moving!Gio: Nine o'clock. Uno signal.Gio: It's a person!JoJo-main: ,There's a person heading in from the gate on the right!Mista: H-He's...Mista: That face!Mista: The boss! No... Diavolo!Nara: Narancia...JoJo-main: ,Get Li'l Bomber behind him—Turtle: Giorno, wait!Turtle: The left! Look to the left, in the shadows!Turtle: So there it is!Turtle: That's my Stand, which the arrow evolved...Turtle: Chariot Requiem!Nara: He's—Nara: Th-This isn't good!Nara: Diavolo was looking for Chariot!Nara: He's trying to get the arrow!Turtle: Giorno, wait!Turtle: Don't att*ck just yet!Mista: That Stand!Nara: It's Zipper Man!Gio: Th-That's Bucciarati!Gio: It's Bucciarati's...JoJo-main: ,soul!

I can see his Stand's movements!Dia: I can perfectly see what it's trying to do!Dia: I can estimate what these pieces of trash are going to do!Dia: That should fully stop Golden Wind's movements!Dia: Even after time starts moving again in a few seconds,Dia: your eyes will never be able to see myself or Emperor Crimson again!Dia: The pinnacle of truth lies within my abilities!Dia: Yes! I've won!Dia: I'm just a moment quicker!Dia: I've completely ripped out his heart in my premonition!Dia: The future has chosen the actions of my Emperor Crimson!Dia: This is the end!Dia: Wha—Dia: What?Dia: Don't tell me this is...Dia: Is the time that I disposed of reversing... because of Requiem?!Dia: N-No! Everything is returning to normal!Dia: But my premonition still favors me!Dia: Take this, Giorno Giovanna!Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: Wha—Dia: What is this?Dia: What am I seeing?Dia: A-Am I dreaming?Dia: Am I witnessing some kind of illusion?Dia: No... that can't be true.Dia: The only one who can move within the time I've disposed of is me!GW: This is...

They only eat algae.JoJo-main: ,They're vegetarian.Mista: Usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat, but sweetfish guts are delicious.Mista: It's because they're not carnivores.Mista: So with that logic in mind,Mista: all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals!Mista: Cows, pigs, and chickens!Mista: The better their feed, the better they taste!Mista: Which leads us to this conclusion...JoJo-main: ,Humans would taste gross because they eat meat!Mista: Well?

05x01 - Stone OceanQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:11: P.M. It's raining. OCTOBER ,  It was… always raining. What the… Hey, what are you making the fuss for over there? You're getting on my nerves! I'm done for. I can't live any longer. He saw me last night. A male prison guard. I can't live anymore! Just k*ll me! Dammit! Man, what the hell? What's up with you? What's your name again? Jo… What was it? Jolyne, was it? What do you mean he saw you? Well, you know, like… The "M" word… What? In other words, I… Speak up! I'm trying to say… Well, like… Masturbation… -What? -What? What? -Hold on. -I won't be able to get married anymore! So wait, you were seen? A prison guard saw you touching yourself? Which guard was it? I woke up before sunrise. Something about the moonlight going in through the shape of the window bars kind of, well, turned me on. So, I… Yes. When I came to my senses and looked up from the bed, the youngest guard here was staring at me with a face like he couldn't believe what he just saw. He stood right in front of this cell! Just k*ll me! I've seen him around. He's the one that's kind of handsome, isn't he? Oh, my god. So how much did he see? I'll get to the point. How low were your panties? Man, you're really after me. Like hell I'd tell you. But I learned my lesson. I'll never masturbate again ever as long as I'm alive! I swear it! I don't know about that. What? Man, how can you get turned on with those bars? Shut it, snotface. Stop butting in, you airhead! As if you've never done it before. I'm not dirty-minded like you lowlifes. And who the hell are you? You want to bet on who can last longer? Idiot, how is this a bet? Masturbation is done in secret. How can we prove that we haven't done it? What if I told you that the joint on your left ring finger tells all? You're in here for sexual as*ault, aren't you? Your ring finger's discolored. Inmate , , and . You're getting transferred. Standby at the bars. Reach your arms out of the cell. What you said about the ring finger, was it true? Or like fortune-telling? You're Japanese, aren't you? You're an interesting one. So what did you do? Why did you get thrown in? I'm innocent. EPISODE : STONE OCEAN You were charged. For stealing and hit-and-run. VISITATION ROOM You were arrested for robbery twice in the past. You won't be granted parole. In other words, Jojo, you will be transferred to Green Dolphin's holding cell where you'll be tried at the court. Don't call me Jojo. Only my mom calls me that. And what's this criminal history? Sure, I borrowed a bike without asking. I was  at the time! Like I said, I'm innocent! You better defend me at any cost. I'm coughing up money. Yes, I will do my best for you and the law. Dammit. Also, when do I get to see my mom? You know she's tender-hearted. She's a little worn out. Most of all, she's worried sick about you. She brought you a few things. You won't have to wear a uniform while awaiting your sentence. Here's your change, a book, and a magazine. Not to mention your homework. What is this? It seems to be a charm of some sort. There's a tiny stone inside. Your father had given it to your mother to pass it on to you when you're in trouble. What did you say? That hurts! It hurts! Are you okay, Jolyne? What's that screaming for? Be quiet! It's nothing! It was just a pinch. Is this a stone? Where did you hear about my dad? Your mother is attempting to contact him. His daughter faces a great predicament, after all. As you know, your father is a marine biologist. He is conducting research in Africa and he hasn't been able to fly out here yet. She's trying to fly him here? No way in hell he'll come. He's… That bastard… I don't need this cursed charm of his! What the… What's the matter? It's nothing. When is your next visit? In two days, at the visitation room of Green Dolphin Prison's holding cell. Hey, Jolyne, I thought you were innocent. Though it's a probationary cell, it's still under Green Dolphin Prison. If you're transferred there-- The trial will clear my name. I won't go to prison. We are crossing the bridge now. We'll arrive in ten minutes. That didn't take long. Ten minutes until we're there. -What? Who said that-- -I heard it from the driver's seat. You can't hear them from here. We're crossing the bridge now. ETA is ten minutes. Understood. How did you know? Is this another fortune-telling of yours? Yes, it's strange, isn't it? I'm not sure either. You sure are a funny one. I'm Ermes Costello. I robbed a gas station. It's my second time, so I'll be sentenced without a doubt. Nice to meet you, Ermes. NOVEMBER , : P.M. Green Dolphin Street State Prison and the adjunct probationary cell, aka "The Aquarium." The premises cover  square kilometers. Imprisoned here are  males,  females, and  minors under  years of age. Hey Jolyne. You got cash on you? Maybe. Hey, I'm warning you. If you don't bring in a few Benjamins, you might end up dead. If you don't have any on you now, make sure to have someone bring them to you at a visitation. And you're assuming I'll be thrown in because? I'm just giving you a heads up. As if you've got cash yourself. The guards would've taken them right out of your hand. How naive, Jolyne. There are many ways to stash them. You mean, you stuck them up your ass or the other hole? Gross! I thought that was a movie thing! Dumbass, that's the first place they inspect. Then where? Ah, you got them in your boobs, don't you? You slid some cash in on top of some silicone implants? No way! I was kidding! You found me out. Don't tell a soul, though. See the stitches? It bleeds a little when I take them out, but I got five s in one and a  under the other. We're at Green Dolphin Street Prison's probationary cell. Inmate  and , get off. Inmate , Ermes Costello, this isn't your stop. Welcome back, Ermes Costello. What brought you back? Robbery? An injury incident? What? Did you say something to me just now? Inmate , look straight ahead! Spill it, Ermes. I know you've got some. You got cash, right? Cash? I got none, I'm afraid. I hear them! Something's not right! These guards can't hear them at all! It's just like when we were crossing the bridge. I can hear faraway voices! Ouch! This is… Spit them out, Ermes. This is your second time in the Aquarium. I know you're carrying some! What is this? Do not talk, Inmate ! Can't they see these threads springing out of my hand? Okay, I'll take them out now. You know, Ermes. This isn't enough to prove our friendship. I bet you got more on your body somewhere. Oops, the bus is braking! Please let me off the hook with the . I've got no one who can give me more. Please, I'll die in there without the money! You got big tits for someone with a big build. Those tits are suspicious. Let's search them. Hold her still. Sure. No… Stop! Let go! Who do you think I am, bitch? What… What just sprung out? What is this… Could it be… Did that stone cause this? What did my dad send me? NOVEMBER ,  A.M. Hey, remember how I tossed that charm… PROBATIONARY JAIL …at the visitation room? I wonder where it ended up. Well, I do not recall. Anyhow, let's discuss our case. If you wish to claim your innocence, I need to know this detail. During that hit-and-run, were you the one in the driver's seat? OCTOBER , : P.M. WEST PALM BEACH, WEST FLORIDA So about your nickname. Romeo, can I call you "Rocchu" from now on? Sure thing. Only when you're gargling mouthwash. What, you don't like it? Why not? Rocchu, I'm hungies! How about that? Doesn't that fly? No way. My friends can't hear that. I love the way it's all lovey-dovey. My mom has called me "Jojo" ever since I was a baby. I want you to call me Jojo too, Rocchu. Hell no. Anyway, I'm thirsty. Let me take a sip. You can't. It's a cocktail with a strong alcohol content, %! I'll be safe. No, you can't. I said no. Romeo! Romeo… Just now, we… Romeo! This isn't happening… No! This is bad! We need to get help. Romeo, call an ambulance! Jolyne, please. Please don't do that. Don't call. Listen to yourself! We need to get help! He d*ed instantly! You're going to run? No! This was an accident! And we can't run! This car is the evidence! Let's say the car was stolen! But… Jolyne! Jolyne, if I'm arrested, our future together is over! Not to mention, I'll go to jail. We'll be separated! So please! Don't you love me? Of course, I do. But this is… A car is coming. We're finished if we're seen! Jolyne! I need a hand! He's dead, like I thought! Please. Help me, Jolyne! I love you! Jolyne! Jolyne, the police believe that you stole the car and caused the accident while under the influence. And what is Romeo's claim? He claims his car was stolen. Goddammit… I want to die! Was Romeo the one driving? I can't tell you that. All right, then. This is what we'll do. Jolyne, do you know what a "plea deal" is? If you admit all of your crimes, they'll reduce your DUI charge. Then you'll only get sentenced for stealing and involuntary manslaughter. You'll be paroled after a year or so. I told you to fight for innocence! I understand, but we need to compromise. If they find you guilty during the trial, you'll get at least five years. We don't have time, Jolyne. We must agree to the deal before the trial starts! Defendant Cujoh. You voluntarily admit to the details of the plea, is that correct? Yes, I admit. This court will consider that the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh, admits to the crime and consider her release since the m*rder was not premeditated. However, this court cannot condone the act of disposing of the victim, who was still alive, in a swamp, effectively murdering him. The victim was alive? What is that about? What is he saying? A m*rder? This court finds and determines that the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh, shall be confined to Green Dolphin Street State Prison for  years. This court is adjourned. What? Hold on… Fifteen years? How could you? I struck a deal! I agreed! Didn't I, Mr. Lawyer? I've done my best. Take care, Jolyne Cujoh. Hold it. Where are you going? What are you saying? Fifteen years? What's this about? That's not what we agreed on! Hold still! I said hold it! You bastard! You don't need to worry anymore. The sentence has been finalized. She agreed to the plea deal. She won't be able to appeal. There won't be any further investigations. Congratulations, Romeo. Thank you. You saved my life. Please thank your rich father. Romeo, you… Romeo! Fifteen years… My entire youth,  years! From now on, in addition to the name your parents gave you when they birthed you little shits, the state will give you an inmate number, so be grateful! This prison is Category Level , Maximum Security! FE. When you hear this number, whether you're taking a sh*t or eating, it's referring to you! b*at that into your head! FE, we will now conduct a body search. Throw everything you're wearing into this tray and… Strip! Begin! Remember, education is the first thing you need to do to trash. Make sure to humiliate them. What's taking your time? "Strip" means your panties too! Now, show me your ass… Are all fours okay? Or do you want me to lie on my back? I can perform a stunt or two if you'd like. You bastard… You think you can stroll out of here? It sure is hot in here. My shirt is covered in sweat. It might rain. Would you like to take a break in the director's office? The AC is on. Oh, don't inconvenience yourself. All the documents have been submitted. This heat is nothing compared to my client's fate. For her to receive a -year sentence at her age… If only I were able to help. No, you are a spectacular lawyer. Oh, speaking of your client, Jolyne Cujoh, she asked me to give this letter to you. The content's been cleared. I see. Pass this on to him too. Feeling comfy? But you will keep sweating. Now and forever. What the hell? I can't reach him right now and I'm powerless. I can't wait  years. I'll come to see you. And Romeo, farewell, my first love. Between that dingy place and my car, the air sure is different. To think that I have to breathe the same air as those scum with this job. I can't breathe… This thread… is choking my neck! The AC might be drying it out! I must… remove it! This is another way to use it. It activates with my thoughts and I can manipulate it with the force of my mind. He wanted me to protect myself using that charm. This will be fun.
05x02 - Stone Free / Prisoner FE40536: Jolyne CujohQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:12Welcome, inmates. I am the warden of Green Dolphin Street State Prison, Locobaroco. And this lovely crocodile here is Charlotte, my assistant. Great to meet you! Charlotte, please explain how life is in this institution. Okay! Similar to the United States, this prison is based on the concept of freedom and equality. You may freely walk around the facility and exercise as you please. You may use the phones, the shower, and the library as well. If you are an exemplary inmate, you may even own a TV. You could also work or study and earn university credits. That's right. Yes! What is it, Charlotte? But Warden, there are rules too, right? You're absolutely correct, Charlotte! First, do not remove the wristband with your inmate number. No lending or borrowing of items between inmates. No possession of metal objects. How about earrings? The warden's still speaking! Shut up! Earrings are prohibited, FE, Jolyne Cujoh. Feel free to ask any questions to the prison guards. You are now dismissed. All right! Everyone, face left! It's so spacious. The entire island is the prison. Oh, a crocodile. FE. Cell  will be your home from now on. Today's free time is over. The cells open at : a.m. Breakfast begins at seven, but you may choose to sleep in. Try to get along now. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I'm Jolyne. I'm Gwess. Want some? Thanks. But I don't have an appetite. There's so much to get used to-- Ouch! What the hell-- The bottom bunk is mine! You got a problem with that, you bitch? I didn't mean to instigate a fight. I just misunderstood since your things were on the top bunk. That charm! Bitch! Get your dirty hands off of my stuff! Can I see that charm? There should be a small stone and a photograph of my parents inside! It could have belonged to me! I bought it for two dollars from a newcomer the other day. Because it's just so beautiful. Let me see it! You better watch your mouth, ugly! Okay, I'll buy it off of you. How much do you want? Two hundred dollars. What? You heard me, dumbass. I said  dollars. You bitch… Lights out! What's going on? Too much is happening all at once. I have so much to think about. I'm so sad that I'm starting to cry. What the hell? I'm sorry. About last night, I mean. What? It's morning. Here. You can look at it. But… There was nothing inside it. No pictures, no nothing. See? Was there anything else in it? Like a stone? No. Nothing. Anyway, please forgive my behavior last night. I'm shy around new people. Oh, there's nothing to forgive. It was my fault. I don't know the rules around here yet. Jolyne, you are a good person. Let's be friends from now on. Yes, I'd like that. Anyway, it's breakfast time. I'll see you there. Hold on, I'll go with you. What the hell? There's water all over the place! My pants are soaking wet. This sucks! What do you mean it's "sold out"? I haven't eaten yet. As you can see, you're free to sleep in. You're also free to get here late. Isn't there food for everyone? Any leftover milk or bananas? That's the strange thing about prisons. That makes no sense! Oh, Jolyne, you took your sweet time. I'm so full. Hey, Gwess. You had two milk cartons and two bananas! Two bananas? No way. Are you still asleep? Also, sorry about the water. I accidentally spilled it. I'll clean it up later. I already cleaned it off. Oh, thank you. You're so kind, Jolyne. This is… Jump for me. I believe in you. I love you, and you love me. Don't we trust one another? Do it for me. Good boy! Aren't you an adorable little birdie? Good job! Here's your reward! Good morning! No, Pi-chan. Not "good morning." Say "I love you." You're such a darling when you say that you love me. I love you! Good boy! You're such a good boy, Pi-chan! Next, perch. Jump over. Taking risks is part of trust-building, Pi-chan. What? Come on, jump! Whoa… What did you just say? "Whoa"? Say that again! Do birds go "whoa"? I love you! I love you! I love you! You're covering it up now, aren't you? You think such a blatant lie works on me? Do you? I've had it with you. We're through. What was that? A banana? What is this? Though it's tiny, it's definitely real. That woman… had already k*lled it! What is she doing? I knew it, she must have used that charm to gain some sort of ability! Where did she get that tiny human? What… happened to me? STAND NAME: G.G. DOLLS STAND MASTER: GWESS This is… My body shrank! I knew it was you. How did you snatch away my Pi-chan? Jolyne! Jolyne. I'm starting to like you, really. What happened to my body? Explain! Listen, Jolyne. Please don't talk. The person inside that parrot-- Hey, I said no talking! Get in it. I removed its guts. There was a flaw to using a parrot. Birds can't use their arms and they can't grab. Rats, though, have front paws. He was a prison guard who got fired for slacking off. The warden thinks he left the facility. Also, I told you to keep quiet. But if you can mimic a rat squeak, I'll let it pass. You can say, "I'm going, squeak!" or "I'm hungry, squeak!" Got it? Just as I thought, you look darling! Now it's time for training. Go, faster. Run! No slowing down. Lift, Chorokichi. Chorokichi? Everything has a name. The Word was with God, and all things were created by the Word. That's why I named this power that shrank your size. "G.G. Dolls." This is the name of my mental power. Let's stack another book. You… You think you can cheat me like that? How dare you betray my trust. We're through! Just kidding! You passed, Chorokichi. Your shrewdness will prove useful. Very very good! Can you see? Down this corridor is the control room. The switch within that room can deactivate the locks in this facility. You can pass through. You see what I'm getting at. You are I are breaking out. For some reason, I can't shrink myself. But if we cooperate, we can leave. We need to trust each other. Of course, we'll need to concoct a more reliable plan. First, I want you to check out everything beyond this corridor. Do you really think we can escape? I told you to squeak like a rat! Squeak, how do I get to the control room, squeak? How cute! How precious. But how should I know, dumbass? That's why you're on this mission. Look up. That's the surveillance camera. But it can't see below this bar. Walk under the handrail. Put your hood on. Now go! Hey, you. What are you doing? That's right, you with the headband. State your name and number! FE. My name is Gwess. I'm just loitering around. If you have no business here, then leave! Leave immediately. Sure thing, Mr. Prison Guard. There are four steel doors. Which one is the control room? Also, there are two cameras here. What's going on? I'm running out of space. What's happening? Did you hear that? Yes, I heard it too. It was close by. My body… It's getting larger! The coffee's ready. Maybe it was from the coffee maker. -It didn't sound like it. -This is bad. What's going on? Distance? Is it because Gwess is far from me? Is this ability affected by distance? I heard it again! Something's lurking nearby! sh*t! It's right under there! Hey, move out of the way! I said move it! That's hot! What the hell, man? What the… I told you it was from the coffee maker! My bad. This investigation is over! I need to get back before I get too big! What is that? G.G. Dolls! This monster… This monster… It resembles a doll, but it's transparent. It's just like my thread. Others can't see it. It's the materialization of Gwess's ability. "G.G. Dolls." This is the name of my mental power. It shrank me and tore the prison guard to shreds! This shithead was inside the rat with me! And Gwess. She didn't know that the ability would get deactivated. My body is returning to its original size. This monster thinks I'm ditching, so he's here for a hunt! Not only that, he wants to completely k*ll me! -G.G. Dolls! -sh*t! Why is this happening to me? Am I going to get k*lled by a monster like him? I'm stuck! Threads. A bundle of threads. This must be the shape of my energy. Its form! The yarn weaves into its form. Hey, monster! Scream, you shithead! Get Gwess. Hurry! Jolyne… Turns out you have an ability. Gwess! Stop! Don't hurt my precious G.G. Dolls! Shut up! Make my body smaller so I can escape! Just by a bit, though, got it? All right, you can sleep on the bottom bunk bed! Please don't hate me despite what happened between us! But please squeak every once in a while. Just hurry it up! Finally. Now, the charm. Give me the stone and tell me who sold it to you. Of course. Two hundred dollars, was it-- Shut up, bitch! Tell me who sold it to you! All right. Some woman named Ermes sold it to me. Ermes? I don't know much about her. Here. Well… I got her! Guards! We have a problem! This bitch here crossed the g*n point! Come here, quick! What are you doing there? How did you get over there? Jailbreak! Code ! It's all over for you now. The prison guard is retrieving the shotgun as we speak. He has every right to sh**t you down! No questions asked! Jolyne! Serves you right! It's what you get for trampling on my heart! Good grief, Gwess. You said everything has a name. I'll name this ability of mine too. "Stone Ocean." I'll become free from this ocean of stones. Did you hear me? Stone Ocean. That's the name. If there's a hierarchy system in this prison, I'll follow it. However, I'm the one who gives orders. Now let me cross over. -What? -Where is she? -She disappeared. -What? Are you sure she was there? Well, I just saw her back, so… Strange… Dad…
05x03 - The Visitor (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:13This court finds the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh… You're an interesting one. So what did you do? Why did you get thrown in? I'm innocent. …shall be confined to Green Dolphin Street State Prison for  years. What is this? Turns out you have an ability. "Stone Ocean." I'll become free from this ocean of stones. EPISODE : THE VISITOR () Stone Ocean. When unraveled, this thread can reach far. However, it becomes less powerful and inflicts less damage. When it bundles, it hardens. Its reach is reduced to about two meters. Can I break through the bars with Stone Ocean? No, it lacked the strength to do so. The most it could do was this. My mental energy is harnessed using the stone inside the charm. I'd like to get out of here using this power, but now's not the time yet. First, I need to learn all I can about this place. Hey, you. I'm talking to you! Sorry, but can you lend me some change? I've got some in my room, but the call is about to disconnect. I can pay you back as soon as I'm done. A dollar is all I need. I haven't spoken to my family in a while. Sure. Here. Thanks! You saved my skin! I'll pay you back for sure! Move, bitch! Don't try to cut in line! Hold on! I was waiting for her to finish for  minutes! I didn't see you waiting in line! Dumbass, you must be new. You've got to reserve these phones in advance. No one told me that! Well, now you know. Also, the reservations are made a month in advance. A month? Why should I wait a whole month for a few minutes of phone time? That's what's strange about prison, isn't it? Hey, I'll buy that spot on the phone from you. And this is the cause of the phenomenon. Hey, Mom! I want to call her. I need to hear her voice. The voice of my mom… Jolyne! How do you fare? Shut your trap! Keep away from me! I already told you I'm through with you! Don't push me away like that. I'm giving you a warning. You messed up big time just now. What? You just lent a dollar to that blondie, right? Get her to pay you back right now. No, your life here will be over if you don't get it back now. What are you saying? Of course, she'll pay me back. It was just a dollar. Hey, you said "just a dollar"! You're digging your own grave with that mentality! What? Listen closely, Jolyne. At the Aquarium, lending or borrowing money between inmates is one thing you should avoid at all costs. Even if it's just a dollar. Let's say that you fail to get the dollar back. You know what will happen? You'll become a bottom feeder like her. "Jolyne the newbie couldn't even extort back her dollar." The rumor will spread like wildfire and you'll be the target in no time. Just like her. One after another, every single day. Once you're out of money, you'll be forced to give your body and even your mind. Isn't that what hell on earth is like? Hey, now. You're exaggerating. Am I, now? It was "just a dollar" for her at first. See that blonde from earlier? She went to her room, but she's not planning on coming down for you. I'm telling you for your own sake. Got a minute? Oh, hello there. Apparently, this one's a classic. Have you read it? No. I'm here for the money. Are you ready to pay me back? Oh, of course. A dollar, right? I haven't forgotten. It's all in my head, don't worry about it. I'll pay you back later. You said you have the money in your room. You went back, right? Do you have it now? Shut up, you bitch! I said I'll give it back later. I don't have it now, you hear me? You a tightwad or what? Anyway, can you lend me ten more? I can call up friends on the outside and ask for more money! Please? You've got to have some on you. Come on, don't be shy! What's this… What the heck is this? I can't hold it in! Hey, you in there! Can you hurry it up? I know you're in there! I'll give you the dollar! -Please! -You'll pay me later, right? Don't worry about it. Take your time. I'll buy the time from you! I'll pay five… No, ten dollars! Sold! Sorry. That'll be ten dollars. Hey, you. Go use the bathroom next. Someone else will have the urge to use it soon. It's up to you whether you can get your money back, though. You're the only one who can save yourself. What the… What's going on? That's right, I'll be leaving soon. Somehow, I'll get out. Inmate number FE. I'm returning to my cell. Please unlock this door. Tomorrow at noon, you will have a visitor. But you must not meet him. You must not go to the visitation room. If you do, you and others will be in grave danger. A fate more terrible than death will happen. Who was that just now? How did a child sneak in here? Hey you! Didn't you hear my order to standby? Do not touch the bars! Stand back! Open the door. Right now! I said do not grab the bars! A visitor is coming tomorrow at noon. Not to see you, though, but someone in the next building, you know what I mean? That's the intel. Oh, by the way, you got it on backwards. Your pants, I mean. You're overreacting. Sorry about yesterday, FE. But it's your fault for grabbing onto the bars like that. Rules are rules. I had already let go. But you still hit me twice. What? Did you mutter something? Couldn't hear you. Never mind. How can I help you? Someone's here to see you. Stand up. I'll handcuff you. A visitor? Who is it, my mom? How the hell should I know? Give me your hands. Stand on the mark right there. I'll explain the rules. You have  minutes. You are allowed to hold hands, but kissing or undressing are not allowed. You will receive anything they bring after the visitation. Foreign languages are forbidden. Depending on the visit, the guard may choose to end it. Wait there until you're authorized. You mustn't go any further. Turn around. Go back to your room! It's not too late! Who are you? How did a child like you get in here? I don't quite understand either, but there are some things more fearsome than death. And it's happening at this very prison. So please turn back. Go back to your cell! No. My mom must be here to see me. I want to see her. She must be missing me too. I need to let her know that I'm doing well! Then take this. It should protect you. FE, all right. Enter! These are bones! Stop dawdling. Get in. Jolyne, did you receive the charm I asked your mom to give you? Dad… STAND NAME: STAR PLATINUM STAND MASTER: JOTARO KUJO Car and wallet theft. as*ault. This must be some mistake! My Jolyne would never… Since she's only , she won't be charged this time. You're headed to Tokyo? This is your daughter we're talking about! Why not go tomorrow instead? And you call yourself her father? Hello? Are you there? Jolyne, are you listening? Where's the pendant? I'd rather receive disciplinary action. Had I known it was you, I wouldn't have come here. Hey, open the door! sh*t, I hit him too hard. Get up! Good grief. Jolyne, listen up. It was not your boyfriend Romeo who conspired to frame you for m*rder and had you sent to this prison. Johngalli A. This man is incarcerated in the men's prison here. He's ex-m*llitary. A veteran sn*per who could hit his mark under any difficult circumstance. According to the report, his vision has deteriorated due to cataracts. This man was behind it all. Even that manslaughter accident. A henchman of Johngalli A. kidnapped an innocent hitchhiker and threw him in front of the car. He also hired a greedy lawyer to set up the trust-fund baby. Johngalli A. was pulling the strings from this prison. Help me, Jolyne! Do you know what a "plea deal" is? I love you! This court finds the defendant, -Jolyne Cujoh… -Fifteen years… Damn you! You hit me twice yesterday! Dammit! What's the point? Why would he plot my imprisonment? -Sit. -Answer me! I said sit. Listen. Johngalli A.'s target was you all along. It's so that he can eliminate you any time he wishes within these prison walls. Why is he after me? Because you are my daughter. You are of the Joestar bloodline. Joestar? The Joestar bloodline can be traced back hundreds of decades. And Johngalli A. plots to take revenge on our family. We are endowed with the wonderful gift to move others. But at times, powerful emotions leave dregs. Dregs called grudges, that is. In the past, I defeated a mortal enemy of the Joestar clan. Johngalli A. is a pawn of this enemy. We've never met, but I have no doubt about it. Though it's been over  years, Johngalli A. uses his fanaticism for this man to exact his revenge. I don't understand. I thought you were just a marine biologist. What's this about enemies and grudges? Just know that you are being targeted. I'll get you out immediately. We will bypass the law. Have you acquired your Stand yet? "Stand"? As my daughter, you are predisposed to the ability to use this power. Did you see any changes from the pendant I gave you? It seems you have. That's the Stand ability. Stand… Then you too? Use your power to get out. Okay? Quit your yapping. Don't try to act like a father now. So you're finally here to save me. What, because you love me? I've already forgotten about you. But fine, whatever. I'll keep that shocking story and the Stand ability in mind. You can go now. Don't ever visit me again. My handcuffs! When did I get out of them? Since when… The brand is different. The guard didn't even approach the table. Jolyne, get away from that door! Star Platinum: The World! Time, stop! What happened just now? Stay still! The fight has already begun. What's the layout to the right? Any windows in that direction? Two or three. But they're all barred. This is a real b*llet. This b*llet, called a sn*per Premium, is specific to r*fles. The sh*t was undoubtedly taken by Johngalli A. Hold on, I thought he was an inmate. Inmates are prohibited from even having pens. Is that so? But g*ns can be disassembled, you see. Precise parts may be snuck in through various objects. Guards can be bribed by his henchmen and the objects won't get searched. Little by little, slowly but surely. But we're in the women's prison! He can't possibly sh**t me from the men's! We're inside a building. There are obstructions! A r*fle and an ability make that possible. In other words, Johngalli A. is, without a doubt, a Stand user. Look. What's that? Keep your distance. Certainly, that's not just some rubbish. But it's moving away. It seems really light. It's just floating in the air. Don't engage it. First, we must know what it can do. It dodged! I said don't engage it. Can it see my thread? Don't be so loud. It's reacting to something. However, not to the thread. Its movement seems unrelated to the thread. Oh, could it be reacting to that? What was it called? The change in the air from the thread. Like, the movement of the air? Aerodynamics. It detected our positions using aerodynamics. All right, so he knows our location. But how can he sh**t us from the men's dormitory? That's the real problem. Jolyne, you were saved by a fortuitous accident. Do not make a move until we understand the contraption. Don't order me around! -I know that! -You… FE! You're done for, I'll have you know! Got it? Jolyne Cujoh! -What? -It's headed towards us! I'll make sure you get disciplined! Don't move! After I b*at you to death, that is! Calm down! Jolyne, don't leave the wall! I know! And don't order me! Let's knock him out before we get into more trouble! Damn you, who do you think you're talking to? You bastard! Jolyne!
05x04 - The Visitor (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:13Tomorrow at noon, you will have a visitor. But you must not meet him. You must not go to the visitation room. Someone's here to see you. Turn around. Go back to your room! Dad… Johngalli A. This man was behind it all. Johngalli A. is, without a doubt, a Stand user. Just know that you are being targeted. I'll get you out immediately. My handcuffs! When did I get free? Jolyne, get away from that door! Star Platinum: The World! Time, stop! What happened just now? Stay still! The fight has already begun. Aerodynamics. It detected our positions using aerodynamics. Do not make a move until we understand the contraption. Don't order me around. -I know that! -You… FE! Who do you think you're talking to? You bastard! Jolyne! -You… -Don't move! Keep your voice down. It'll detect our position again. Johngalli A. uses that Stand to read the airflow. It may even react to the change in our breathing. Plus, that Stand can be used remotely. He can sh**t at that Stand to reflect the b*llet to his target. It's a sniping Stand. We cannot att*ck Johngalli A., who is in the men's prison. We have to destroy that long-range Stand. Any damage dealt to the Stand is reflected on its user. I'm well aware. The problem is, the moment we move to prompt an att*ck, the Stand will detect our position and Johngalli A. will sh**t at us. Stay by the wall, Jolyne! It's detecting your location! Jolyne, what are you thinking? EPISODE : THE VISITOR () Your own muscles cannot be trusted. When skin comes in contact with a breeze, the muscles have a twitching reflex. This is an a*t*matic reflex you cannot control. Therefore, I use my bones to affix the r*fle. Bones land firmly on the surface. The g*n is as stable as the surface itself. Its stability is something we can trust. Meteorologists may argue that the direction of drafts cannot be predicted. That may be true, but only to an extent. Is this fly flying randomly? No. It flies while smelling things nearby and feeling the air current. The wind is the fly's movement. Just as the guard said, Jotaro Kujo is here. He's here to see his daughter, Jolyne Cujoh. The descendant of the Joestars is in the visitation room at this very moment. Within range of my ability, Downtown Transfer. Joestar… Joestar! My life will finally begin after I eradicate your family's blood! You will pay for robbing me of the one who was my rock! I see. You said we have to destroy it, right? Look at its movement. It can't detect the wind due to the precipitation. Now's my chance! Stone Ocean! No, wait! Look closer! It's evading every drop of water. It's reading the drops' air current to avoid them. Jolyne, go back to the wall! He's going to sh**t at us! This isn't good. Once the guards arrive, the air will stir! -Hey, listen! -What? Hurry, move the base of the pillar! Kick it with all your might! -But you're… -Don't worry about me. Got that? Please don't forget what I said. I want you to survive! I don't know why, but there's a descending hole between the walls. It seems to be a passage. Maybe it leads to the sewer or the vent. What is this? It may lead us to the outside. Let's go, Jolyne. Seems it's our only option. -It flew away… -No. It's still close. It's looking for the perfect angle to snipe us. No… It's following the boy on the other side of this door. He plans to hunt the boy because he helped us escape. Jolyne, go down the hole! I came to break you out! Before I entered this room… he grabbed this arm of mine. I'm sure of it. I can't believe it, but he's here. He was just an ordinary kid like you'd see at any park. And we don't know each other… We're complete strangers. But… he grabbed my arm with desperation in his eyes. The warmth of his hand even felt as if he cared about me. I'm going back inside. Before he sh**t the boy, I'll k*ll Johngalli A.! Good grief. To the visitation room! That's where the fire alarm went off! There are no cameras there. -Be prepared to engage! -Where did he go? That boy… How does he move through this place, appearing and disappearing out of nowhere? Hurry! To Visitation Room B! Did that boy dig this hole? This wall… So he used this! His height is about cm. His build is small, almost like a child's. I don't know who he is, but the hole that suddenly opened is a vent. I know where it leads by reading the air. However… I can't have this small guy guide Jotaro and his daughter deep underground where I cannot reach them! I will not lose those two again! I'll finish this small one first! Jolyne, our situation is too dire. Our Stands are only good for defense at the moment. Should we strike, Johngalli A. will read the movement of the air. This is too dangerous. Hey, you! You can't just leave the room! This side is the prison! -Good grief. -Leave from the other side! What the… There it is! Just as I thought, it's chasing the boy! But there aren't any windows here. How can he aim through the men's prison? No… However… This boy… Look at him! How smart! No, we're blessed! With his body submerged completely underwater, the air is unaffected! And, he's inside a pipe! Johngalli A. cannot find him now! Not only that, there are no windows down here. Surely he can't sh**t him now… The pipe is bursting! But how? Where is he aiming from? Could he be… Distance to the target is m. The b*llet drops .cm while airborne, and there's a slight ocean breeze of . meters per second. The b*llet will drift by .cm to the left. Finding its target. Targeting his heart. sh*t! Stone Ocean! Threads! Jolyne Cujoh… This is her Stand ability! She followed the boy down? Is she an imbecile! She thinks her net can stop my b*llet? Changing my target to Jolyne Cujoh. Targeting the forehead. Now, sh**t! How? I'm so glad I broke this pipe beforehand. The moment I came in, I punctured this gas line. Gas is lighter than air. It creates a layer of gas separate from oxygen. I thought it would obscure your aim. Man, was I right. How did she do this? You're too late! You're mine now! Stone Ocean! Seems you couldn't read your own fate. STAND NAME: DOWNTOWN TRANSFER STAND MASTER: JOHNGALLI A. Who are you? How is a child like you roaming freely about this prison? I hit myself. This bone. That's right. You gave me this. What is it? It looks like a bone. What's going on? You tried to stop me from going to the visitation room. Just what do you know? Hey, answer me! Not yet… I can't, yet. You mustn't let that go. This smell. Is this your doing? That sn*per guy, Johngalli A., his Stand? It was nothing once I got to it. I pounded it into a thousand pieces. I see. It seems you're quite used to fighting with your Stand. Not out of choice… There he is! Right there! He's on the move! Hide! He has a r*fle. He's hiding behind that pipe. I saw him going above the t*nk! That's impossible. He was targeting from the men's prison, which is  to m away. There are layers of bars between us. Not only that, he is almost completely blind. How do you suppose he traveled so fast? How the hell should I know? If I said he's here, he's here! Hide! He's directly above you! All right, I believe you. And get ready. The gas must have been accumulating. We did it! Hey, we're safe now! What the… Where did he run off to? Are you hiding? You don't have to be afraid anymore. Come out and explain what's going on! What are you doing? I'm looking for the boy. Did you see where he went? I don't understand what you mean. What boy are you talking about? Oh, I see. You didn't see him, did you? I was talking to a little boy outside the visitation room. Johngalli A. tried to get rid of him first. Get rid of him? What are you talking about? You came here on your own. And so I followed you. Hold on, our stories aren't matching up. You must have heard his voice. No, I know you did! He's the one who told us about the secret passage! You were there with me! Did you hear a ghost or something? I don't know of a secret passage. Damn you! You're messing with me at a time like this? You're here now because you followed me down the secret tunnel… Hold on… Something's not right with you. Your wound… You were sh*t. What happened to your wound? Wound? The b*llet wound from when Johngalli A. sh*t you! On your right shoulder. But you aren't bleeding, and your clothes… I don't have a scratch from being sh*t either! This man… He isn't Johngalli A.! He's the prison guard! But I saw him get sh*t through the head! His head is unscathed! What do you mean he was sh*t? And who is Johngalli A.? What's going on? Something's amiss. It's not adding up! What is this? A fate more terrible than death will await us all. You must not go to the visitation room. The visitation room… That's right. Something was off from the very beginning. When was I uncuffed? And that b*llet… Was I really sh*t back there? But my dad and I don't have a scratch. Was Johngalli A. attacking us to begin with? Something's wrong. Nothing is making sense! This isn't reality! I'm in a dream of some sort. No, I'm under someone's spell! This is… A dream… Was I… dreaming? Since when… It looks like I did knock out this prison guard. This photo of Johngalli A… Dad showed it to me. The accident with the hitchhiker. I heard that it was all a plot to imprison me. That was all real. And then I tried to leave the room. That's when I noticed I was uncuffed. That was the moment. No, I was sitting down when I awoke. So before then… We haven't stepped outside of this visitation room. In other words… Johngalli A.'s Stand was an illusion my mind created. The secret passageway too. The moment we stepped into this visitation room, we fell under their trap and were forced to dream. As if engulfed by a python, slowly but surely, we're being melted to the bone! The boy in the garbage can who gave me this bone. He was real! I was able to wake up because I cut myself on this bone! Without the pain from the cut, I would have stayed asleep. This ability is Johngalli A.'s att*ck! My thread! I can't unravel it, not even for a few centimeters! This is bad! Dammit. I'm getting sleepy again… We need to get out of here. Out of this visitation room! Stone Ocean!
05x05 - Prisoner of LoveQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:15EPISODE : PRISONER OF LOVE What's this? Looks like you're awake. Were we dreaming just now? Yes. And this substance is dissolving us. In this very room. Please break down the door… Use your ability, Star Platinum. Hurry! You did it! Now drag me out! Let's get out of here! Hold on. What did you just say? Did you say "Star Platinum"? That's my Stand name. How do you know that, Jolyne? From the looks of it, we started dreaming after I told you about Johngalli A. Which means you haven't seen my Stand ability yet. Since we are related, you may be feeling its presence, but you couldn't have known its name. It's not adding up! This is not reality! Stone Ocean… Jolyne. You finally woke up. That took too much effort. My thread melts fast. Jolyne… You were dreaming too. I don't know about yours, but mine was a terrible nightmare. I see. So we were both dreaming as if watching a movie. Guess so. It would've been perfect if only we had some popcorn. I can't move anymore. Not even a finger. What about you? Can you move? What we are perceiving could still be a dream. If you can't move at all, then we're awake. We are in this reality where we can't escape this room. I see. We'll die at this rate. The charm's ability… Show me the ability you used to wake me up. Stone Ocean. Yes. Can you materialize it? I mean your power. I understand, but it's no use. It was hard enough to wake you up. No way could I break down the door. No, just materialize it. That's it. Keep going. Can you bring it out a bit more? Move it slightly towards me. It'd be best if you could move it a bit more to the left. This will do. It's not ideal, but it's close enough. Now we can leave this room. That was my Stand, "Star Platinum." Pull me out. This isn't a dream. I'm certain of it now. Damn you… Bullshit… It hurts and I'm pissed. I can't believe you hit me. We got out, but I'm pissed! We're definitely not dreaming, all right! Okay, give me your hands. What now? Let's go. Oh, right. Do you know what this is? This bone saved our lives. It's a human bone. Plus, it's the sacrum from the pelvic area of an adult female. Its surface looks like it was dissolved with some kind of acid. Dissolved? Is that what was used on us? Can't say. I don't know why you have that bone, but it doesn't matter now. I was the only one who saw that boy, but he's definitely here! It's a mystery, but he's within these prison walls! Code , emergency level . Emergency alarm activated in the visitation room. Emergency level , code . What's your plan now? I guess now you're a criminal too. Like I told you, I'm breaking you out. You have the charm, don't you? It's crucial that you hold onto it. Don't lose it, no matter what. Let's go. We're leaving this place. Who would have thought that they would be able to escape this room. Is it just me? I don't see that many guards. This is a common area. Look at this. We'll escape through the window marked with an X. This window faces the beach. We'll board a submarine at the beach to escape this island. A submarine? I have an amicable relationship with a group called The Speedwagon Foundation. They have provided our way out. There doesn't seem to be a camera in this hallway. Our target window is one left turn away. Then we'll be about m away from the shore. I'm sure there is a lot to consider, but let's get out of here first. Let's go. It's just the fan. Jolyne. It hurts! Where are you looking? Stay calm. Stand up. What's the matter? Give me your hand. It's just that… Well, thanks, but I can stand up by myself. That's not what I meant. You almost lost this. Be careful when you trip. I told you not to lose this charm. What is it? I told you it's important. You must hold onto it. Take it. You're headed to Tokyo? This is your daughter we're talking about! And you call yourself her father? Hello? Are you there? You haven't changed a bit. You're calm and collected as ever. When I almost d*ed from a fever, you didn't come home to check on me. When I drove a car for fun and was accused of theft, you took a plane to Tokyo instead. Right. As long as I'm safe, you don't care, do you? Even now, I'm just a troublemaker that doesn't get hurt even if I fall! See? Lucky me, no harm done! Yahoo! What are you talking about? If it's that important, hold it yourself! Listen. Shut up. I don't want it! That's not it. Something is off. We're being quietly followed. Jolyne, duck. There's no one over here. They might have headed the other way. Oh, it's just a guard. Hey, look closely! The door is bent! The convicts have come this far! We are at-- That's… Johngalli A.! That bastard… He's here to finish us off himself! Jolyne! Head towards the window. I'll take care of him. That's Johngalli A.'s Stand! But the only time he ambushed us was in a dream. -Die! -Are we still dreaming? No! This is reality! Time stop! Our enemies… There are… two of them! Not only did he force us to dream, but he showed us Johngalli A.'s actual Stand within it! They had been preparing for this moment. The moment I have no choice but to use my Stand ability to protect my daughter! Their target was me all along! Time will move again. Jolyne! You were one move behind. Jotaro Kujo, I have been waiting for this moment! It was just ready for me. Perfect. I finally got what I've been after from Jotaro, the invincible Stand User! This is Pale Snake's ability! Those b*ll*ts! The Stand! How? I thought we only saw his Stand in our dream! Anyway, while he can't sh**t, I'll… I see the shore! We're close! Go on without me. I'll catch up. Were you actually… sh*t? Listen to me. A Stand User only controls one Stand. This means we are up against two enemies, Johngalli A. and the one who tried to dissolve us. Go on ahead. Take this charm. Don't drop it. A transmitter is implanted within it. It's there to track your location. The submarine is honed to follow the GPS signal. You understand what I'm saying, right? All you have to do is go to the beach. The submarine will come to you. And The Speedwagon Foundation I told you about will find you. If you understand, then go, Jolyne. This charm… But earlier, you… No. You couldn't have… I've always cared about you. What is it? Your chest… You're not… No, why? Go, Jolyne. It's just a little blood. I'll catch up soon. Liar! Earlier, you sacrificed yourself, and the enemy took something from you! That's why you couldn't evade the b*ll*ts, right? What did he take? Don't tell me… your Stand? Jolyne! What? These are… These threads! Since when? Take this! Shut up. We're about to leave from this window and head for the beach. Don't get in our way. Got that? You… When did she acquire such a Stand ability? An ability of this strength should have been reported before her sentencing! Very well. I will drop my g*n. I wasn't asking you to drop your g*n. I was just looking for the best angle. Your body's best angle to punch, that is. I only like it when your chin is tilted slightly to the right. Just now, I should have finished her first instead of Jotaro! Jotaro wasn't the one I should've gone for first. Does Pale Snake know about this? Jolyne Cujoh. Without a doubt, she is Jotaro Kujo's… She's a Joestar! Jolyne. Back then, in that dream… you said you'll stay behind at this jail for some child you barely just met. He grabbed my arm with desperation in his eyes. I'm going back inside. It was a mere dream I saw. But… Dad! Dammit, we're so close to the beach! Dad! Find them!We have permission to sh**t! A guard has been sh*t. The convict is armed. We can sh**t to k*ll! Where is it? I'm at the beach already. Where are they? That organization you're friends with, called The Speedwagon Foundation… I don't know who they are, but if they really did send us a submarine, then they must have incredibly advanced technology and financial power! A g*nsh*t wound like this… This foundation must be able to administer the care you need better than anyone else! Where is the submarine? Where is it? Everything you said was true. The submarine is already at the beach! We're saved… What the hell are you doing? You can't… No, this can't be happening. No, this isn't happening. He was sh*t, but it wasn't deep. It's not a fatal wound. It can't be a fatal wound. Then, Then his heart… Why isn't it b*ating? Now, I know. The Joestar blood runs in you. Jolyne, with your strong conviction, I know you'll be fine. Found them! Something's moving on the other side of the fence! Watch for the g*n! No, I'm not outside the fence. I'm right here if you're looking for me. You! Hold, don't sh**t! Her hands are up. -But… -Don't sh**t! She's unarmed. Are you surrendering? There must be another man. A tall man who visited her. He must be nearby. Find him! That's where you were. Why? Why didn't you run? I'm sorry, but your father is already dead. His spirit was stolen by that sludge. You barely managed to survive! Why didn't you leave? Why? The m*rder*r escaped inside the prison. Not outside, inside! The m*rder*r had planned to steal my father's Stand by giving it form. That's his ability! Then the m*rder*r retreated back into the prison. He won't leave this place. He is within these walls! Are you actually trying to get his ability back? Do you think it'll bring him back to life? That's precisely why I'm going back inside. I'm sorry to say this, but a corpse will only rot away. That melted bone I gave you belonged to my mother. That sludge stole her ability and she d*ed. I see. My mom was an inmate here and gave birth to me. I grew up in hiding within these walls. What's your name? I'm Emporio. Emporio. Your mother's bone saved my life. Thank you. But, I can't explain it, but I'm certain of it. My dad's not dead. If I get his Stand back, he will come back to life. That's why I'm going back! You've done it. You finally acquired this powerful Stand which can stop time! Yes, and I have you to thank, Johngalli A. We make a great team together. Please take me to the men's prison. I let my guard down. And have you seen my g*n? It's right here. You're the only one who knows who I am. You shall be my scapegoat for the m*rder of the guards. This way, everything works out peacefully. To be able to communicate something to someone... Jotaro had said that is a wonderful thing. I agree. And here, we have a way.
05x06 - Ermes's StickersQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:16Green Dolphin Street Prison. Also known as "The Aquarium." At some point in time, it had birthed mystery and power. Something unseen by ordinary men. Power and mystery drenched in filth. PUNISHMENT WARD Jolyne got five added years for her jailbreak and has been in the Punishment Ward for a few weeks. Everything will start afterward... Everything. INFIRMARY WARD Before that, I must investigate something. It concerns another inmate. Her name is… Ermes Costello. Jolyne has already met her. Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? Hey! I'm talking to you, bastard! Is this... the infirmary? EPISODE : ERMES'S STICKERS sh*t! That was the bathroom janitor. That was my hard-earned money. Dammit! Oh, I'm starting to remember now. I hurt my right palm. I had a fever too. But my hand is almost completely healed. Was I dreaming? Hold on. It's coming back to me now. Right before I got sent here to serve five years for the robbery I committed, I picked up that charm. It was in the washroom of the holding cell. But that charm cut my hand, so I got pissed and sold it to… What was her name again? Oh, I think she's called Gwess. Anyway, I sold it off to her. And that night… something caused me to pass out. I've been held here since. Have I been bedridden since? My hand is better too. Hold on, what just… Just now, I peeled off this sticker from my palm. Is my memory okay? In , Columbus discovers the Americas. Bugs Bunny's birthday is July th. No, my memory's fine. What the… I'm sure I peeled it off just now. Wait, what? My shoes… There are… One, two… three, four, five, six… Huh? What? Ouch! Ah, five of them? They're back to normal. Did the high fever cause astigmatism?! But that sticker just now... That's the sticker I tossed aside. No way… Gross! -What are you hollering about? -Keep it down, will you? It's nothing. Go back to sleep. sh*t. No. I didn't get astigmatism from my fever. I'm definitely touching the shoe, and I feel its weight. This sticker… When I attach it to an object, the object is duplicated. Once you peel it, there's a bit of destruction, but it merges back into one. And this sticker… I know it sounds crazy, but there's no doubt about it. It emerged from inside my body! And now that I've accepted it, it's quite useful. This is awesome. No point in overthinking it. This sticker emerges from my palm. This is reality. assh*le. Give me my money back. What is this… He left… He didn't seem to notice it. I grabbed it without thinking. This disc… What does it do? Your fever has gone down. You may now return to your cell. Well, I have a question. The bathroom janitor. Is he a model prisoner? What's his-- And what will you do with that information? Next! The janitor inmate? How the hell should I know? No idea. It's not a CD, but it's shaped like one and even reflects light like a disc. But it's soft and elastic. Also, I saw another disc on his face. There were two of these on him. What's this? It's projecting something. The money I took from the sick inmates. They're mine now. All , dollars. No one will ever find them here. This image… McQueen. Would you like to cooperate as my partner? McQueen! What did I just see? It's as if I was watching someone's memory! I heard… you've been sneaking around asking about me. I've stalked before, but I've never been stalked by a woman. Yes, this is a first. And who the hell are you? I saw those discs sticking out of your face! Discs? What? I can't remember a thing! What discs? I'm such a loser! I can't remember a thing! What got you crying all of a sudden? You took my money at the infirmary. Just this morning! Money? That's right. I had a huge sum of money, and I hid it somewhere. But… I forgot where I hid it! Hey, are you all right? Are you messing with me? Did you just ask if I'm okay? How nice! It's been ages since I last spoke with a woman! No, it's a first. I've never had a heartfelt conversation with a woman before. I'm in bliss right now. I hope I can spend the rest of my life with a wonderful lady like you someday. What the hell? But that'll never happen. I'm pathetic, aren't I? Yes, I'm trash. I want to die. What… What the hell are you doing? What is this? This thing! STAND NAME: FREEWAY THRU HELL STAND MASTER: THUNDER MCQUEEN McQueen… You have pure evil within you. You have no malice or animosity. You think you don't inconvenience others. You victimize yourself, and you have no interest in others, yet you're always wishing for someone to save you. But that's precisely why you are the worst. You drag others down with you. You are the purest form of evil. I really like you, McQueen. If you ever find my enemies within these prison walls, you will surely clean them out and take care of them for me. Dammit! He hanged himself... and now my neck... Someone! Someone help! I'm passing out... Maybe if I bring his body down, my body will be lowered too? Sticker. He has strange powers like I do. So there are others like me! Dammit. Just who the hell are you? Why did you hang yourself? Did you save me? I owe my life to you. Who the hell are you? What do you want from me? I know you have some sort of ability! An ability? I don't know what you mean. But don't worry. I won't do that again. I can see clearly now. And I owe you for saving my life. I'll repay you someday. Don't worry about that. It was nothing. What the hell are you doing? What is this? Those scars… He must have suicidal tendencies! And he himself is unaware of his ability. This is bad. I'm even in the same position as him. Dammit, I'm farther away from him now. You bastard! Dammit! The disc! I don't understand what's going on, but it's got to do something with those discs! Let me die. I said I'd repay you, but a guy like me would never be able to do that because I'm trash! I don't want anything to do with you! Stay away from me, or I'll k*ll you! Please do! I wouldn't mind being k*lled by a beautiful woman like you! It looked like she picked up a disc from the bathroom floor. For some reason, I think it belonged to me. I wonder if she'll give it back. No, probably not. Let me pass! I have permission to leave. I'm returning to the women's prison. Dammit! I need to get as far away from that psycho as possible. I need to get back to my cell. I knew it. So your powers have awakened. I'll tell you one thing. That power that awakened within you… It's called a Stand ability. Stand abilities are drawn to one another like gravity. It happens without reason. That's why you ran into that janitor. Why is there a kid?! You picked up and sold Jolyne's charm. That's why she told me to keep an eye on you. You know Jolyne? What happened to her? Our enemy has the ability to steal souls. We are looking for a soul he stole. A soul? The culprit's name is Pale Snake. Please tell me anything you know. Soul? Could you be talking about this disc? That disc! This belongs to the janitor. What's the significance of these discs? Did he have two discs? Two discs? He did. A memory disc and a Stand disc. Discs come in pairs. Two discs make up a soul. If only we can get his other disc, we may be able to learn the identity of Pale Snake! Hell no… No way! It's still following me around. Dammit! I thought I got far enough. What's happening? Electricity! That bastard! He's electrocuting himself! It... It stopped. Electrical resistance. You can't k*ll a person just by sending  volts of electricity on human skin. We have electrical resistance. That's why it stopped. His su1c1de attempt failed. But… if he wants to electrocute himself again, he'd be looking around for some saline solution right about now. Saline solution would increase conductivity to almost  percent. Electricity can pierce and burn the heart completely. Saline solution? They are used as IVs and disinfectants. There's a bunch by the infirmary! I can't go any further. There are too many inmates by the stairs! I'll b*at him up and take his other disc. That's my only way! Stop! Don't do this! Look at my left arm! It's a little burnt, just like your arm. You have obtained a strange ability. Every su1c1de attempt is reflected onto me! Don't think about su1c1de! There are lots of fun and lucky things in life too! Four years ago, I was only cleaning. Cleaning the shotgun in my apartment. But for some reason, the g*n was loaded. The g*n accidentally fired. I live on the tenth floor. Just as the g*n went off, a woman jumped to k*ll herself. It was like the lottery. While some win millions of dollars, I guess sometimes the exact opposite happens. She was supposed to hit the ground and die. Everyone thought that I aimed at and k*lled the woman on the th floor. The judge even called me cold-blooded. That's the kind of man I am! Hold on! Oh, panties. Has anyone given you panties before? Wouldn't you feel lucky if a girl gave you her panties? You're going through tough times right now. But imagine. If a girl gives you panties, that means lucky things can happen even at the worst moment. Oh, I'm so embarrassed! But you can have it. I'll give you the one I got on right now! You'll really give me your panties? I keep my promises. But remember this. Everyone hates Mondays. We all hope for the fun Saturdays to come around. Not every day is a Monday! I was arrested on a Saturday. You're saying nice things to give me hope, but I bet it's just lip service to save yourself. That's not… You are pretending to be kind just to get out of this situation. You don't mean a word you say. Am I wrong? That's how everyone always treats me. Nobody likes trash. But I'm worse than trash. My presence is invisible to everyone! Hold on! Yes, I'm talking to you because I don't want to die. But listen up. You are being used by Pale Snake. He's exploiting your mindset! If you don't think about su1c1de, nothing will happen! You are the one who's being selfish, you bastard! You really are a nice person. How wonderful. Those words were sincere. I sure am fortunate. I ran into such a beautiful woman before my passing. Thank you! If I can die with you… If I can spend an eternity with you, then I'm really blessed! He's evil. He is, without a doubt, rotten to his core! I'm not lonely! -Here! -Bastard! Let go of that switch! That was close. Too close, dammit! I managed to attach the sticker. It'll burn from the sparks of electricity. Once the sticker burns off, the copy created with the sticker will… merge back to one! Goddammit. The shock made me remember. He hid the money he stole, , dollars. I'll take it as payment, you little sh*t. And then there's Pale Snake. I went through this because of him. Just what are you planning? ERMES COSTELLO, STAND NAME: "SMACK" I have to go see her. Jolyne… Jolyne Cujoh.
05x07 - There’s Six of Us!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:17His heart… Why isn't it b*ating? My dad's not dead. If I can get his Stand back, he'll surely come back to life. I'll tell you one thing. That power that awakened within you… It's called a Stand ability. I have to go see her. Jolyne… Jolyne Cujoh. PUNISHMENT WARD I see. So Ermes has learned about Stand abilities and about the discs too. When Ermes inserted McQueen's memory disc back into him, he came back to life. He was resuscitated. We may be able to bring your father back if we have his discs! And what did you do with this janitor's discs? I'm keeping them safe. I have both discs. She said the guards would find it during body checks if she brought them to her cell. I'll hold on to his Stand ability, but I'll insert his memory disc back later. McQueen's memory disc. This disc contains memories related to Pale Snake. And maybe memories of Dad's discs too. It's coming! Hurry, shut the door! I was only trying to change the tractor's tire! I barely touched it! Hurry! Hurry, get out of there! We need to close this door! Come on, help me! Okay! It's heavy! Pull harder! It's almost closed. Now, pull! What the hell are you doing? I said pull harder! Those aren't my arms… Bro! I know. I was the one… who didn't pull hard enough-- EPISODE : THERE'S SIX OF US! Fine weather, as always. Tell me, Charlotte, what is this commotion for? Why did we call this assembly? This afternoon, two inmates went missing on the farm grounds. Is that so? That's not good. The prisoners could not have escaped from the farm grounds. They must have drowned in the surrounding wetlands or gotten bitten by venomous snakes. I think we need to assemble a search party. Why don't you talk about the possibility of them being eaten by a crocodile? Maybe a female crocodile. Who was that? What did you say?! I did not eat them! I am innocent! Anyways. I have called you here to form a volunteer search party. You will not be compensated, nor will your sentence get shortened. I'd like to ask for your compassion. Are there any volunteers? Come on, Jolyne. You just got out of the Punishment Ward. Why would choose to tire yourself more? Because you won't be there. What? Very well. A party of five is plenty. Guard, bring the usual please. Inmates going to the farm must wear this on their wrists to prevent escape. "Like a Virgin." Also known as "invisible wall." In trying to take the bracelet cuffs off you give it impact, or if it breaks, it will explode immediately. Furthermore, if you stray farther than  meters from me, it will explode. It would be difficult to wipe your asses without your arms. Let's go, all five of you! Fifty meters? We're supposed to run? Wait up! Hey! All right, we'll split up here and start the search. The grassy area there is a marsh. There could be crocodiles, so watch out! They wouldn't be here. Why did you volunteer, Jolyne? Well, it works well for me. There are plenty of things I have to ask you. About the disc and about the guy named Pale Snake. Did you try it out? Did you read McQueen's disc? Yes, I gave it a try, but it made me feel terrible. It felt as if a stench was entering my brain. -Then you haven't noticed. -What? The image within the disc contained clues on Pale Snake's aim. McQueen. This disc will suit you. It's yours now. This is now your Stand ability. They're stored in one of the farm tractor tires? You saw a bunch of them there? His aim is to collect the discs. He was collecting Stand abilities and memories he stole from other Stand users. There are dozens of discs. He has to keep them hidden from the prison guards and other prisoners. That's why he has them hidden in a tire. My father's Star Platinum and memory discs might be stashed there. What? Father? So you're searching for your father's discs? Sorry, but I don't know anything more about him. I'll look for the tractor from the disc. A tractor? There's a good number of them here. -That shed. -Right. Hey! You two seem to be enjoying yourselves. You think this is a picnic or something? You're not searching at all! No, we were discussing that shed over there. We'll go search there. You made us run after you on purpose. Who's the one having fun here? Hold it! Did you mutter something? Oh, it's nothing. I swore to run around like a dog and search. I don't like her. Crocodile feces. I said hold it! You disrespectful bitch! I'm the guard here! Oops. That was an accident. The stick accidentally hit it, right? What is this sound? Why is my bracelet beeping? That wasn't on purpose. You ran into me. It won't explode, will it? That was a bad joke. Do something about it! Hey now, stay away from me. What if it explodes the moment you come near me? Hold on. I said I'm sorry! I'm apologizing! Watch it! I said don't come near me. I said, make it stop-- Boom! Yes! That's what you get! Eat crocodile sh*t! It stopped. Come on. Don't panic and trip, Ermes. That sound was a warning. Right, Mr. Prison Guard? Dammit… So that was your ability, huh? Come on. There's only a tractor and bags of flour in here. There's no point in looking inside. If this was an easy assignment, then there was no need for volunteers. Seriously? There it is, Jolyne! It's the same tractor. That's the same tractor I saw on the disc. The number is the same too. STAND NAME: STONE OCEAN STAND MASTER: JOLYNE CUJOH The same vehicle number. It says four. They're inside that tire. We can get to the discs if we remove the tire. Listen up! We will now sweep the wetlands! The missing inmates could have drowned in the waters. You will go look! Hey, there's no way I'm going in the water. I'm not going. Let's go! Guess that vehicle is amphibious. Give me a break. Who knows what sort of disease we'll catch in the wetlands! What a pain. Now's our chance. Let's remove the tire now! Hey, Jolyne. Doesn't something seem off? No, something is definitely wrong. Yes, if we don't remove the tire now, we would be separated from the guard. No, that's not what I mean. He said, "Five is plenty." That Warden. He said five inmates are enough. but there are six of us! Jolyne, what could this all mean? Including you and I… there's six of us here! I know there were only the five of us when we left. But I wasn't paying attention to how they looked. Jolyne, what do you think? I can't say. I was fixed on catching up. But then, everyone's wearing a bracelet. That's strange. Were there six of us right from the start? Hey, you think this is odd too? There should've been only five of us, right? Can you tell who joined us and when? No, I could be mistaken. And it doesn't matter how many of us there are. She's been with me the entire time. I remember her. She's Atroe. She gets picked on a lot. She volunteered to escape the bullying. Right? I don't know you. Hey! What's going on? Why is my bracelet beeping? Crap, mine is too! -Mine too. -What the hell? They're all beeping. We must be nearing the -meter limit. But he can't be that far off. The guard is gone! Where did he go? The ATV is covered in blood. Why is that? The bracelet won't stop beeping because the guard's body is getting farther away from us. Did he fall in the water and being washed away? Find the guard! He must be within  meters! This is bad! Hey. My bracelet's beeping faster! No way. She's dead. No way. Did the additional person att*ck? Is it because we got close to the discs? Look  meters away opposite from the girl that just exploded! There he is! Get near him! The bracelet will stop beeping and it won't explode either. Keep your guard up, Jolyne. Our enemy is among them. Someone's a real psycho. She looks suspicious to me. The woman with the shaved head. And Atroe didn't recognize her. It must be her. Her Stand ability must have k*lled him. We'll k*ll her before she gets us! Calm down, Ermes. Say that the shaved woman is the culprit, so she was guarding the discs in the shed since before we got here? That's what it would mean. That's impossible. She's an inmate. An inmate can't keep watch /. Jolyne, stand back! -Something's there! -What? Just step back. Get away from the water! Ermes. -Did you see something? -No. It was nothing. But I'm not getting in the marsh anymore. And Jolyne. We can't be separated, no matter what. We don't know who the enemy is. Right. And these bracelets complicate things. To take the discs from the shed, we must be within  meters of the guard and the other three inmates. Ermes! Something's in the bucket! My face got sucked in! What is this plankton-looking thing? What? It split into two. No, four! These creatures… The bucket wasn't empty. I didn't look hard enough. They were already in the water. Smack! Ermes! Jolyne, don't come in! The water is not safe! They're multiplying! They can rapidly multiply. Get out of the water. You won't make it in time. I fell into the Stand's trap. Stone Ocean! I'll get him now. Jolyne. You're walking on the thread? Doesn't that mean you're unraveling your own body? Jolyne, stay away! I'll take care of myself! This is crazy! It's true. Yes, it's pretty crazy. Good grief. I would've been toast if I hadn't unraveled so much thread. So this is your power. Her body has a hole in it. She let him punch her so she could grab onto him. Jolyne, get out of the water now. Don't stand up, Ermes! That thing. It's a bunch of small Stands clustered together! It hid inside the tiny bit of water in the bucket, and it dragged me in! I know that. So don't stand up. Grab it underwater. The thread that I'm releasing! It's fast. It's powerful too, but its speed... Just what is it? A Stand's speed and power should weaken… the farther it separates from its user. It got me! Stay calm, Jolyne. I put my sticker on it. When I was caught in its arms earlier. This is my Stand ability. I'll peel it off now! Run further inland! It's not coming onto land. Seems it only att*cks in the water. Please respond! This is inmate FE. This is an emergency. The guard got in an accident. Send help immediately! What happened to you two? It looked like you were running on water… You three, don't take another step! Step away from the water! Don't try to pull anything on us. I know one of you did this! In order to obtain the discs, it seems we have to defeat the User first.
05x08 - Foo Fighters / F.F.QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:18You three, don't take another step! Step away from the water! Don't try to pull anything on us. I know one of you did this! Did what? The one who k*lled the guard and tried to drown us! I know it's one of you! We really need to figure out who snuck in, or we're all toast! What are you talking about? I said don't move. Atroe said she didn't recognize you. What about you two? Do you recall seeing her from the start? I don't recall your faces either. Come on, you know I've been here right from the start. I don't remember your face. Hey! No one remembers you either, bitch. I'm the one who called help over the radio just now. You could be trying to trick us. Wait a second. You, with the black hair. You've got a nosebleed. What the… I couldn't see well, but… Ermes, when I punched the enemy Stand earlier, someone almost collapsed. Step back. Stand away from the water. Hold on, you've got it all wrong! This bitch punched my face just now! Look at her! She's bleeding too. What the hell? Her tooth scratched my arm! I was definitely here right from the start. The culprit is one of these two! Listen, I remember what happened with that crocodile warden! You're the one who caused a scene! She did do that. You guys are just as suspicious… Jolyne! Was it this bitch that att*cked us? How did you figure it out? Well, to be honest, I have no clue who the k*ller is. So I'll just b*at you all up! You… You bitch! She's… I was going to finish you off one by one in the water. Who would've guessed she had a thread ability and would survive the att*ck? Just what are these people? They all k*lled him? What's going on? Who's the actual Stand User? You're wrong. One Stand User for each Stand ability. The women who were here from the start were the black-haired and the shaved-head one. I finished them off because they approached the tractor. I then took over their body and mind. This body, I created it… using the missing inmates' flesh! EPISODE : F.F. The black sludge is gathering from those two. The divided parts of me have now formed into one. For the ability and the intellect Pale Snake's discs have enabled me, I will protect myself at any cost. It is my duty to eliminate those who approach the storage shed. Dammit. Where is the Stand User? You're misunderstanding it, Ermes. He is the Stand User himself. What? He is an organism. He is a living creature who received life and power through the discs. The guard of the discs wasn't human. A living creature? You mean, that conglomeration of those tiny things? It must be using the water in the bodies of its victims to move on land and guard the shed. It stays on land by dividing and multiplying. However, as a car needs gasoline, it needs water to live. To acquire the discs, we need to keep this creature out of the water and defeat it! But Jolyne, how can a tiny flea-like thing talk? F.F. Call me by my name! An astronomer named Fred Hoyle once said, "It is probabilistically wrong to assume that life was born spontaneously on Earth. The power of intellect already existed in this universe, and it created the origin of life." Meaning intellect existed long before the Big Bang, and all substances and organisms already possessed intellect. What is he blabbering on about? He's trying to say that humans are not the only ones with intellect. Even plankton have memory-- I told you to call me F.F.! I am a being of superior intellect than you! This is bad. He's trying to hide the discs before we can get to them. If he buries them underground, we'll never be able to find them! Jolyne, we're in trouble here. Look behind you. That's the creature that att*cked us from the water. He's trying to drag the guard's body. Remember the bracelet? We must stay within  meters of it. It's over, Jolyne. Let's give up on the discs. We must get the guard's body! The bracelet will explode. I'll leave the bracelet to you, Ermes. What? While I run  meters, you protect the guard's body and drag it within my safety range! That's the only way! Hey, I said wait! What a woman. She's nuts! Why would she leave that to me? But, dammit. If it takes the guard's body, then it's over for Jolyne and me. I need to act now! I did it, dammit. But I'll never use the sticker like this ever again. I'll never create another arm for myself. This will hurt, dammit. I just have to carry him within  meters of the shed… Water. You little worm! That holler… You think you've won? This is the corpse your original dried out to the bone. This corpse has zero moisture. My sticker has split it into two. When I remove the sticker… You sure absorb water like a tampon. Or should I say, a drop of water in a desert? Shut up! You're in the way! Scram! Jolyne. We need to dehydrate it. That's the only way to win against these tiny bastards. You made it in time. Either way, I will k*ll you two. I was planning to ask you questions after hiding these discs. But very well. Let me ask you this. Will you jump into the puddle? Or will you try to run? Which death do you prefer? I have questions as well. The one who knows what you are. Is it Pale Snake? Also, what is his aim and reason for collecting the discs? How interesting. I understand the logic behind an offensive defense. And fighting to protect your friends, I can't relate, but it's also within reason. However, I don't understand why you'd come here to die. Well, Pale Snake, was it? Who knows? I've never seen him. You thought I was distracted, you fool? These puddles are already a part of me! Did you plan to break this bag of flour and absorb water? Either way, I fully understand my ability and have created the optimal environment for myself. It may not be so bad to use your body as a host for a while. No. You've already lost. This environment you've created by spilling water everywhere… It will lead to your defeat. You didn't even hear me start the tractor using my threads. The sound was drowned by the water. You got distracted with k*lling me. And now, you've failed to guard the discs. You… Damn you! I cannot allow you to have them! Those discs are my… The dirt in the field is much softer than that of the wetlands. Water is getting absorbed from its body. And there won't be water at the end point! I won't let you lay a single finger on those discs-- Jolyne won this battle of wits. The discs don't belong to you anymore. You're finished! Dry up and become feed for the crops! Jolyne. Jolyne, what the hell are you doing? I'll give it water. Let's just say, I'm saving it. What? F.F. He wasn't guarding the discs out of loyalty to Pale Snake. I know that now. Though it knows its body will wither away, it chased after the discs. It was guarding the discs to protect its own existence. The discs gave it ability and intellect. It risked his life for the gratitude it has, to be able to exist. It could care less about Pale Snake. Hey, you want to save it? It k*lled five people! And it's literally not human! If it's not human, then it doesn't understand evil. Pale Snake is the evil one. Pale Snake only gave it the information that would allow him to take advantage. What? And I have another reason for saving its life. I made a deal with you. These discs, I want you to keep them safe. But do it for us. Keep them out of Pale Snake's hands. My intention is not to take those discs from you. I only want my father's discs back. And I want to know what Pale Snake is scheming to do. Well? Will you help us? But no more k*lling humans. Dammit. You really are something. I don't quite understand your feelings, but I no longer feel like fighting. And, I have lost… completely. DISC OBTAINED SUNBURN (NO CORPSE) SHAVED-HEAD (NO CORPSE) BLACK-HAIRED (BONE-DRY CORPSE) ATROE (DEATH FROM expl*si*n) STAND NAME: F.F. STAND MASTER: F.F. So the discs really were stored in the tire! We finally found them! This is Star Platinum! Jolyne! Are you okay? Hey! I have no doubt about it. This is Star Platinum's disc. My father, Jotaro Kujo, can be resuscitated with it. It's finally in my hand! But I don't see his memory disc. Where could it be? Hey. If I jump out of that window, do you think I'll die? Come on, it's just me. It's me! F.F., just call me that. I recovered whatever remained of her. I wore another inmate's bracelet. I want to use this body as a host for a while. This hand is useless, though. Take over her life? You mean, you'll live in her cell as a prisoner? Jolyne, I want to protect you. According to the memory in this body, her name is Atroe. Inmate number FE. Her childhood dream was to get kidnapped. But when she grew up, she ended up kidnapping a child. She wasn't after the ransom. She doesn't know why she did it. What the… Your arms are bleeding. Do they hurt? But I can't heal them. -What the hell? -Gross! Water! You might want to wait on going inside the prison. How about practicing drinking from a cup first? A cup? That's a piece of cake! Drinking from a cup is nothing. Gross. Hey, I wanted to ask you about Pale Snake. Does he come to this shed often? No, he barely swings by. I've never seen his user either. The discs stored here are the ones he doesn't use. No matter how strong the Stand, the body rejects the disc if you're incompatible. So all the discs are the ones he cannot use. He must have another hiding place for the important ones. And that's why the memory disc you're seeking isn't in this pile. What he really wanted from your father wasn't an invincible Stand ability but his memory. It must be one hell of a secret. Secret… The guards are here. What are you going to do, Jolyne? You have the Star Platinum disc. My next step is to deliver this to the foundation treating my father. If I don't resuscitate him soon, his body will begin to rot. And I'll find his memory disc no matter what it takes. Deliver it outside of this prison. It's harder to get things out of here than in. And the guards will soon conduct a body check. Let me see that disc for a sec. I'll just make my boobs a bit bigger. Ta-da. F.F., raise your hands or you'll get sh*t. Ermes, you too. The guard was att*cked by a crocodile. We saved him. We don't know what happened to the other inmates. That's the story we're sticking to, okay? She was just bait. Jolyne was just bait to attract Jotaro. I believed she would be harmless. Jolyne Cujoh. Did she defeat the guard by herself and take the discs? Could it be that the surviving inmates aided Jolyne? Hey, it's already sundown. You must return to the prison soon. Are you that worried about the missing inmates, Father Pucchi? A moment, please. I will be staying here until I give the sacrament on Sunday.
05x09 - Debt Collector Marilyn Manson / Debt Collector Mary Lynn MansonQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:18Father, my incarceration has taught me how foolish I had been in the past. I couldn't restrain my greed and continued to steal. I'm ashamed of myself. It's all thanks to you, Father. Could I please ask for your assistance in receiving parole? Recent studies have revealed… that proper training can teach even dogs and parrots how to read, utilize fire, and understand art. If that is the case, then what is the difference between man and animal? What do you think? I'm not sure. Anyway, about my parole… Excuse me. -Hey. -Got it. The point is, after finishing the first cherry and leaving it in your mouth, which tooth would you bite the second with? You must not bite the first pit while eating the second cherry. Sure… And what about my parole? I think there's a possibility. Do you really, Father? I will recommend you to the committee. Thank you, Fa-- I quite like your mischievous habit of theft. Truly, an evil disposition cannot be corrected. However, I cannot deny this talent. You will prove useful to me. I cannot let Jotaro's Stand leave this prison, after all. EPISODE : DEBT COLLECTOR MARY LYNN MANSON What the hell? What do you mean F.F. is hiding it? It's an important disc containing your father's Stand, right? Are you fine with not knowing where she's hiding it? -How do we know we can-- -This place is fun! -It's not like the wetlands at all! -Really, now. I want to play too. It's called "catch," right? I trust F.F., and Pale Snake doesn't know that she's alive. It's the safest place. You're right. But it would be even better if you could deliver the disc to him. I know. But I'm not allowed visitors or phone calls because I attempted to escape. And I don't have a plan to carry it out yet. Hey, you! That's my drink! What's the matter with you? I'm thirsty. Put that cup back on the bench now! If it's that important to you, then don't put it down. Especially in here. F.F., I'll bring you more water! Don't cause any trouble! Give it back! Oh, well. I ended up with more water. Lucky me! All right, let's get back to playing. -Jeez. -What? You've never thrown a ball, have you? Oh, crap. Tuck your hips in. A bit more. You got it. Your form's looking better already. Jolyne, did you know that we've tossed the ball  times now? We haven't dropped it at all. Think we can reach a hundred? A hundred dollars says it won't last. I bet  dollars. Sorry, but who are you? What do you mean  dollars? I'm Miraschon, inmate FE. I'm betting  dollars that you won't be able to make it to the th throw. Where did that come from, all of a sudden? I'm just k*lling time. Let's do it! We only have  more throws! You keep quiet! I don't have that kind of money. I can't match this wager. You can bet any item. Tobacco, dr*gs, gum, a phone call, a vibrator… I'll accept anything valuable. Let me be frank. I'm not betting on anything. Hold it. Jolyne, we should accept this bet. It's a chance to make money. You can use my money. F.F. might suck at playing catch, but still managed to continue to . We can win! Come on, Ermes. You suspect that this is Pale Snake's trap. But I know that Miraschon because we're on the same floor. She's the greedy self-destructive type that kept committing petty theft. Think about it. Even after your restrictions get lifted, you need to buy your time on the phone. So, gonna play or not? I want to give it a go! We can win this! Good. But you don't have  dollars, do you? If you raise your voice or get too close, the bet is immediately off. Got it? The wager has already begun. But it wouldn't be fair for me if you play too close or hold onto the ball too long. We'll stay at least three meters away and throw within ten seconds. Good. Time to play ball! Let's go. Don't rush and take your aim. You have a whole ten seconds before you throw! Eighty-nine. Only  more throws to go! Bitch, stay away from my cup! F.F.! That was close. Come on, focus! It wasn't my fault! It's her! She got near my water! I'm just enjoying the show. Just stay away from my cup! All right. Five more seconds. F.F., throw the ball! -Damn, she's distracting me! -Hey! I'll hold your cup for you. -One second left. -F.F.! Idiot! Jolyne! That was close, but she caught it. Sorry, I panicked. Be careful next time, F.F. I'm fine now! See? A hundred throws! Good. I can go another hundred throws! See? An easy win. Now, give us the  dollars. Hold on, she made a wager with F.F. too. That makes it  dollars. That's true. She owes us  dollars. Now, cough it up. A thousand dollars if you throw a hundred more. You heard me. I said let's play for , dollars. Are you serious? Do you even have that much money? Of course, I do. But like I said, I'll take anything valuable too. The rules will be the same as last time. What do you say? No, I'm done playing with you. I'm going to be frank. There's something I don't like about you. -If you want to wager, go play else-- -I'll play. Good. F.F., hand me the glove and the ball. -Okay! -Ermes, no! Jolyne, you're right, she is suspicious. Especially the way she insists on betting. But… we can potentially make , dollars. There's no way we can pass that up. Be careful, though. The game begins the moment you agree to play. Might be  seconds soon. -Ermes! -F.F.! More easy money. Thirty. Thirty-one. Thirty-two. Great, the next one makes it . Inmates, put away your exercise equipment! Recess time is over! Five… F.F.! Thirty-three! Bitch! What's with that attitude?! Hey, this bet is off. Got that? Let's say that a meteorite falls from the skies above into this yard right now. Then, you'll persuade to end the game, blaming it on the meteorite. Not to convince me, but yourselves. Does that sit well with you, though? Maybe you ran out of time because you took too long to throw the ball. If you can honestly say that you didn't break the rules of the game, then go ahead, end this game. Dammit… Ermes, you know you'll be thrown in the Punishment Ward. Please, mister. Give me five… No, three minutes. I'll make another round, so finish up in two minutes. F.F., hurry! But a measly  dollars only pays for the ball. I'm putting the glove away. Give it to me! What? Goddammit! sh*t… I attached a sticker to it in case something like this happens! Ermes! Whoa! Let's keep playing. I'm just watching. I won't interfere or object. And I can't prove anything, but… Ermes… She knows what she's done. Without a doubt, she violated the rules of the game just now. I know this because Mary Lynn Manson, the debt collector, appeared. Ermes! She's a Stand User! Mary Lynn Manson will always collect the debt no matter where you hide it, or what it is. All of it. That's not enough. Smack… It's game over. Ermes! Ermes… If I sell this liver on the black market, it will compensate for the remaining  dollars. Bastard! Take this! I am the shadow of Ermes's conscience. You cannot att*ck me. Ermes broke the rules and lost the bet. I only collected her debt. If you have any other valuables, I can exchange it for this liver. The bet's not over yet. What? One thousand throws. If I win, give back everything you took from her. Everything. Good. However, I hope you are prepared to wager something as valuable. I'm aware. Very well. The game has already started. I shall see you again. F.F.! Jolyne. Ermes, this wasn't your fault. Miraschon is a Stand User. Pale Snake must have a hand in this. She must be here to collect my father's disc from me. Then you really shouldn't play this game. You got caught in me and my father's problem. I can't let you die. But what are you going to do? A thousand throws? That Stand seems invincible. You're right. We'll chase Miraschon herself and b*at her! The Stand may be invincible, but Miraschon isn't. That's why she ran. Let's go! She's here. She must have entered this room. There's a door to the back. Maybe she escaped that way. F.F.! Jolyne, don't throw it yet! Crap! F.F.! It's coming towards you! Where is it? I can't see a thing! Don't move! The ball will hit you! Whoa! I got it! That was too close! Great job, F.F. Now, calm down so you can throw it back. I'm right here! -Where are you? -Hurry! It's over for them. F.F.! I don't have time for this! F.F. I sh*t towards the direction of her voice. I didn't even aim! Dammit! What is she? Lockdown will soon commence. All inmates must return to their cells. Prepare for headcount. I repeat! She ran to the right! How unfortunate. You can't run anymore. Now that we know that you are a Stand User, I won't hold back. Wait, I'll give it all back. The liver… and the money too! That's not enough. Who gave you that Stand ability? What? Pale Snake. It was him, wasn't it? I want to know who his User is. What are you talking about? You shouldn't test me. I'm serious! I only wanted to go on parole! What is this? This is an elevator for transporting cafeteria food. How many more seconds? Six… No, is it five? Jolyne! Two seconds left… F.F, the ball! Throw it to me! Dammit! What's your next move? Eight seconds left. Seven, six… F.F.! Will this do, Miraschon? Such an easy and simple request. Feel free to ask me again. The game of catch was just interrupted. It's game over, Jolyne Cujoh! Mary Lynn Manson will always collect what's owed! No matter where it is, even if you don't know where, Mary Lynn knows where it is. Jolyne! I'll take the most expensive organ. And for the remainder, your most prized possession, your father's disc. And the disc… was on her since the beginning! I won! Your organ, your disc… They're all mine now! The game of catch isn't over yet. But how? The ball… Impossible. -You broke the rules. -No. We never agreed on my partner. The guard is okay too, right? The debt collector agrees with me. How many throws do I have left? Is it ? Or ? It's a pain to count. Let's say , throws. We did it! MIRASCHON STAND: DEBT COLLECTOR MARY LYNN MANSON OUT OF COMMISSION I will return the disc to my father. Along with the other disc that Pale Snake has. No matter what.
05x10 - Operation Savage Garden (Head to the Courtyard!) (1) / Operation Savage Guardian (Head to the Courtyard!) (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:20We finally found them! This is Star Platinum! Jolyne Cujoh. Did she defeat the guard by herself and take the discs? I will return the disc to my father. Along with the disc held by Pale Snake… No matter what. Of course. All memories relating to myself have been deleted from Miraschon's disc. Therefore, no one will be able to track it to me. The difference between humans and animals, is that humans seek heaven. Humans ought to lead a life that leads them to heaven. This is what makes humans beautiful. EPISODE : OPERATION SAVAGE GUARDIAN (HEAD TO THE COURTYARD!), PART  -Soap. -Here's my rent. I want the most expensive watch you got. Move. I'm using the phone next. What? Are you crazy, bitch? I'll take real good care of-- Take a seat! You won't get tired! Here's a complimentary drink. Feel free to ask me again. This is The Speedwagon Foundation HQ in Dallas, Texas. We do not accept collect calls on this number. I looked up the number in a phonebook. I only have this number. And I'm an inmate at the Green Dolphin Street State Prison in Florida. My name is Jolyne Cujoh. Please connect me to someone who knows what this means. Please hold. Thank you for waiting. Are you Professor Jotaro Kujo's daughter? And you are? I am just a foundation representative. And I am not a Stand User. I see. But you seem to know about Stand abilities. Do you know about the discs? Yes, of course. After retrieving Dr. Jotaro Kujo's body from the UUV, he has been sheltered, not here in Dallas, but somewhere safe. I am so sorry to inform you of this, but your father is medically unresponsive. If I say that we can bring him back to life, will you believe me? I am merely a scientist. I cannot comment. I have obtained a disc. Just one of them. We can bring him back. I just know that the discs will bring him back. I'll do whatever it takes to deliver them to you. I just don't know how to do it. I want you to come up with a plan to deliver the discs there. Immediately. Isn't this conversation being recorded by the prison? Yes, probably. But that's a risk I'm willing to take. I have no time. This is urgent. I'm in a dangerous situation where I cannot hide the disc anywhere. There must be a way. And just so you know, I am not allowed visitors. I understand. Since you insist… What about the courtyard? The courtyard? Do you mean the courtyard between the men's and women's prisons? Yes. Please be there in  minutes. I can manage something. In  minutes? From now? Yes. You said this is urgent. If you instruct us to retrieve the discs, we will do everything we can to do so. If you say he will be revived, we believe you. However, we are a non-militaristic medical research foundation. We neither have the resources nor the ability to help you escape or save your life. Is that risk acceptable to you? Okay. I'll be there. And how will you retrieve the disc? We shouldn't speak of that over the phone. But please look for Savage Guardian. You will understand then. Let's call it Operation Savage Guardian for now. Savage Guardian… Is that an object? Or is it a person? Fine. I need to head to the courtyard. I'm at the cafeteria of the women's prison. To get to the courtyard, first, I must pass through the gate, go up the stairs in the back, cross the second floor corridor to get to the medical wing from the women's prison. You may pass. FE, you're the nuisance who got sent to the Punishment Ward. Your access to different parts of the facility is restricted. Jolyne. Emporio! Here! Do not touch the ball. We can't let others see us. Come with me. Wha… Emporio, those two… It's fine, they can be trusted. He prefers to sleep on a bed, but this room doesn't have one. So he ends up sleeping in the piano. Jolyne, I live in secret in this ghost of a room. Ghost of a room? Does that mean you're… No, Jolyne. He and I are alive. We aren't ghosts. You can touch us. We're warm and have pulses. Listen closely. Ghosts do not live here, but the building itself is a ghost. What? Does "the ghost of objects" make sense? This prison caught fire in  and went through a huge renovation. This room b*rned down in that fire. This room belongs in the past. It's a ghost of the music room. So… this means… Emporio, are you… Ever since I was born, I've been able to materialize the ghosts of objects. That's my Stand ability. But I can only use them. So even this chocolate bar and this orange juice… I can't consume them. But they still have a taste. They're quite good. What? Don't worry. This clock stopped when it b*rned along with the room. You still have time before your  minutes are up. But… you made a plan to deliver the disc over the phone. How reckless! I understand your situation. Pale Snake will learn about this. Please, Emporio. Tell me how I can reach the courtyard. Don't misunderstand me. I can't access just any place from this ghost room. I use the ghost items like this to get around without getting caught. I know you have no choice. He says he wants to tag along. You should take him. He can aid your cause. His name is Weather Forecast. This is a music room. Don't be so alarmed. Weather doesn't talk much because he has no memory. -Memory? -Yes. He has no memory of his childhood or when he arrived here. He's serving a six-year sentence. He has a habit of walking on tip-toes. He's a TV guide fanatic, but he doesn't watch TV. When he talks, he barely opens his mouth. And he talks right up to your face, so you may feel his lukewarm breath. He has no memory? Is that because Pale Snake stole them from him? Probably. He wants to learn about himself. He also wants to know why Pale Snake wants your father's discs. He says his Stand ability is not tied to the discs. He was born a Stand User. As for his ability… he can manipulate the weather to his will. His Stand name is… Weather Forecast. Pretend you didn't notice him. Someone was peeking to see where the music was coming from. Now it's confirmed. Someone knows you made a move and came to check on you. And we now know his face. STAND NAME: JUMPIN' JACK SPARK STAND MASTER: LANG RANGLER Dammit. He's already close. But if he's a Stand User, we need to take care of him now! No, Jolyne. We should hide for now. He doesn't know that you're headed for the courtyard. He didn't hear your phone call and that's why came to eavesdrop! If he knew, he would have waited at the courtyard. That's why, right now, he's chasing us! What's up with him? Turn into that corner before he gets any closer. Hurry! Just as I thought. He doesn't know where you're going yet. But what's with him? He had a weird way of running. We were able to hide because he's slow. Anyway, you need to head to the courtyard. Your phone call earlier was definitely recorded, but I don't think Pale Snake heard it yet. The sooner you go, the less dangerous it'll be. The medical wing is up ahead. Once you go downstairs and pass the medical wing, there's a gate for the corridor. It leads to the factory. It also leads to the men's prison across the courtyard. The medical wing is accessed by both men and women. Weather Forecast is a man, so if tells a guard he's going back to the men's prison, he'll have no problem getting to the connecting corridor and getting to the factory entrance. Go on ahead. I need to bribe the guards, right? Is  dollars enough? Tell them you want your boots repaired at the factory. But even if you manage to pass the medical wing, you'll have to get to the courtyard by force. The security is light, but if you get caught, they'll sh**t. and you'll get five more years for trying to escape. By force, huh? Guess I have to get used to using it. I just have to go. Another five years is nothing at this point. Thank you, Emporio. Right. This is the most I can do. Please revive him. If your father comes back to life, then I think I might be able see some hope. Oh, dammit. What's wrong with this cola? You touched the can, didn't you? Did you shake the can? Get me another one, will you? Oh, I didn't touch it. I only touched the plate. My shoe's got a hole on it. Over in the back. Can you see it? I wanted to get it repaired at the factory. Oh, man, my cola spilled. Where did I put that washrag? "Go get a cola"? You really want me to get one? And you want me to pour it into this cup? Do that yourself why don't you… What's going on? Oh, here's the washrag. You can go. But make sure to be back here in  minutes… Oh, she already left. What? Where's my cup and the plate? What's happening? Could it be… This is… The plate is floating! The cup and the boot as well. But, the contents of the cup aren't spilling out. It turns into balls of liquid and floats! Everything I touch is floating upwards! That money must have floated out of that guard's pocket! I'm in the air too. Since when that strange guy started chasing me...? He spit at me then. Did that cause this? The disc! Dammit. It slipped out when I rotated! Stone Ocean! My thread! I can't control it! There is no up and down. There's no gravity! I'm in zero gravity! You're going back to the men's prison? Okay. Go ahead. This is bad! He'll take my disc! If I try to punch, I'll lose my balance. I need to focus. Aim in a single direction like a rocket! What? Dammit. I can't destroy this disc. It just comes back like rubber. That's why Pale Snake told me to just collect it. Hold on! Weather Forecast, don't go any further! Can you hear me? I'm being att*cked! He took my disc. If we lose him now, everything is over. Everything will end! Don't let him go! No… My voice can't reach him. What a nuisance. Jolyne Cujoh, I thought I only needed to k*ll you. Jumpin' Jack Spark! Weather Forecast, his ability takes away gravity. Do not touch whatever it is he projects. You'll become weightless! Zero gravity. So you are a Stand User yourself. Surely, you understand the implications of my ability. He projected pieces of junk. Weather Forecast. This man, who is said to control the weather, is a mystery to me. But that cloud-like thing must be a layer of air. He used its resistance to deflect the enemy's att*ck. And he's using centrifugal force to spin his arm. It's weightless, it can accelerate forever with that spinning force. His body's center of gravity won't change, so he can accurately project a powerful att*ck. Jumpin' Jack Spark! Weather Forecast! This flame! Aerodynamic friction? Dammit, it's spreading! Zero gravity, deactivate! Meet your end! Corridor B. Emergency alarm activated. Dammit. That impact… And I have the disc, too! The gate is closing. What do I do? It's even harder to get to the courtyard now. But I have no choice. The enemy will be trapped too! This is my chance to get back the disc! What the hell?! Everything you touch… becomes weightless… Right? Jolyne Cujoh? The courtyard is just ahead. But where did he go? I need to get the disc back!
05x11 - Operation Savage Garden (Head to the Courtyard!) (2) / Operation Savage Guardian (Head to the Courtyard!) (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:21I have obtained a disc. Just one of them. We can bring him back. I just know that the discs will bring him back. Let's call it Operation Savage Guardian for now. You should take him. He can aid your cause. His name is Weather Forecast. Jumpin' Jack Spark! Weather Forecast! But where did he go? I need to get the disc back! EPISODE : OPERATION SAVAGE GUARDIAN (HEAD TO THE COURTYARD!) () Emergency alarm activated. Corridor B. -Yes, that's correct. Corridor B. -Emergency alarm activated. We are awaiting reports. Did something happen? We aren't sure as of yet. But Corridor B's sole function is for access to the factory. There is no possibility that it is a fire or a prisoner riot. Rest assured. Yes, indeed. I trust this prison and the prisoners. With all the commotion, curiosity got the better of me. Surely, you are aware that no prisoner has managed to escape from this prison for  years. Furthermore, the courtyard is outside of Corridor B. No prisoner would choose to escape from there, of all places. You're quite right. Leave the rest to us, Father. I'll be off then. Just one more thing out of curiosity… Is the clock on the wall accurate? Yes, of course. It is now : a.m. It's almost lunchtime. : a.m.  A call to The Speedwagon Foundation. I have the usual request. I'd like access to the collect call list and the recorded conversations. Women's prison, phone booth . The call from about seven minutes ago. Weather Forecast. Since you touched me, you are now weightless too. I don't see our enemy anywhere. We need to retrieve the disc right away. Stay calm. He must be within this laundry room. He is lurking somewhere. The courtyard is past that door. You are trying to reach that door, but it is most likely locked. You might need to blast it, or force it open somehow. There's... A slight problem... I know now's not the time for this… It's a personal thing… But it's urgent, and I need to go now. So, like… I don't know why it suddenly so suddenly. But, well… It's something that happens to everyone! What is this about? Well, it's the P-word related to the pelvic area. I'm just glad it's not "number two." You know, the biological phenomenon! You need to take a piss? No need to say it up close. I'm serious. I need to go. Just pick any corner. Dammit, why did I even try talking to a guy about this? I have relieved myself already. See? It's floating over there. In zero gravity, the blood in your body will suddenly collect in your head. Blood that is usually in the lower parts of the body due to gravity. The space between the skin and the bone is swollen and squishy with blood. It's called a "moon face." However, it's dangerous when too much blood goes to your head. The kidney automatically works harder to reduce the amount of blood. This triggers an acute diuretic effect. It attempts to thin the blood content by expelling salt. -But-- -Don't worry. I'll use my clouds to absorb your urine. What? Hey, wait, what are these droplets? They're leaking out of your cloud! Weather Forecast! No, that's not it. It's being sucked out through the gap in the wall! Me too. Blood from the wound I got earlier. My nose won't stop bleeding! I'm having difficulty breathing… No, it can't be! Jolyne! Everything I touch becomes zero gravity. I touched the walls leading to the door. That means the whole room is unaffected by gravity! The air! Air can't stay in zero gravity! It'll get pulled by the surrounding gravity, and it'll escape! We need to close up the gap! Otherwise, we'll suffocate to death! Jolyne, you're wrong. Suffocation isn't our primary concern. The blood in our bodies will boil first, leading to our death. In a vacuum, blood boils up like water. In a zero-gravity vacuum, people's blood will dry up in  seconds, before even suffocating. I'll reload my b*ll*ts. We'll get sh*t. We must hide somewhere! What are you saying? I'm bleeding out of my nose! We need to stop the air! Weather Forecast! Just take shallow breaths. I gathered what little air is remaining in this room, and covered our bodies with clouds. Cloud suits. The room is almost a complete vacuum. This is all the remaining air. Your nosebleed has stopped. How long can we keep breathing? I wish I didn't have to answer that. I'd say about two minutes. It's a cloud suit on the verge of death. If we don't defeat our enemy within that time, we'll be thrown into the vacuum, right? Precisely. Where is he? We must find him. Whether we act or not, his att*ck will finish us both. Hey, now that my nosebleed has stopped, I notice something. Listen, Jolyne. I said two minutes, but it could be one! We must find him immediately! Carbon dioxide is increasing as we speak! The laundry hampers. They aren't floating. The hampers over there. I touched the walls, shutters, and floor of this room. That's why the whole room entered zero gravity, and everything is floating. But why are those hampers and barrels not floating, and attached to the floor? Also, that enemy. How is he breathing in a vacuum? Shouldn't his blood be boiling over? In other words, that's the range of his ability. There is a distance range to this zero gravity. It's not the entire room! An att*ck range! From here to the hampers is about  meters or so. Zero gravity ends there. If we can get there, there will surely be normal air! You must go, Weather Forecast. He is outside of the vacuum range. If you do not control the air now, we will never reach our enemy. You may be correct. Outside that hamper… Go, Weather Forecast. The pressure in the suit is becoming strange. Go before this cloud suit disperses into the vacuum! Don't think you can get out of my att*ck range! He's gonna sh**t him down! I won't let you! I'll protect Weather Forecast! STAND NAME: WEATHER FORECAST STAND MASTER: WEATHER FORECAST He's coming around us! I'll charge ahead! He's going to reach air in a few meters. Once Weather Forecast gets air, he's going to corner you! If you want air that bad, you can have it. No need to even reach the hampers. I just now completed my att*ck. I wasn't trying to ricochet the b*ll*ts to injure him. I sh*t the barrel itself! A bit of air is left in the barrel. Highly pressurized air on the verge of expl*si*n, that is! Weather Forecast! He was pushed back to zero gravity. He is done for. He won't be able to gain enough force to stop the momentum. Weather Forecast! This is it. The suit itself is about to collapse! Jolyne! How reckless! You must go back! He'll sh**t you down! That thrust itself will dissipate your suit! She makes incredibly quick decisions. She charged into that bastard to stop his movement, and to push him outside of the zero gravity again! However, I won't let you through! I already know. Your Stand is very powerful. My rotating b*ll*ts aren't fast enough, and would get flicked away in defense. That's why I've been preparing. I've looked for them. I'd captured them away from view. There were quite a lot. Rats! They're alive! Could they be… Stone Ocean! Push them away! I can't see! Okay! I did not expect you to fight against my ability like this. This is checkmate. You're finished, Jolyne Cujoh! My mission is now complete! Jumpin' Jack Spark is the best. I feel invincible. I'm glad I was imprisoned here. With this ability I obtained here, there is nothing I can't do in this world. My future is rosy! I will hand this disc over to Pale Snake. I can defeat him too, if I wanted to. WIth my own hands! I knew it… I knew you'd do it. I was waiting for you to reload. I was waiting with my threads ready for you to reload your g*n. And you sh*t at me. These threads! When the hell did you do this?! Stone Ocean! What? You are the one in a complete vacuum. And now, without a suit, your blood will boil up and explode faster than us! We won! If you don't want to die, you must deactivate the zero gravity immediately! Dammit! The crime that put me in this prison… How many times did I s*ab her? When I k*lled the female professor, the prosecutor said I stabbed her  times. That compulsion. It's surging within me once more. sh*t. I won't let you underestimate me. That bitch! A reaction between hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide produces oxygen. Just like the oxygen in this bottle, it keeps coming out! My urge to slaughter someone like back then! Take this! I'll make a headstone out of your piss-soaked body with this glass! Jolyne Cujoh, your blood vessels will rupture first since you are covered in wounds! I got incarcerated for m*rder. I will k*ll you and leave this place an invincible man! Take this. This will be sufficient just to take the disc back from that bastard. Weather Forecast! What? Dammit! My body is at its limit! If I deactivate my ability, the air will rush in. I may be able to escape using the impact! Zero gravity, deactivate! Jumpin' Jack Spark! You should've deactivated it the first chance you had. The change in air pressure might have let you escape. If only you had deactivated it while you still had distance from Stone Ocean. The air is blowing you back toward me! How much longer until The Speedwagon Foundation arrives? Three minutes? Or two minutes? There is a corridor past this door. Alongside the right wall, there are windows that look out to the courtyard. There, you'll be able to see a revolving door's gate. This gate leads to the courtyard. The gate is accessible during the day and is unlocked. The next challenge is how to go about opening this door. I'll get a prison guard to open it. We have his work permit. We'll trick them into opening it. I see. Once the door opens, you'll knock the guards out and force your way to the courtyard. Very well. Not only will you be charged with attempted escape, but you'll also receive solitary confinement for six months where you cannot even exercise sufficiently. That's fine. I'll go to the courtyard and hand this disc over to someone from The Speedwagon Foundation. That's my only mission in life right now. The guards are coming. Weather Forecast, go find somewhere to hide. I'll go by myself from here. You're severely wounded, and if the guards see your injury, they might lock the gate. Very well. I understand. What is it? Why are you knocking? It's you. "It's you"? What is it, Rangler? What is this noise about? Hold still. I'll open the door. If you are returning to the men's prison, Lang Rangler, how about we stop by the chapel on the way? I'd like to speak to you. It's not a guard! Who is he? He's neither a guard nor a prisoner! What could his attire mean?
05x12 - Torrential Downpour WarningQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:21Who is he? She's Jolyne Cujoh! Not Lang Rangler! Should I assume that he failed, and she's the one with the disc? In a matter of minutes,her ally will come and get the disc at the courtyard. He's the chaplain of this prison. Why is he here now? She knows who I am. No, she would've already att*cked me if she knew I was her enemy. Wait! Please, Father! Please… Don't sound the alarm! I'm not here to cause any trouble! What should I do? It would be easy to b*at him unconscious. That's nothing compared to my father's life. Hitting him is nothing… There is already a problem. You unlocked the door using another inmate's work permit. Where is the owner of this permit, the inmate, Lang Rangler? I know I just met you, and I don't expect you to believe me. But I'm no liar, Father. That inmate att*cked me. It was self-defense. He's passed out in that basket over there. I must report this to the authorities. I understand, Father. But it has to be after I go to the courtyard. I only need two minutes… No, give me just a single minute, Father. I must go to the courtyard. That's all I ask. You want me to turn a blind eye? It's a matter of life and death. My father's life and soul depend on it. A man of God should understand. Are you here by yourself? Is there anyone else with you? No, I'm alone. I lied to a chaplain. But surely, a small lie can be forgiven. And I can't tell him about the disc. Please. I only need a minute. Doing something for others is all an act of expecting a reward. To be kind to others is to expect kindness from others. There is no such thing as unconditional love. Because unconditional love is a reward to go to heaven. You may go. I will pretend I didn't see you here. But only a minute as requested. You have to come back to this gate by then. I have no choice. Someone is hiding behind that container. If she has an ally with her, I can't reveal myself. I can't expose Pale Snake and k*ll Jolyne. The Speedwagon Foundation said I'll know how to hand over the DISC once I arrive once I go to the courtyard. You… Do you have a pass permit? Seems like you don't have one. You are charged with attempted escape. What?What just happened? I never intended to sound the alarm. I made the right move to have a prison guard watch the courtyard. EPISODE : TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR WARNING It was . I befriended a man from Egypt who claimed that he had the power to stop time. This man suddenly said to me… There may be a way to go to heaven. He was young and beautiful, and yet he had the countenance of a man who has lived for centuries. I was  at that time. A student advancing my studies. Hey, don't make a face. I'm not talking about death. The heaven I'm talking about pertains to our spirits. The place our spirits are headed. The power of our mind must surely evolve there. And ultimately where our spirits end up. Surely, you understand what I'm talking about more than anyone. True happiness lies there. Only if you can reach heaven. I know that happiness can't be obtained by having the mightiest body, the most money, or the highest status. True victory belongs to those who have seen heaven. I will do everything to reach that end. Can you be more specific? I've recorded it in a notebook. Come visit Egypt sometime. I will show you then. I will need your help to test my theory. However, before I learned of his methods… his notebook was b*rned to ashes. The one who b*rned it was Jolyne Cujoh's father, Jotaro Kujo. Jotaro read the contents of that notebook. And he sealed its contents forever along with Dio Brando who aimed for heaven. I laid in wait for over two decades to gain access to Jotaro Kujo's memory. The contents of the notebook are within his memory. And I finally obtained his memory along with Star Platinum, which surpassed Dio. And now, Jotaro's body will only decay. Though his daughter has acted quite unpredictably at this prison, my plan is back on schedule. She got sh*t! Jolyne got sh*t! Who? Was it a guard? Or did our enemy learn of our plan and Pale Snake is lurking nearby? Jolyne! The guard will retrieve Star Platinum. My business here is finished. I shall return to the chapel. What… What was this thing? It's a disc. That's right, I was ordered to retrieve this disc. He also ordered me to finish her off completely. But whose order was it? I don't remember… Anyway, I received an order to blow her brains out. It's over. There's nothing more I can do. I cannot help you… You're finished, Jolyne Cujoh! What the hell?! My ability, Weather Forecast, manipulates the weather. This is all I can do. Jolyne, I may not be able to save you, but I can still protect the disc. And if you still have the conviction, you too may be able to make it out. Between  and , in Florida alone, it was reported that more than  cases of fish, frogs, snakes and sheep fell from the sky. The cause is attributed to tornadoes and whirlwinds. And these are poison dart frogs, which live atop the trees of Central and South America. It carries subcutaneous poison so deadly, even aboriginals used them for blowguns. What the hell are these frogs?! These are… These frogs. Aren't they poison dart frogs, known for their toxicity? Once their poison enters the body, it takes mere seconds for the heart and respiratory system to shut down. That's what's splattering along with their body fluid right now. Pale Snake! This ability… Could it be his, who manipulates the weather? Weather Forecast. He should have lost his memory. Was he the one hiding behind the barrel? This is bad! Card key! These frogs are poisonous. What happened to me? Did I get sh*t? Are the wounds deep? The poison, it's seeping through the threads! Someone, open the gate! Please! Calm down. I must keep my composure. What do I do in such a situation? Two, three, five. Calm down. Seven. Count prime numbers and calm down. Prime numbers are solitary numbers that can only be divided by  and itself. They give me strength. Twenty-three. Twenty-eight. No, . Dammit. The frogs are covering my  dollar pants! Weather Forecast is in the laundry room. He's too far. I cannot stop this downpour of frogs. I must escape. Forty-one. That's right. The guard in the courtyard. He's still under my command by the disc. What happened to him? Guard, do you hear me? I order you to come here! Father! Help me! Ask God to save me, please! Forty-three. Forty-seven. Fifty-three. Fifty-nine. What a potent poison. -Tell God to save me! -So you do hear me. Give me your card key! Will I make it out? Hey! Don't take it out right now, idiot! Father! Sixty-seven. Seventy-one. What is going on here? These frogs… I'm saved! Open the gate immediately! Father? What's going on? I don't know! A tornado, most likely. Anyway, hurry it up! Understood. I'll open it now. These frogs, they're… What are you doing? There's an unconscious guard on this side. Hurry, open the door! An unconscious guard? Hold on, Father. I'll get help right away! Wait! Where are you going? Just open this door! That's it! I understand, but what if I need permission? Let me ask my superior. Stay calm. Calm down, Father! I am very calm. The one who's not calm… Seventy-three. Seventy-nine. …is you! You dare abandon me? I'll be back soon, Father! Pale Snake! Give me a disc! I may not be able to control all of them, but I can control one frog. Explode after jumping ten meters. I order you! My eyes! Save me. Father, call for help, please! Father, please! Eighty-three. Eighty-nine. Ninety-seven. I'm right here. You believe that if I leave here and call for help, you could get treated right away. That is what you're thinking, right? Then come towards my voice. Father! Jotaro Kujo's disc, Star Platinum. What should I do with it? I have eliminated Jolyne Cujoh, but I cannot leave her there. Did the gate open? Take me with you… Father? Where are you, Father?! I'm at the end of my rope. I can't guard against the the poison! The disc that I let go… I don't know where it is anymore! The rain stopped. Where is Jolyne Cujoh's corpse? The disc must be close by. That was vexing, but my Snake would never lose to frogs. Search for it. Pale Snake's range is  meters at most. It would pose a serious problem if anyone spots me here, but I'm out of options. The soul of a dead criminal returns to the earth in the form of a frog in want of companions to the afterlife. I've heard of such a legend existing in the East. Doesn't it describe this hellish scene perfectly? And the disc must be somewhere around here. Pale Snake. Search towards the gate from there. The guard might have taken it. It must be within that direction. I found it! I've recovered the disc. Thanks. I was waiting for you to find it. Goddammit. It's grossing me out. They're stuck on my face. Yuck. The frogs splatter poison when they hit the ground and burst. If they aren't crushed, they are harmless. I made a net with the living frogs to lessen the impact of falling frogs. And I waited for you to find the disc. What a futile attempt! I'll k*ll you, you piece of sh*t! He was already here. The envoy from The Speedwagon Foundation, that is. He wasn't even human, and he came exactly on time. He weaved past the rain of frogs and reached this courtyard. Savage Guardian is the name of a pigeon. The trained homing pigeon will carry the disc to the right place. Pale Snake! The g*n the guard dropped is by the gate! sh**t the pigeon down! That damn guard! He used up all the b*ll*ts! Dammit! I won. Don't underestimate me! Nothing has changed. Even with Star Platinum, your father is still a living mummy! He won't even recall his own daughter! Look! A guard is down! Don't step on the frogs! Search the courtyard! Someone might be there! Don't blank out yet. Its Stand User must be close by. I must find Pale Snake's Stand User first. The User has my father's memory disc. Now's my chance to find its User! Hey! Look out the window! Oh my god! It's a miracle! It has to be! But who's going to clean this up? The tide hasn't changed. I took Jotaro's Star Platinum only out of my pledge to avenge Dio, my friend. The memory disc is the one that matters, and it's in my hands. Everything is according to plan. Only Jotaro's memory contains clues to attain heaven. An abnormal situation where the frogs rain only in the prison courtyard. Jolyne's escape attempt was unquestioned in this chaos. And The Speedwagon Foundation obtained Jotaro Kujo's Star Platinum disc. But Jotaro's soul won't return without the Memory disc. Sports Maximum. I wanted to ask you about this bone. I want you to try something using your ability. Is that a human bone? Whose is it? That doesn't concern you. Let's just say it belongs to an old friend of mine. My dear friend, Dio's bone.
05x13 - Kiss of Love and Revenge (1) / Smack of Love and Revenge (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:23GREEN DOLPHIN STREET STATE PRISON Stop right there! What's going on here? What are you doing? ULTRA SECURITY HOUSE UNIT Prisoner FE. Name, Jolyne Cujoh. This is the second time you've caused us trouble. First, you attempted a jailbreak. And now, at the prison mausoleum, a female inmate has been found dead from blunt force head trauma. And yet, you refuse to talk and continue to act defiantly. For some reason, v*olence and death follow you wherever you go. We have no proof that you're the culprit, but you are, without a doubt, the troublesome type. Therefore, from now on, you will be disciplined according to protocol. You are hereby confined for an indefinite amount of time in this Ultra Security House Unit. f*ck! -f*ck! -There's a woman! The newcomer's a woman! I smell a woman! Her smell is seeping out under the door! What the hell? Yes! I got sh*t on her face! My own sh*t, on a woman's face! I want to bash her up too! One thing that must not happen here is the exhaustion of my mental strength. The unnecessary stress and the physical toll it takes. There is something I must accomplish in this Ultra Security House Unit! I must succeed, no matter what. And for that, I must not waste any energy. No. I will grow even stronger! It may be possible to attain heaven.  YEARS AGO Hey, don't look so glum. I'm not talking about death. The heaven I'm talking about has to do with the soul. The place our soul travels to. The power of our soul must surely evolve there. I'm talking about the final form of our souls. Surely, you, out of anyone else are able to comprehend. True happiness lies there. But this is contingent upon attaining heaven. I know happiness is not attained by obtaining the mightiest body, having lots of money, or having dominion over others. True victory belongs to those who have seen heaven. I will do everything… …to reach that end. Let's say I place this sticker on this pen. EPISODE : SMACK OF LOVE AND REVENGE () It then creates a copy of the pen. This is my ability. I call it Smack. Peel the sticker off, and… the pen fuses back together with force, leaving a fissure. It is now easier to destroy. I take this ability as my sign from God. He'll remember in no time that this seal of kiss is my license for revenge. Good morning, Father. May I have one of these flowers? I've grown a fondness for them recently. Of course, feel free to take it. Sports Maximum. F.F., she's cutting in front of you. Hey, I said she cut in line. I know. For some reason, I feel like the others don't accept me here. It's like they're looking down on me. Don't cut, dumbass! Tell her off. I disagree with you. It's not good to force something. You have to change yourself before seeking approval from others. Isn't that right? So, I decided to do the exact opposite of what I usually do. What's the opposite of coffee? Tea? That's right. Atroe's body, which I took over, is craving coffee. So I go with tea instead. On purpose. Does that make sense? Instead of bread, I eat rice. Use my non-dominant left hand instead of my right hand to eat. I'm trying to change myself by doing the exact opposite. Listen, F.F. The wound where I got sh*t… It hurts like hell. I told you. I can only fill the holes with plankton. The rest is up to your body's ability to heal. -Got that? -Damn. Jolyne, what's the opposite of pork? Maybe chicken, or even beef. The opposite of pork is salmon. Pigs lie around in mud all day. Salmons swim against the current to go upstream. I love that. They're cutting again. Scram, bitch! Come on, tell them off! Like I said, I'm trying the exact opposite. Like dragging people into the line. Come along now, right here. What's the matter with you? I won't let you cut in front of me. Don't touch me, bitch. Go to the back, dumbass! What did you call me, bitch? -The hell? -Look at that. It's so much easier to grab food now. Easy as pie. By the way, where's Ermes? I haven't seen her for a few days. Haven't you heard? She's following a man? Is Ermes really doing that? Yeah. Every morning for a while now. Even when you got sh*t, Jolyne. I haven't seen Jolyne. Something's going on in the courtyard. Looks bad. Hey, Ermes! Leave her be. The inmate Ermes is tailing? Yes. You know all the rumors around here. That's correct. I'm honored you came to me, Jolyne. Oh, you don't expect me to tell you for free, right? An information fee. I'll give you a friend's discount. Found it. "The body of a female thought to have been caught in the crossfire of g*ng v*olence was found by the river before dawn." Florida's local papers. It's dated six years ago. It's exactly as Gwess said. Gloria Costello. So she is Ermes's older sister. THE NEXT DAY Over the last few days, I've waited for the right time  as I watched you, carefully and closely. I don't know what caused you to change your heart, but I watched you sweeping the old prison's graveyard. You also left flowers at a grave. Were they for your fellow g*ng members who were ex*cuted in the electric chair? I also watched you making taxidermy birds and alligators in the prison's workshop. Now, why would a grunt like you take up a sudden interest in such a hobby? Well, none of that matters. But there's one thing I must know. Jolyne, F.F. You seem well, Ermes. Here you go. Your share of breakfast. Ermes, about that man you are following… Following? I don't know what you mean. Don't play stupid. His name is Sports Maximum. He is a notorious gangster in the outside world. But now, he is incarcerated in the male wing here. Is that so? Not that it concerns me. Ermes. You were sent here at Green Dolphin for armed robbery. Did you do that just to become a convict at this facility? For you to exact revenge on Sports Maximum for your sister's death. Jolyne. You don't pry into other people's business in prison. Really? Well, I'm doing opposites today. I don't need you to butt in. Go back to the female wing. Ermes is right, Jolyne. You have your own mission to worry about. I know. Just a little longer, Gloria. I'll avenge you with my own hands. Ermes. Think of me as your mother from now on. From that day on, Gloria… you always put the family first. Ermes. You can help at the store sometimes, you know. I want you to inherit your father's restaurant with me. The hell should I care. I'm getting out of here. I want to get a cross-country scholarship and go to college. Don't act all high and mighty and tell me what to do. Ermes! Don't leave! Help me… Fetch me that thick stick with your mouth. Not like a dog, but as a baby would do it. I'm not interested in seeing what lies in the dark. I wouldn't report it to the authorities either. The darkness will handle those who live by it. That's the only way to keep a restaurant open in that city. But that night… Gloria had no choice but to put herself in danger and call the police. She did it to protect me. But even then… Defendant Sports Maximum, you are hereby sentenced to five years in prison for tax evasion and as*ault. Five years? Only five years? We can't corner him with a weak witness. This is the best we can do. He had her k*lled! He destroyed all evidence of that. Bullshit. -Wait. Wait, dammit! -Stay put! f*cking bastard! So you do remember her. That's right. You must not forget Gloria. Gloria! I've been waiting for this chance. I've been waiting for you to be alone so no one can hear your screams. That's what I've been wanting to know. The things you made Gloria suffer through. Sports Maximum. I'll make you remember them! STAND NAME: SMACK STAND MASTER: ERMES COSTELLO The hell is this? What are you doing to me, bitch? Your sentence ends in about a year. Once you're free, you'll have bodyguards. But you are defenseless in here! Yes. It's a perfect fit for you. It's true that prison pipes are not big enough to fit a human being. But that means it fits you perfectly as a coffin. Is that the sound of you falling down? Hey, help me out. Who the hell are you? Let me out, now! -You still don't understand who I am? -What? Take the last few moments of your life to think it through. You left Gloria's body in the gutter. And her suffering drove my father ill. I… lost everything. Beg them for forgiveness in hell, Sports Maximum! If you can with that mouth full of wastewater, that is! I placed a second sticker on the pipe. It'll be a lid for this coffin. It's completely closed now. Now, scream all you want. -You bitch! -Go on, call for help. Only cockroaches and rats will hear you. You belong in the gutter, bastard. Now try to scream, Sports Maximum! Those who rise from the darkness, Limp Viscuit… Come forth and join me… We will share joy in the darkness, Limp Viscuit… Something's there. It's coming towards me. This att*ck! It can't be! Sports Maximum can't be… f*ck, my finger. He's using a Stand ability. I don't understand why I can't see it, but I definitely felt its form. It was bird-shaped! Sticker… Did I win? Did I crush it? I couldn't have known that he gained a Stand ability. How's that? Sports Maximum, you've gone quiet. Did you get crushed inside that pipe? Or did the filthy water fill you up from your mouth to your assh*le, drowning you to death? What is it now? Is Sports Maximum still alive? He must still be alive in that pipe, hence this strange unseen power. It's bigger than the last one. It's fast! This power… Could it be the stuffed alligator from the workshop? Earlier, that was… the bird's corpse moving around. The invisible corpses have gained the power to move. They're the ones attacking me! That bastard. He's trying to bust the pipe and break free! Ermes. Why are you up there? Ermes. Jolyne is worried about you-- Jolyne, F.F, don't come any closer! -F.F! -There's an enemy. There's an alligator. Invisible, dead beasts are crawling around! Damn, it got my leg. Ermes, just what is happening here? -Is this a Stand att*ck? -That's right. It's that bastard, Sports Maximum. He gained a Stand ability without me knowing… Run! It's charging towards you! It's already on the move! Stone Ocean!

He must have gotten a disc from Pale Snake. This must mean… I see now. Jolyne, take F.F. and get out of here. This is my problem. You stay out of it. No, Ermes. This isn't just your problem anymore. Sports Maximum must be after something. Most likely, it's related to my father's stolen memory. He is trying to find something within these prison walls. And we can learn what he's plotting by reading the disc inside Sports Maximum's head. Jolyne, focus on escaping this corridor for now. He has got to be close to drowning in that pipe. If we can hold out until then, his ability will disappear. -Something's off. -What? Where is it? The invisible stuffed alligator. If it moves, the threads should vibrate and show me its location. It's on the wall! The hell? sh*t, an invisible corpse has no concept of up and down. It can travel on the floor or the walls! Stop! I'm the one you want, bastard! You're wrong, Ermes. He's no longer just an enemy of you two. This bastard bit off my left leg. Where is my leg now? In its stomach? So this assh*le is my enemy too. Stay back, F.F. We don't know where it is. It'll take a bite out of you! Stop, F.F. You're right. It'll bite me. That's all these corpses can do. But it's fine. I got my hand inside its mouth. We did it. I felt it going down. Isn't this a part of your mauled shoulder? Dammit, it may not be big enough to patch up. He chomped your shoulder to pieces. Here, F.F. Oh, thanks. -Ermes, come closer. -Yeah? Ermes, am I correct that we were att*cked by an alligator-like ghost? Sports Maximum controls these ghosts. No, I don't think that's right. It was way too vicious. It wasn't a ghost, but an invisible corpse. What? A living dead that hunts for blood by instinct. Sports Maximum's ability can create invisible zombies. The pipe! What is it now, Ermes? What happened to Sports Maximum? Did he drown to death? I can't tell. It's too dark for me to see. He may be lodged deeper in the pipe. Or, maybe he… These handprints… f*ck… My throat is coated with shitty water. I want to rinse my mouth, dammit. What was I about to do? Where was I trying to go? Oh, I remember it now. The chapel… I'm headed to the chapel. My mission… is to find that piece of bone. If you fail, surely you understand that the ability I bestowed will no longer be yours. I know it. My ability, Limp Viscuit, can find that bone. The bone Pale Snake ordered me to find. I can find it. Dammit. I sure could use a break before I start. Like a good scrubbing and something to drink. Something refreshing. That woman there… Perfect timing. She's a bitch type… What was her name? I can't recall it. I'll just call her a bitch. Damn. Won't even greet me though I'm bribing him. Hey, how's it going? Are you on duty? I could use a drink. You want to go to the cafe with me? Afterward, we can have a little fun in a corner in some room. We can rub each other's bodies all over. assh*le, how dare you touch me? You touched me. You better pay up first! What are you talking about? Little sh*t. How dare he touch you when he hasn't even paid? What the… Dammit. Where did Sports Maximum go off to? He must have escaped that pipe while we were dealing with the alligator. Or… Maybe he has already turned into an invisible corpse. That was just a little kick. Stop fooling around! Fooling around? He looks down on you once and it's over for you, bitch. Do whatever it takes to make him pay up. Lend me a hand, and let's find his cash. Are you listening? Come on, help me. He's got something on his sleeves. What's this? Oh, so you will pay me? Why didn't you say that first? That's what I just said. Listen closely, idiot. What else can he be hiding? What about here inside his mouth? Hold on, you want to do it right now, right here? I don't get it. What is it that you want to do? Come on, stop fooling around. I don't do that kinky stuff. I'll be taking this. You had something nice, after all. What the hell is this? This isn't a drug. It's seeping out of my skin. This smell… It's sewage! It's the stench of sewage! My body… The filthy water seeping out of my body reeks of… f*ck! No, I can't already be… The hell? It's flowing from midair. The f*ck's going on? I didn't want anything to drink in the first place. I wanted to devour something! I wanted to devour and satisfy this craving! Yes, the brains! I remember it now. I drowned to death in that pipe. sh*t! She did this to me! That younger sister of Gloria Costello! That bitch, how dare she do this to me? How dare she! I thirst! Ermes, look over there. Oh, my. Be careful. He's out of the pipe just as I thought. How did he do this to her? Did he bite her to death? Are human teeth capable of such a vicious att*ck? Can they destroy a human body like this? He's no longer human, neither in intelligence nor morals. But Pale Snake's disc is with this man, without a doubt. I'll do whatever it takes to get that disc. Jolyne, you wait outside. Damn, he slipped out. Don't leave my side, Ermes. We're trapped in! He is capable of thinking just like a human! Stay away from the wall! We already know that he's not confined to the floor! We'll track his location three-dimensionally! There you are! You chose to hang from the ceiling. Sounds like I crushed some bones. Grabbing with his broken wrist? Right, he's already a corpse. Stone Ocean! He's caught! No. Jolyne! That's not Sports Maximum! He's using the dead woman's body as a decoy! Jolyne! STAND NAME: LIMP VISCUIT STAND MASTER: SPORTS MAXIMUM Jolyne! Where? Where the hell are you, fucker? Jolyne. Don't move anymore, Jolyne. He's not your enemy. This is between me and Sports Maximum. Like I said, Ermes. This goes beyond your personal desire for revenge. No, not even beyond. We are already out of time and energy to even plan. Look over there. -He can't be… -He's had us… cornered the entire time. He has already revived them. The invisible undead. Who knows how many are lurking and where. We're surrounded, Ermes. Let's turn back for now. Staying alive is our priority. We must open that door so that we can escape. I'll extend the thread as much as possible to get F.F. We'll retreat for now. Retrieving the disc and getting your revenge can wait. Ermes! Revenge… That's what's important here, Jolyne. Revenge matters most even to Sports Maximum, who is lurking somewhere in this room. He wants to get revenge for being drowned to death. He must be overcome by vengeance right now. He wants to maul me to death and fill his mouth with blood. -What are you-- -Sports Maximum will make sure -that he's the one who kills me. -Ermes. Listen, Jolyne. Some people will say getting even won't bring my sister back. As if they know what I went through. And others tell me forgiveness is important. Gloria! Bullshit. Forcing myself to forget how it feels to have family thrown in the gutter and live on? I refuse to live like that, and I've braced myself for this moment. Revenge is the way to settle the score with my fate. No, Ermes. Fighting him to the death? Stop. Step back, Ermes. I'm reaching F.F. at this very moment. Five, no, seven of the undead are severing my threads and closing in on us! Don't do this, Ermes! Ermes! Which direction would he strike from? My… consciousness… Ermes… She copied her head with her sticker! The seal of kiss… is my license for revenge! I found you, Sports Maximum! I knew you'd try as much. Just like when you trapped me in that pipe, I knew you'd use that sticker to copy an object. Your ability won't work against me anymore. After all, I am… already dead. sh*t, it didn't work. Where the hell is he? You can't hear my voice, can you? But I'll say it anyway. It's your sister's fault for witnessing what she shouldn't have. Er… mes… Damn! Missed again! Because of your sister, I fell into your hands, and look at me now. I will never get over this feeling. Not this one. Nor this one. Listen up. Even if I eat your brains and stuff the sh*t in your guts into your emptied skull, I will never get over what you did to me. It's over! Now, I will finish you off! Ermes was waiting for this exact moment! The moment he removes the sticker so he can maul her head! Remove the sticker, and the copy fuses back to the original. Even if Sports Maximum had swallowed the duplicate earlier! I know exactly where you are now! Aim slightly above. The midsagittal plane of your face! She got him! Listen. This kick is for Gloria. Sounds like the bones on your face broke just now. Think of it as Gloria smashing your face. And this… is also for Gloria! Make mincemeat out of this bitch! You plan on hiding again. Well, you won't be able to. A sticker split your head in two. Remove this sticker, and it returns to the original. The next hit is also for Gloria. And the one after that too. And so is the next one! The next one too. They are all for Gloria! This one, and this one too! Take this! And this! This, this, and this! This, this, this, and this! They're all for Gloria! I don't know why, but tears started rolling down. I just want… to cry next to you. But I may not have that kind of time. F.F.! Where are you? Come heal her! Hurry! Open this door. Hurry! SPORTS MAXIMUM STAND NAME: LIMP VISCUIT - ANNIHILATED Emergency alarm, Commons Area A, Mausoleum. Stop right there! What's going on here? Don't move! Prisoner FE. Name, Jolyne Cujoh! After reading that disc, I now understand. I know what I must do in here now.
05x15 - Ultra Security House UnitQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:26Listen closely now, Sports Maximum. Just as land comprises % of the planet and water comprises %, a certain number of souls are able to inhabit this planet. The more that humans populate this earth, proportionately, fewer of the other organisms can inhabit it. The total number of souls constantly remains fixed. Now, let's suppose that there's a way for one human to possess dozens, no, hundreds of thousands of souls. What will this human see? What does the future hold for such a human? I couldn't even begin to guess. It's an interesting thought, though. So, what is it that you want me to do? Sports Maximum. I wanted to ask you about this bone. There's something I want you to try doing to it. Try to revive this bone. Is that a human bone? Whose is it? That doesn't concern you. Let's just say it belongs to an old friend of mine. You're telling me to revive it, but that's just a tiny piece. Or do you mean to tell me that the entire skeleton is somewhere else? Can a single bone even be revived? Dio… This is his last remaining bone. The rest of him is dust. They no longer exist in this world. But you must try, Sports Maximum. If you fail, surely you understand that the ability I bestowed will no longer be yours. I get that. But I already tried. It's done already. What's happening? Where is the bone? Where did it go? Where is Dio's bone? What did you do to it? Where is his bone? Now tell me! The hell should I know? That's not a normal bone, now, is it? That bone is beyond my ability's control. The bone is moving around by itself. But I can sense it. I sense it moving around close by. Search for it! Get going, now! Hold it, Sports Maximum. This proves his theory. There definitely is a way to get to heaven. Do not chase the bone. Leave it be. Let his bone wander about freely. I shall merely observe its movements. Then, I will combine it with Jotaro Kujo's memory. I will learn the truth! I feel the bone's presence from the Ultra Security House Unit. Someone may have picked it up. That was Sports Maximum's memory Ermes retrieved by coincidence. Of course, Jolyne already watched it. Then Jolyne got punished on purpose so that she gets confined at the Disciplinary Wing to find the bone! Yes. But it's too reckless. Pale Snake must be aware that we read Sports Maximum's memory. Now, he will do everything within his power to eliminate Jolyne. Jolyne will not last in that wing by herself. I am able to exist like this thanks to Jolyne. But I don't know what I can do. I want your help. I can't. Even Weather Forecast, who is recuperating in the infirmary, cannot reach that part of the facility. I wish I could help, but… The Maximum Security Disciplinary Wing, or Ultra Security House Unit, is southeast of the male wing. To reach it, you must first leave the premises on a transport car. There are no secret passages there either. I've never even been there. So I don't know how I can keep Jolyne safe. I'm not asking you to keep her safe. I only want you to sneak me inside the Ultra Security House Unit. Hey, is there anything you can do for us? You can't expect him to help. Anastasia wouldn't cooperate. But isn't he a Stand User? Were you born with your ability? Like I said, don't count on Anastasia. He will not cooperate with anyone, no matter the reason. Why is that? It's because… I'm willing to do anything. If you take me to the Ultra Security House Unit, -I'll do anything to repay you-- -Stop, F.F. He just isn't the type of person who helps others out. What I'm trying to say is, well… Have you heard of Anastasia, his name? He's a m*rder*r. Anastasia's full name is Narciso Anastasia. Ever since he was a child, for some inexplicable reason, he's had a peculiar habit. No, not really a habit, but rather, a syndrome. A syndrome where he has the urge to disassemble everything. He just must disassemble what he sees. When he was ten, he disassembled his neighbor's Porsche and was institutionalized for six months. One time, he disassembled a high-voltage telephone pole. And when he was , he went over to his then girlfriend's apartment. She was in bed with another man. Anastasia disassembled their bodies on the spot so they can never be together again. The psychiatric analysis conducted after his arrest surprisingly came back normal. That's how he ended up in the Aquarium. Without Weather Forecast keeping him under control, who knows what he's capable of? That's Anastasia. So please, give up on him. But I can't reach Jolyne by myself. I need backup. At the least, I can't do it without his help. But how strange. This feeling… If he refuses,  I'll try to coerce him into it with my ability. But… I can't visualize my first sh*t successfully hitting him. I don't even know where to aim for. If I'm not willing to k*ll him, he won't listen to me. That's the feeling I get from him, but still, I must try. That's the reason why I came. All right. Okay. I can go defend her. Jolyne Cujoh, that is. -What? -I will cooperate. And if she wants to find that bone or something, I will help with that too. Now, let's hurry. She may be under att*ck as we speak. Hold on, Anastasia! What are you plotting? Plotting? I just told you. I will protect her with all my might. But… I've taken a liking to her, and everything about her the moment I laid my eyes on her. She willingly went to the Disciplinary Wing to save her father. Her conviction charms me even more. If I successfully protect her to the end, then I will marry her. This is my condition. Got that? F.F., was it? You said you are willing to do anything. Then, give us your blessing. That's what a wedding needs. What the… Do what now? He said he'll do what with Jolyne just now? Diver Drive! The hell's going on? What was that crash? The att*ck was delayed, and it came out of the wall. That's Anastasia's Stand, Diver Drive's ability. Give us your blessing. STAND NAME: SURVIVOR STAND MASTER: GUCCIO Hey, out of curiosity, Dio. Out of all the Stands you've seen, which one was the weakest? It can be one you encountered while traveling around the world, or one that was created. Which one, I wonder. What is considered suitable is different from person to person. A king has his strengths… and a cook has his own too. That's what it means to live. The same goes for Stands. The concept of being strong or weak does not apply. I phrased it badly. Children argue for fun about things like "Which one is stronger, Stallone and Van Damme?" Let's talk on that level. A Stand I named Survivor is the weakest. However, Survivor is a handful. Survivor? Sounds powerful. It was . In France's Lorraine region, a group of six went hiking, went missing, and then were found dead. The investigation team stated that the six broke out into a fight in the mountains. They fought each other to death. Men and women alike applied such intense force to their muscles that their own bones broke. A tooth that broke and flew off after a punch had split a rock and wedged itself there. That's how brutal the struggle was. Even the victor was unable to descend the mountain due to his injuries. Here is what I learned later. The six had stayed in a lodge the night before they d*ed. They had quarreled with the lodge owner. One of the women ridiculed the lodge owner's body odor, saying he stunk. And this lodge owner was a Stand User. Precisely. But what did this lodge owner do to them? And why did the six fight to their deaths? The answer is that he did nothing. He did nothing to them, but there was a slight anger that surged in his mind. And that slight anger converted into a small electric potential in his brain, traveled down his nervous system, and flowed out into the ground. That's the Stand, Survivor. The electric current followed the ground's surface all the way to the six hikers. The ground and the hikers' shoes had to be wet to let the electricity travel easily. The electric potential sending signals to the nervous system is very small, at mV. This Stand dwells in that slight pulse of energy. Survivor's att*ck is mostly unnoticed, and it doesn't cause any harm. It does not injure humans, nor can it manipulate them. It cannot inflict pain or put someone to sleep. The Stand does none of these things. It simply awakens its victim's anger. It stimulates the limbic system of the human brain ever so slightly, awakening its fighting spirit. Just because one woman ridiculed the lodge owner's body odor, all six were made to fight to their deaths. Earlier, you said it's a handful. A useless Stand is what it is. It can't tell a friend from foe. If subordinates started fighting each other, their organization would collapse. Could you give me that ability? If you don't plan on using it, I'll take just the Stand. Extract the ability only and store it in a disc, you say? That may be a good idea. To each their own. It may prove useful one of these days. I guess these mushrooms are edible. They're pretty good. It's shower time. Get up, FE! It's bright! Hell yeah! I got her! She hid! She hid like a dirty cockroach! I win this cell. The total sum is  dollars for my wins! Sorry! Damn. But all I got on me is  dollars. Come on, let's shake on it. If that's all you got, I guess. In any case, what I must do here is to use this thread to find the bone. What is that bone doing here? I don't know the answer yet, but for some reason, it's somewhere inside this Disciplinary Wing. Could it be in someone's possession? If I can obtain the bone first, Pale Snake will come after me. And with him, my father's stolen memory disc in his hand! Hey dumbass! Who told you to stand? By the way, how do you think the Marlins will play tonight? Their chances of winning are slim. The pitcher broke up with that reporter girl. He won't throw any strikes. You want to bet those  dollars on it? I'm in. Aren't you short on money, though? I'm telling you, his throws will be bad. No, that pitcher is good. You're such easy prey. Can't wait for tonight's game. Oh, sorry. This valve doesn't close very easily. Be more careful. I have to go back to the main prison to change. Hey, why did you hit me? I said I'm sorry. It's not like I got you wet on purpose. Oh, did I hit you just now? The hell is wrong with you? I didn't smack you that hard. You want some? You didn't need to punch me hard, bastard. -You jerk! -assh*le! Why you little… All right, that's enough. I said enough. I said stop. I'll apologize. I'm sorry. I'll lend you my uniform if you don't have a spare. That settles it, right? Let's be done. What got into you? Calm down. Are you in a bad mood today? We're friends… right? That hurts! You swing hard, fucker! I'll take you on! What has gotten into them? It can't be… I'm getting excited. His physique… I can see where his body's strengths are! His superbly developed muscles! Beautiful… I can sense his strongest muscle structures! How wonderful it is to fight! What the… What's happening to their bodies? What are those things that seem to shine? Here I come. I'll show you who is stronger! I am the strongest! Is this an enemy's att*ck? Is that guard my foe? No, the enemy hasn't shown up yet. But this is a Stand ability! This freakish feel… It must be a Stand att*ck! "Do not cast what is holy to the dogs; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces." Matthew :. Sports Maximum has gone missing. I can't fathom how they learned of it, but I must conclude that they read his memory. The number of Stand Users I sent to the Disciplinary Wing… Four! If Jolyne Cujoh entered the Disciplinary Wing in search of Dio's bone… I cannot let her live a moment longer. I will use all my strength to eliminate her! It doesn't really matter what happens inside the Disciplinary Wing. Those four will undoubtedly fight on until Jotaro's daughter is eliminated! He sent everything he's got. I can see where your strengths are! Bastards! I can see the strongest parts of each fighter's body from here! It's Fight Club time! Let's brawl!

Survivor's att*ck is mostly unnoticed, and it doesn't cause any harm. It simply awakens its victim's anger. EPISODE : THE SECRET OF GUARD WESTWOOD Bastards! I can see the strongest parts of each fighter's body from here! It's Fight Club time! Let's brawl! I've always found you irritating, f*ckers! The enemy User must be among them. One of them manipulated the guards into fighting. The bone lurking somewhere within this Ultra Security House Unit… I'll do anything it takes to make it mine! I won't let anyone stand in my way. If anyone dares, I will k*ll-- Hold on… k*ll? Did I really think that just now? This burning feeling awakening within me… Is this my fighting spirit? It urges me to conquer all no matter who I'm up against or what happens to me. Why do I feel so aggressive? This prison guard… Now, he wants to do to me what he did to the other guard. But that's fine. He's no match for my Stone Ocean. Stone Ocean! I can see it, FE. I can see your strongest point. It's the thread-like thing coming out of your muscles. It's beautiful. So that's your strongest power. His movements just now… Though his fight with the other guard was uncanny and brutal, it was still just a brawl. But now, his movements are beyond what humans can do! I have to defeat him with all my power as fast as I can! The guard's muscles… They are shining beautifully. Also, the sequence of his movements just now… How is a human capable of ignoring fear and pain to exert that much force when attacking and jumping? But if the beautiful lights emanating from his muscles indicate his strongest parts, then that leg of his right now… That's the leg I att*cked. My att*ck was effective! I can feel it. I can tell that my att*ck did some deep damage to his leg! Bastard. Who said you can walk in front of me? You're pissing me off! The others have started fighting too. Take this! Damn prison guard! I must incapacitate him as quickly as I can and focus on finding the bone! Good thing you didn't wring your own neck with that swing of yours. Now, just stay there! What the hell just happened? How did he att*ck me? This prison guard! What did you do just now? This is… So he is also a Stand User. There's more than one User in this Disciplinary Wing. He already had a Stand on a disc! But what did he do, and how? I left him no chance to counter me. And I didn't see his Stand, so how did he att*ck me? It's deep. f*ck, it's deep. He can't leave a wound this deep with a stashed razor blade or a Kn*fe. Just what did he do to me? If he has a power-type Stand, then I should be able to see it! FE. You use threads to att*ck. I see threads and a bundle of them in your body. Your strongest power comes from using this ability. That's what makes you strong. How beautiful. I can see your shine. When did you become a Stand User? Yesterday? Or a moment ago? I saw it! I saw his Stand! His Stand took form! A Stand User… So this bastard is the assassin sent to eliminate me. Strings do not require power to defend. A punch's straight trajectory can easily be changed by throwing it off by just a little. Right into my trap. Now that you've used both of your arms, I can restrict all your movements. In other words… you'll get covered with my jacket. Stone Ocean! I won't let you get back up. Wha… what? It's happening again! What does his Stand do? No, I can't see it! What did it do? I have you now! You're just a piece of sh*t. You've made a fool out of me. How dare you. Prisoners are the scum of society. Nothing infuriates me more than scum like you treating me like sh*t. I spent every day on duty irritated like this. How dare you look down on me. I'll make you pay. I'm not holding back anymore! I'll release my anger now. I won't hold anything back. I'll make sure you pay. I am the strongest! I'm going crazy, and you're going to get it! What's that on the ceiling window? No, so his Stand is… This isn't good! At this rate, I'll be… I have to get away! His Stand's att*ck is coming towards me! I got you now. I've completely locked you in. Did you forget that I'm a prison guard? I detain prisoners almost every day at my job. Your right hand may seem to be free, but this headlock does more than choke. I'm also twisting the joint on your left shoulder so that your right arm goes dead and doesn't rise. Your right hand won't reach my face. This headlock has one weakness, which I know very well. Your right hand is free to grab my balls. Of course, I wouldn't mind that if the situation were different. But I can even block that too! It's coming! If I don't do something, his Stand's true form will… That ceiling! The ceiling window's hard glass… Those cracks! I have to break free! Stone Ocean! I tore his eardrum! His grip loosened! The universe is full of countless space rocks and debris. Many of such rocks are drawn in by the gravitational pull of the earth. While the majority disintegrate before reaching the surface, what if the meteorites could retain optimal angle and speed while entering the atmosphere? STAND NAME: STARLIGHT WAVES STAND MASTER: VIVIANO WESTWOOD Oh, so you're coming too. I can do this by myself. I make and call the sh*ts around here. Yes, I asked for your help, but let's make that clear. Also, if Pale Snake really is determined to eliminate Jolyne, he must have sent two assassins, no, even more than that. There must be at least three Stand Users after Jolyne's life. You and I will get rid of them, then meet back here. Got that? Fine. I plan to be back before that guard wakes up. Also, we already agreed that I'll marry Jolyne. Don't forget that. Yeah, so about that… What the hell do you mean? I really don't get you. Meteorites! His att*cks are the meteorites that are drawn to this prison guard! That's what was smashing into me. His Stand attracts meteorites from space. But they always burn away before they can hit him. And another one will fall. He'll attract another one! Before that happens… I got you! This time, I won't let go! I'll be the victor, shining beautifully. I am the strongest! Stone Ocean! I'll strip off your skin from toe to head! Now let me go, you f*cking guard! He loosened his grip! I barely dodged them. I tried to deflect the meteorites toward him, but it's just like the last time. Not a single meteorite will hit him. They disintegrate the moment before they hit him! That prison guard's Stand ability attracts the falling meteorites toward his body like a magnet! But no matter what I try, the meteorites hit only me when I get close to him. How bizarre. Burning rocks are falling toward me from the sky. Are they meteorites? Could this be my strongest power? FE. How many of them have smashed into you? Your wounds look serious. They got both your arms, your left ribs, and your right leg. So that's five times. Or is that six? The next one will be your fatal blow. What a bluff. You are barely able to stand right now. Not even, you are just trying to fool me with that stance. In truth, you can't fight me with those arms anymore. Your arm muscles are pitch-black. The muscles have really lost their shine. Why don't we fool around a bit? Let's see how bad your damage is. What's the matter? Come on, give me a swing. I'm not even blocking. Here, att*ck me. How do you want to punch me? I'll even close my eyes for you. Over there! That little thing he's got. That's the bone Pale Snake is after! That's the bone! It's right over there! You can't even fight anymore! You are using the wall to block the meteorites. I knew you'd try that! Meteorites were already crashing towards me from the other side of the wall! I won! I knew it, you are so damaged that you can't even block my blows! One stared at the wall While the other looked up at the stars On the other side of the bars Which am I? And now, one more hit! The bone is right over there. I will do anything to get close to Pale Snake. I'll even drink sewage water. I'll even become the strongest! I win! There's no way for you to escape the meteorite now! Of course, I want to look up at the stars. I want to keep looking at them until I see Dad again. Good grief. Here comes your final blow! You're done for! I can't dodge this final blow. I can't block it with Stone Ocean anymore. I am superior! But… I did manage to slip off your right shoe. She even put a brick in my boot! She took the hit, but the damage was halved! She changed its course! The meteorite will disintegrate. It's impossible to hit you with it. I'm strictly speaking about the meteorite, that is. My boot! Seriously, good grief. You bitch! Stone Ocean! What is up with this bitch? She really doesn't give up. She doesn't give up at all. Dammit. Yes, if the meteorite collides into something else first, then she can hit me with it. How terrible. How dare she do such a terrible thing against me. This woman… I choose to look up at the stars. Match over!
05x17 - Enter the Dragon's Dream / Enter the Drake's DreamQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:28My dear friend, Dio's bone. What's happening? Where is the bone? Where is his bone? Now tell me! I feel the bone's presence from the Ultra Security House Unit. Then Jolyne got punished on purpose so that she gets confined at the Disciplinary Wing to find the bone! Yes. But it's too reckless. If I can obtain the bone first, Pale Snake will come after me. And with him, my father's stolen memory disc in his hand! That small man… I must find him. He has the bone! Is he hiding somewhere? What if someone gets that small man before I do? I must obtain the bone before I lose it again. What happened here? They are already done fighting. And everyone in the Disciplinary Wing is abnormally bloated. It's a Stand. How many other Stand Users were sent here? Are they the ones who did this? Just what exactly did they do? No, one User only has one Stand. These prisoners were defeated by just one of these two guys. How many other Stand Users were sent to this Disciplinary Wing? At the least, there is one more User who manipulates others into fighting by stimulating their minds. Can you stand with that injury of yours? That thread Stand of yours was most fascinating. Especially since it's impossible to predict its next move. Even more intriguing, though, is your mental strength. Despite the damage to your body, I can sense the growth you've had since the last battle. When Pale Snake said he would send four Stand Users, including myself, I questioned his judgment for sending such an excessive number of us. But now, I understand him a little better. Especially since he wishes to finish you off completely. I am Kenzou,  years old. The secret to my longevity is eight and a half hours of sleep a day and my daily "urine therapy," with just one cup every morning. The important thing is to keep the habit going. Have you heard of "urine therapy"? If you want a fight, I won't back down. American-style. French-style. Japanese-style. Italian-style, specifically Naples. Those are "f*ck you" gestures from around the globe. I will start by telling you the conclusion. These prisoners drowned to death. I drowned them, so their bodies are bloated like that. And it seems that I won't be facing you just yet. F.F.! sh*t. He knew I was sneaking up on him from the bloated bodies. My preemptive strike failed. Not only that, but that bloated corpse got in the way of my F.F. g*n. Close call. F.F., how did you get in here? I made it in the nick of time. Looks like you're in some deep sh*t. I'll fill up your wounds in a second. That man… who was he again? Right, he was at Emporio's hideout with Weather Forecast. Before I heal you, Jolyne, I'll take care of this geezer! Southeast,  degrees,  minutes, and  seconds. Their sweat… It will drip. Will they open their mouth? Do you want to drown? Drown? I don't know what your plans are, but I sure love water. See if it works on me-- The time it takes for humans to drown in water is between five to seven minutes for those who have been trained. That's only if there's air left in the lungs. But let's say all the air is sucked out from both lungs. In this condition, humans drown to death instantly with a mere few drops of water! I directly struck your fourth cervical vertebra by going through your throat. It contains nerves connected to your kidney. The adrenal gland! It produces bodily fluids that lubricate the respiratory system like oil does to an engine. Even a few drops of water will make you feel as if you are being swallowed up in a giant wave! I can't breathe! Right now, I'm in the body of an average human, Atroe. This is bad, this body won't last! F.F.! Do you want to drown too? Jolyne Cujoh! I have you! What are you? Are you really human? Don't stand. Just observe them from here for now. Shouldn't you be assessing what kind of Stand User that geezer is? The problem here is not that he drowned those prisoners, but that he dodged every b*llet. It may seem insignificant, but how did he do that? That's more dangerous, don't you think? What brought you here? Your name is Anastasia, right? I love you. I couldn't wait to be here with you. Say what now? That old man has been incarcerated here for  years now. He's an idiot who drinks his own piss. I thought I hadn't seen him at the male wing for a while, but who would've guessed he was here? Even worse, he now has a Stand. In the autumn of , this geezer k*lled  people, all young men and women. His sentence is for  years. Though he's old now, he was  when he received his sentence. He was the self-proclaimed founder of a cult. His sect was so popular that even Hollywood stars joined it. However, his cult's activities clashed with society,  so the police and the FBI intervened. Cornered, this geezer locked himself and  of his followers in an estate here in Florida. He attempted to burn everyone to death. Kenzou drugged every follower and set the building on fire. All the believers b*rned to death, but the founder survived. Strangely enough, it so happened that a part of the wall collapsed on him, protecting him from the smoke and fire. He was barely alive when he was rescued. There's no doubt he intended to die. What am I trying to say? Who knows. I can't say for myself. Either way, Kenzou alone survived. He cannot leave this prison, but he wasn't put to death, either. These are the facts surrounding this man. I don't know what you are, but I can tell your strongest power. The secrets to your strength, yes. I can clearly sense something else other than blood running through your veins. Is that your Stand? Or are you an entirely different being? Those things do not change your weakness. Your weak points and body structure are the same as any other human, including the blood flowing within you. Do you want to drown again? This time, you will not survive. Southwest,  degrees,  minutes. He made something appear in his hands again. What is that? And what is his weird footwork for? Let's see the direction of your dragon. F.F., it's behind you! Wrong. It's useless, so stop attacking me! STAND NAME: DRAKE'S DREAM STAND MASTER: KENZOU Wrong. It's useless. So stop attacking me. I said, your enemy is the geezer! You don't listen, do you? I don't pick sides. Your att*cks will only pass through me. Face forward! You better watch out. The geezer's coming for you! I have no right to butt in. Mind you, the geezer. The geezer is your enemy. This dragon! Is this dragon's ability allowing Kenzou to dodge my b*ll*ts? And here he comes. This speed… Those don't seem like punches from a -year-old. Now I can enter the dragon. What's going on? What did he do to his own arm? His arm flew behind F.F.'s head! That was close. But they blocked his att*ck in their own weird way. His arm disappeared the moment he touched that dragon Stand. Does it conceal the direction of his next strike? What is that dragon-like thing? Does your arm fly off when you touch that dragon? You still punch like an old geezer, though. Wrong, F.F. I can already see what will happen. But no one else can predict it. Don't say unnecessary things! Stop your yapping. You are supposed to stay neutral! You're keeping it to yourself, that's not fair! Just tell them! You opened your mouth. F.F.! Was that a coincidence just now? That prisoner's glasses flew up and stabbed F.F's face! Unlucky direction. I'm starting to understand it. He's using feng shui. There is a principle called feng shui in East Asia. Kenzou's footsteps pointing to cardinal directions indicate it. As if predetermined, he advances his att*cks from one direction. Furthermore, the Stand in his hands… Kenzou uses that dragon-like Stand to choose his direction of att*ck. Feng shui? What's that? Direction of att*ck? Feng shui. It's a divination method much like tarot card reading and astrology, except it's not fortune-telling. According to Eastern philosophy, there are natural forms of energy such as wind energy and water energy flowing through mountains and valleys. The flow of such energy is used to guide one's life. For example, feng shui is used to determine the luck found in an area, house, and even a room. If the land or house faces an unlucky direction, it is said to affect the wealth, health, and fortune of those who live there. In times of w*r, an enemy castle's feng shui was read to decide which direction to att*ck from in order to make the enemy fall. On the other hand, temples were built at castles' unlucky directions to counteract bad fortune. This provided further protection to strongholds. Not only that, but feng shui's philosophy is even applied to human anatomy. There's such thing as assassination feng shui. You can use feng shui to determine the luckiest direction of att*ck against a human. Then, no matter how the opponent tries to block the advances, it is possible to approach the target without letting them in on the offensive. Thus, making the assassination easy. In other words, the unlucky orientation. Kenzou's Stand must rely on this principle. F.F. must fight against the direction of worst luck. That dragon Stand points to the best direction for a k*lling blow. When that geezer's att*ck overlaps with the dragon's location, F.F.'s fate is sealed. Who would've thought that Kenzou has mastered assassination feng shui during his  years in prison, manifesting it as his Stand ability! Feng shui shows the direction he should take. The same concept applies for defending. F.F. missed every sh*t. That was the reason! It's because feng shui worked in his favor and protected him. Is that right? Undoubtedly. When he has the dragon in his hands, he can read his safest direction. After moving to that area, he then prepares to strike. The dragon points to the orientation best for k*lling. F.F.! It wasn't a coincidence that the glasses hit you! Don't let Kenzou move toward the dragon! I don't really understand it, but you must not let Kenzou touch the dragon! Look at that, Drake's Dream! They figured out my trick because of your blabbering! Shut up, old freak. I'm not your henchman! Feng shui should be open to anyone. But it's true that the old geezer benefits most from me. F.F., this area is your worst luck. Just above your left ear. This area is the worst weak point for you. Your lucky color is yellow, and pictures of goldfish bring you luck. If you have any, that is. F.F., he's behind you! So you'll chop me, will you? I don't even need to position myself in the dragon's orientation. His defensive stance is also an att*ck. Must be derived from tai chi. Your mouth is mine! Another instance where the defensive stance is also an att*ck. You wench! Using the dragon's orientation seems to be the surest path to victory. I made your hand overlap with the dragon! It works the same as if I att*ck. Your own arm will now hurt you! My att*ck overlapped with your orientation of death! Bastard, what did you just do to me? What did you do with my arm just now? I just said it's the orientation for worst luck. That's the power of orientation for you. I can't predict what happens next, and if I were you, I'd try to reduce the damage to a minimum. F.F., get away from there! The meteorites destroyed the supports! The fan will fall on you! Oh, the fan isn't your thr*at. The boomerang is. F.F.!
05x18 - Enter the Foo Fighters / Enter the F.F.QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:29Is there anything you can do for us? All right. Okay. I can go defend her. Jolyne Cujoh, that is. I'll take care of this geezer! Southeast,  degrees,  minutes and  seconds. This time, you will not survive. Face southwest,  degrees,  minutes. F.F., it's behind you! I said, your enemy is the geezer! His arm flew behind F.F's head! Was that a coincidence just now? That prisoner's glasses flew up and stabbed F.F.'s face! Unlucky direction. I'm starting to understand it. He's using feng shui. There is a principle called feng shui in East Asia. Kenzou uses that dragon-like Stand to choose his direction of att*ck. F.F., this area is your worst luck. Just above your left ear. My att*ck overlapped with your orientation of death! F.F.! No… this is seriously bad. Stop. You cannot save them. The direction of our worst luck exists for you and me as well. And once it's decided, no living being can escape it. It was proven to us just now. Their next target will be you. No. I'm not talking about their head getting chopped in half. I'd rather that their head bleed profusely. It's worse that they're barely bleeding at all. All the damage has depleted the water levels in their body. The plankton in their body are starting to die off! I'm glad it's not gushing out. But that was the unluckiest direction, without a doubt. EPISODE : ENTER THE F.F. What? Return to me, dragon! That almost finished you off, geezer! Never… Never again! Never will I set my foot off of the direction of safety! sh*t, he escaped to a safe area. But… I'm starting to understand the orientations, and ways around it! A mirror… I need to make a mirror! If only there was a mirror midair, then I can reflect that dragon on it. I can trick Kenzou into stepping towards a fake direction of safety. Then, I'd have a chance to b*at him down. But first, I must have water. I can make a mirror out of water. I need water to heal from all the damage too, but right now, I need to replenish on water to create a mirror midair! In the past, over , believers followed my teachings and walked in my steps. But ever since I came to this prison, my life has changed. I'm mocked. Everyone mocks me and laughs at me. Even a pedophile who kidnapped children ridiculed me. Forty years… I've suffered this for  years! I was once respected! Forty years ago, I basked in glory! And those days will come again. The feng shui which saved me from the ravaging fire has now taken form as my Stand! I will reign as Founder once again! Though I may fail to break out of here, fervent followers will return to me! After I finish you off, that is! Now, meet your end! Drake's Dream! Reveal to me the direction of the finishing blow! F.F., just beyond the stairs! There's a fire hose! Hey, you. Don't just stand there and explain things. Go help F.F.! You have a Stand, don't you? Fight with F.F. to finish off that geezer! Only if F.F. dies. My terms do not include helping F.F. Our deal only extends to saving you. Besides, F.F. themself said they don't want any help. When they saw your injuries, F.F. directed me to protect you from the enemies in this Disciplinary Wing. Where is it? How do I make water come out? Where is the valve? Don't come here. This area contains your worst luck yet. Guard against it at all costs. Or else, you will be dealt a decisive and fatal blow. You don't have time to drink water! Of their own volition? F.F., what the hell are you doing? The att*ck against you has been decided! What are you thinking? F.F. must have water above anything else. Even in the way of a decided att*ck or the zone of worst luck. They got rid of their arms on purpose so that they could fit into that hose. They did it! They finally have water-- That's your own arm. Here comes the assassination feng shui. Looks like you desperately wanted water, but you will never be at an advantage from now on. My att*ck will only bring you the worst luck. Such is the assassination feng shui, Drake's Dream! That's what it means to have your fate sealed! They couldn't reach water. They didn't even touch it! What happens now? Underneath this Disciplinary Wing is the execution room. The State of Florida permits the death penalty. Two or three prisoners a year are ex*cuted on a ,-volt electric chair. D-damn… I was so close to touching the water. But I did bust the pipe. I need to reach the water upstairs somehow. At this rate, I'll… Plankton like them would perish in an instant. sh*t! This chair, it can't be! What? Don't tell me it's already on! Does that sound mean the electricity is ready to run? Bullshit! I won't let it run! Let's see what kind of an end you'll meet with my att*cks. Anyone can predict the outcome of this situation at this point. Before it turns on, I will get the drops of water dripping from the ceiling! Looks like your place on that chair was already decided by fate. Take this! Behold, you will never obtain water. And that was right on time. You will now meet your end! STAND NAME: F.F. STAND MASTER: F.F. F.F.! The absolute orientation of att*ck and flawless direction of defense. Assassination feng shui. It took  years, but I can now say I have mastered it. The Founder reigns again! With this, I'll go down in history as a Buddha equal to Shakyamuni! You know I'm supposed to stay neutral. I'm in no position to tell you this, geezer. But F.F. finally got the water they wanted. If it weren't for your kick, they wouldn't have had any. You ran a little too much, you -year-old man. You can't help but sweat when they had you running all over the place. And your perspiration became the water they needed. F.F. made a mirror out of your sweat. With enough sweat to fill a third of a cup, they can form a floating mirror. What I'm saying is that you're seeing my reflection. So you are by no means standing in the orientation of safety. It's a draw. The only chance at defeating assassination feng shui is a draw. They have braced themself for this moment. That's right, take this. I'll share this unluckiest fate with you! The direction of safety… F.F.… It's over. On to the next. You wanted to look for the bone, right? We must start thinking ahead. At the least, you won't fall victim to Kenzou's assassination feng shui now. It was indeed a formidable Stand. F.F.! Inconceivable. Jolyne Cujoh, what are you doing? Your body has suffered more damage than you realize! The colony of plankton inside F.F.'s body has already been wiped out by , volts of electricity. You know better than anyone else! B-But the dragon… The dragon is still here! They must have let go of him a moment too early. Or it could be that plankton are more susceptible to electricity than humans. Kenzou is still alive! Wait! You cannot manifest your Stand with that body! Has revenge driven you mad? I won't let him stay alive like this. Stone Ocean! You cannot hit me. I will finish you and reign as the Founder once again! I see it now. So that's the direction of safety. So I see. You were after Kenzou's direction of safety. Once you identified the direction impervious from every att*ck, then F.F., who scattered along with the mirror, should be safe in this spot. The plankton there should've been safe from the , volts. You att*cked him to find this exact spot. F.F. survived. Good grief. How could this be? Jolyne! You think you've won now, do you? You think you have defeated me? Jolyne Cujoh. There is no change in my plans to defeat you. You haven't noticed, now have you? You have already… stepped inside my assassination feng shui's direction! My thread is inside the dragon! The att*ck is absolute! Your worst luck has now been decided! It doesn't matter how I choose to att*ck, because your defeat is already decided! I won! Now, kneel before me! The Founder's reign cannot be altered! What? Hey… I dealt a blow, didn't I, Drake's Dream? Assassination feng shui is absolute. My deadly kick should have defeated Jolyne, isn't that right? Yeah, she couldn't dodge your deadly blow. Then how is Jolyne unscathed, while I'm clinging to this fence? What? Dragon, show me the direction of safety… Come now, dragon, why are you moving away? Tell me the direction of safety! Why won't you come closer? I want to ask that myself. You are the one getting farther away. You let go of that railing, and now you are falling down. Why are you just blabbering? I said, tell me the direction! I told you, you are the one getting farther away. Geezer, look at your own legs. Something is really wrong with it. There's something off about them. You could have gotten att*cked when you kicked Jolyne. Oh, that's… What the hell? That's not her thread Stand! What is that Stand emerging out of Jolyne Cujoh's body? Diver Drive. I submerged it into her body. Though the att*ck on Jolyne was decided, it protected her precisely at the moment of your blow. What the hell? This man who came with F.F., Anastasia. He put his own Stand into my body and destroyed Kenzou's legs in an instant. His bones and muscles were entirely disassembled. They were then rearranged into this spring-like shape. It is now a suspension made of meat and bones. However, Kenzou is not feeling any pain. But I don't feel pain either, thanks to that Stand that manipulated the guards into fighting. But… Even my hips! I need the direction of safety, dragon! I can't reach it! I'm coming your way! Is he really an ally? He's capable of dealing such terrible damage. Just who is this man? That's it. I love that. Yes, I want you to gaze at me more. Look at me with those eyes. The direction of safety is northeast and your lucky color is cerulean blue. But you know… I think you're done for. You sure aged a ton in a fight that lasted a few minutes. KENZOU ( YEARS OLD) STAND NAME: DRAKE'S DREAM BEYOND RECOVERY Are you okay, Jolyne? Yes… The pain is hitting me all of a sudden. But I have to find the bone and the small man who picked it up. Wait just a moment. I can fill your wounds. Hurry. I have to get it back soon. My father's disc.
05x19 - Birth of the 'Green'QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:29He is currently in a sleep state. He wakes up sitting up cross-legged, stays awake for a few hours, then falls asleep for another  hours. It's all understandable. His entire memory is gone, after all. How is he retaining new information since getting resuscitated? It's normal. He has learned about  English words so far. However, he does not comprehend his identity. Even his family… He doesn't show any response, even to his daughter's photos. His brain waves and EKG are within normal parameters. But his muscle mass has decreased. With all his memories gone, he does not feel any reason to live, causing the body to rapidly atrophy. What can we do, Doctor? I cannot say. His only chance of recovery might be retrieving his memory. Doctor, do not touch his head! He got hurt! We must treat him! I'm sorry, Doctor. I forgot to warn you. Did he use his Stand just now? He did. However, that wasn't from his consciousness. It was just his instinctive bodily reflex to defend. "Jo… Lyne." "Jolyne"? No… that's not possible. I've always… I've always cared about you. Something's going on with your cut. It was fixed. I know I just filled it in. It looks like some sort of writing, doesn't it? Should I try to fill it again? Wait. Don't fill this one. I can't explain it, but… I just know it. This is a message from my father. He's had so much to protect even before I was born. He was always away to keep dangers like the one I'm in now away from me and Mom. I felt it, just now.  My body tells me that I understand my father now. EPISODE : BIRTH OF THE "GREEN" -Hey F.F. -What? Can you trip Jolyne down the stairs? Just a little bit will do. Why would I do that? I said, try to trip her. We won't let her get hurt, of course. I want to catch her from falling with my own arms. What? Jolyne doesn't seem like she understood that I saved her. I want to embrace her tightly one more time. Now, get to it. -Trip her. -Why don't you do it? That's sexual harassment. I already told you. I'm going to marry Jolyne. And you promised to cooperate. Or do you not keep your word? Now, go do it. I'm sorry, Jolyne. The small man! He's right here! He was spying on us from above! Look! He has the bone in his hand! This fucker sure moves in a funny way, but he won't get away! Hold it! Do you see his back contorting? You called him a small man. It's true he fit the description earlier. -But something strange is happening… -Sunbathing… Isn't he growing taller? He's as tall as me, no, he's taller than me now. You have nowhere to run. Turn around slowly. The sunlight is nice and warm. Light is good. I said turn around, you little sh*t! Bleh… Bleh. What the f*ck is with him? Light, bleh, warm. We are happy… as we gather around… and it's warm. Bleh. What was that? Did you see that stuff splatter? He could be a Stand User! Keep your distance. It doesn't seem to be a Stand. I don't know what it is, but we mustn't touch him. Where's the bone? The bone he had earlier. Where is it now? What the… The other prisoners have already fallen prey. Those look like plants. They're still growing. What happened to them, and who did this? What is the meaning of this? Should I assume that it's a Stand ability? This bone, along with the power and some sort of will that sprouted these plants… It's as if they are trying to give birth to something. It bloomed the flowers first, then the plants matured. They grew out at the end of the person's life. Now, what to do with this bone that the man dropped… Merely touching this bone or anyone who grabbed it can be dangerous, after all. Don't take another step, Jolyne Cujoh! Stop right there! Show me your face. Turn around. -What? -It's nothing. I want to take a moment to check something. What the hell is wrong with you? Let go of her, assh*le! F.F., you stay silent. The bone transformed the prisoners in the Disciplinary Wing into that state. It can't be an enemy Stand, since that would have targeted us from the start. And if I'm not mistaken, Jolyne, I think I saw your thread touching that bone when it was still in his grasp. The bone! It's rolling away! She's infected! Jolyne! But how? Diver Drive! Yes! Weed them all out from the inside, quick! There's more! Why did you stop? I wouldn't exactly say they're growing out of her or that they need to be rooted out. Rather, her body itself is transforming into plants. Is it safe to pull them out? Jolyne, does it hurt? No. I guess I did touch that bone. Anyway, you should stay away from me now that I'm infected. It might spread to you. These are just plants, nothing more, nothing less. I can't tell what species they are, but its stems are filled with chlorophyll, not blood. Either way, I'll take care of it. I promise. The sunlight! Get in the shade. If you touch sunlight or move toward the light, the plants will grow rapidly. Step farther into the shade, and the plants recede. Damn, what does it want? I can't say, but I still need to get that bone. And just how will you do that? If you hold the bone, you'll turn into a plant, Jolyne! I will pick it up. I'm already becoming a plant. Don't go where the sunlight touches, Jolyne! The bone… Where is it? Where can it be? I thought I saw it rolling towards this flower. A star shape? What is this bruise-like mark? It's see-through. There's something else underneath. A child… It's a green child! STAND NAME: YA-YA MA STAND MASTER: D AN' G What is it shaped like? Carrots that look like Snoopy, breast-shaped radishes, and other shapes are found all the time during harvests. This is just like those. It really just resembles a child. It's alive! Impossible! Jolyne, forget about it and come back! Haven't you noticed? Your legs are turning too. They are attaching to the vines! What is this thing? Is it a plant, or is it a human? It turned the prisoners in the Disciplinary Wing into plants, joined their roots, and became a fruit! The bone must have gotten implanted inside this fruit. Pale Snake is at this prison to discover what lies beyond this point. What will it spawn? He wants to know what transpires when it is born. I told you to come back, Jolyne. The sun is moving westward, causing more sunlight to enter. You must move further back. Are you taking that with you? We call this seizing by force, F.F. I will not let Pale Snake have it. Come, Jolyne. We must move opposite the sun's direction. Anastasia. This wing's entrance is to the west. We'll never leave this shitty place if we go east. There's at least one other Stand User somewhere in this wing. Escape, huh. Help me, please. Someone help! Please! After everyone drowned, they turned into plants and d*ed! How horrible! I'm begging you! I don't want to turn into a plant! Please, get me out of here! Fine. What's your name? Are you hurt? What are you saying, Anastasia? He could be our enemy. Are they right? Are you against us? I don't know what you are talking about. My name is Guccio. I just don't want to turn into a plant! Calm down. I said it's fine. Stand up, Guccio. Surely you can do that much. Now hurry it up. Do you know this? A human has  pairs of ribs, or  bones in total. Whether a man or a woman, tall or short, we all have the same number of ribs. Good. Now go. I guess he wasn't our enemy after all. I couldn't care less either way. I'm only interested in safely leaving through the east side of this building. Isn't that right? The keyword is "safely." Let's leave from there. A green child… I wasn't told about any of this, but my job is simple. Finish off Jolyne Cujoh. Just that, and nothing more. I will merely complete my assignment. Where are they? Where did Jolyne Cujoh and her two allies go? Have they already left the building? No, they cannot leave without me knowing. Hey you, what are you doing there? Hey, I'm talking to you. Where did those three go? And how did you manage to avoid becoming a plant? Walk… outside… -Save me… -How terrible. Someone restructured his body into a human trap! f*ck, it hurts! Mommy, it hurts! I don't want this shitty arm anymore! I got screwed. I'm only here because Pale Snake ordered me to cause a fight in here with my Survivor Stand. But forget that now. I'm finally outside now. GUCCIO STAND NAME: SURVIVOR - BEYOND RECOVERY Anyway, it looks like we got away from the other Stand User. The plants withered away. I guess it was a temporary bloom. The problem is that it's about time for someone from the prison to realize the abnormalities going on in the Disciplinary Wing. That works in our favor. Once that happens, then Pale Snake will realize it too. He will appear close to us. This is the best chance yet of getting my father's disc back. Jolyne, watch out! Stone Ocean! It's an enemy Stand! He must belong to that gladiator-looking man! He swallowed the fruit! I won't let them have it! assh*le! Diver Drive! What is up with his body? He stinks… really bad! Go deeper, please! -sh*t, my Stand can't enter it! -Punish me more, please! I can feel it through my Stand! My body's starting to stink from the inside! Those shoes of yours. Did my bodily liquid dirty them? I am very sorry. Now please, come sit on this chair. Let me lick your shoes clean. Would you like this comic book? I lifted it from the guards' break room. Careful, there's a bee. My master is named D an' G. The last I saw of him, he was in the Disciplinary Wing. His right arm got ripped off and he was crying for his mommy. It's a remotely controlled Stand! He wants to take the fruit to his User! sh*t, they've noticed. The guards are coming! Jolyne, we must leave for now. Let's go toward the wetlands. There must be a water bike or a boat somewhere close. This is how to tell wild strawberries apart. The ones with yellow flowers are mock strawberries, so don't eat them. Shut your annoying trap. We can't leave this Stand alone. We need to find a way to get that green child out of its belly. I know that. F.F., we have no choice but to take it. We'll leave you to find its User and finish him off. Got it. Oh, you want me to go with you, Master. This boat here is built specifically for the wetlands, Master. It has a propeller engine, and it uses wind to propel forward. sh*t, how do I start the ignition? Is there a lock somewhere? It's a throttle lever, Master. Usually, it must be put in neutral first, like this. This stick is for steering. Push it forward to turn the empennage to the right, and pull the stick back to turn it to the left. -Release the tether. -Yes, Master. Jolyne, do not take your eyes off that Stand. While it's in your sight, it'll act like an obedient servant. Though creepy, it will prove useful to you. But turn your back on it for a second, and… f*ck… Who would have thought that was an att*ck? Jolyne, Anastasia… Don't let it out of your sight!
05x20 - F.F. – The WitnessQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:30Do not chase the bone. Leave it be. Let his bone wander about freely. Then, I will combine it with Jotaro Kujo's memory. I will learn the truth! The bone must have gotten implanted inside this green fruit. Pale Snake is at this prison to discover what lies beyond this point. What will it spawn? He wants to know what transpires when it is born. We'll leave you to find its User and finish him off. f*ck… Who would have thought that was an att*ck? His bodily fluids… He used his spit to destroy my mouth before I realized it. He att*cked me slowly, little by little. What should I do? Should I go after Jolyne's boat? No. I will stick to my mission and go finish off that Stand's User. This is the most definite way. EPISODE : F.F. - THE WITNESS Hey you. Head toward that island. Why are we stopping at this hidden place? Hey, turn off the engine. Don't make a sound. Don't you hear that? I said hurry up and turn off the engine, idiot! Emergency in the Disciplinary Wing area. The entire facility is on Level  security. Stay on high alert! That's a .mm M heavy machine g*n. Its range is , to , meters. A mere graze from that b*llet would blow our limbs off. This old boat would be sh*t into pieces. Hey, shut up. You're shaking the boat. Stay away from the steering! Stay calm. If they had spotted us, we would've been sh*t at. Ten o'clock. There was an unusual splashing by the bushes. Maybe a fish or an alligator? They're coming. We should leave! Grab the leaves like this, master. I told you to be quiet, dimwit! No. I'm folding these leaves in half. Here, let's weave it and rest it here. Stick them here like this. And now, let's paint your face. Excellent. Good, now let's get your face ready. Emergency report! All guards, return to the Disciplinary Wing! I repeat, everyone back to their posts! Turn back? I'm not sure what's happening, but it sounds pretty serious. Let's head back. Where the hell did these guys come from? Damn! Turn the engine on, hurry up! It won't start in time! We'll get sh*t before it gets going! You there! What have you done at the Disciplinary Wing? Listen! Do not move! Put your hands on the floor! Stay down! I said don't move, bastard! Hit the ground, now! -Our boat! -We can take their boat. And you're doing it for us. What just hit us? I'm taking this boat. I'm sure you don't mind. Don't get eaten by alligators on your way back. Diver Drive! Jolyne, are the plants still growing inside you? Let's continue heading east. The sun is still going down. So mean, tossing me around like I was a sack… Oh, well. Hey Jolyne, I'm sorry, but can you stop whistling? We might hear the guards' boats again. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, ANASTASIA? ANASTASIA! HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME? I can't speak! ANASTASIA! MY VOICE! IT'S NOT COMING OUT! ANASTASIA! This Stand… He's here to do more than just run off with the green child! He was slowly attacking us! What's the matter? You are breathing hard. I feel the same way, Jolyne. Can you feel my heart pounding? You are suddenly getting close to me. Do you finally understand how I feel for you? Not my eyes, my tongue! Are you at a loss for words? I know how you feel. But there's no need for words between us. I feel the same about you. You're dying to kiss me, right? You want a deep kiss already? When, and how did he att*ck us? I didn't notice at all. I have to keep him in my sights! Jolyne… Well, which is it? Do you want to kiss, or not? I know, is this a kink? Like, you are particular about your kissing angle… An auto-tracking Stand. It follows our orders like a sl*ve and acts docile like a servant. It pretends to be harmless. But that's his method. It's a Stand that strikes when its prey lets their guard down! At this rate, we're both toast. Bring it on. Try to att*ck me. I must make Anastasia see what's happening. YA-YA MA. That's my name. YA-YA MA. Let me show you how to tan frog hide. Look here. Rub this mixture made of fat and brains all creamy and thick on the back of the frog skin. This smoothes the hide. If you want, I can go get ten more and tailor up the coolest super mini-skirt using their hide. It'll make your legs look ultra-long and slim, and your hips will look wide! Jolyne, what is the matter? Seriously. If a trigger is necessary, there must be a trigger to his att*cks! And if they're a*t*matic, then… This is what I was waiting for. I covered my skin with my threads and waited for something to touch it. His att*cks set off automatically when we turn away. That's his ability. And now, I know how he att*cks. He uses mosquitoes! Jolyne, what's going on? Jolyne! Was I wrong? Does he not use mosquitoes? Or is he attacking in other ways too? BE ALL EYES DON'T EVER LOOK AWAY You… Bastard! Master, you want me to keep driving this boat? Or do you want to fight me one-on-one? Or will you escape-- I was wrong. He doesn't use mosquitoes. He att*cks in other ways. Yes, give me more! He att*cks in a way that can't be seen by the naked eye! Run! I do believe this is your last chance to escape. I hope you are prepared. Prepared to regret ever being born in this world. STAND NAME: DIVER DRIVE STAND MASTER: NARCISO ANASTASIA Go to the back of the boat, at the corner of the port! Take out everything you're hiding. Spread them out by my feet. Now, show them to me! Two rhino beetles, a microphone for singing, low-calorie sugar packs, and three frogs. One raw frog hide, a bundle of broccoli, four mock strawberries, and two used matchsticks. No, his belongings are irrelevant. We are upwind of him, yet he is able to att*ck us. An auto-tracking Stand… Your target is set, is that right? Yes sir, my target is absolutely locked on to Jolyne Cujoh since the very first time I touched her. Your User commanded you to target her. You won't try to escape until you've finished her off. YA-YA MA. And if you want to be by her side, master, I will finish you off along with Jolyne. Could he be using his spit to att*ck? YA-YA MA. You still don't get it, do you? You can't destroy or stop me, ever. The only way to survive was to run away from me. This boat… Should I stop it? This splattering water… If the spit he uses to att*ck has already permeated the wetland waters, then… Now, stand and go to the driver's seat. Crank up the speed. Now get up. No, you'll make things worse. If you speed up the boat, the water will splash everywhere. Yes, if that's what you want, master. Ribbit! Jolyne, he stopped attacking although the boat's speed hadn't changed. YA-YA MA. Something's not right… Birds! Hide! Diver Drive. I don't care how he att*cks. Since he is a perfect auto-tracking Stand, I buried a frog in his head and connected its brain to his tracking sensors. Try to track us as a frog as long as you exist! Wait… what was I going to do? I am an auto-tracking Stand. My mission is to defeat Jolyne Cujoh and return with the green child. Oh, dear. I have no time to be bumming around! I have to spatter my spit to att*ck Anastasia! I'll create a static charge by causing friction between the plastic and the propellers. That'll make my spit fly everywhere! He'll never figure it out! Oh, but those birds are so scary! Hide! Ew, I peed myself like those frogs do! Woah, what a cutie! Look at those curves! Let me ride you, darling! Oh, a rhino beetle! He won't bother us anymore. We need F.F.'s help to heal the wounds. All we need to do is wait for F.F. to finish D an' G off and meet up with us. What the hell happened to the Disciplinary Wing? Where are the guards and the prisoners? We've only been gone for around ten minutes! Where did these plants even come from? How do we explain this? What is that prisoner's condition? Is he able to talk? Prisoner ME, D an' G. He is in critical condition. His right arm almost got ripped off. We can't question him. I'll blow his head off for setting loose a Stand that's creepy as hell. That man, isn't he the prison's priest, Father Pucchi? What is a priest doing here? sh*t, forget about him for now. What's more important is the definite death of D an' G. Three hundred fifty-nine. Three hundred sixty-seven. Three hundred seventy-three. Three hundred seventy-nine. Three hundred eighty-three. Three hundred eighty-nine. Three hundred ninety-seven. And now, the four hundreds. First, four hundred one. Then, four hundred nine. D an' G is gravely injured, meaning… I must conclude that Jolyne Cujoh is still alive. And the plethora of withered plants… I take it that Dio's bone caused this. Dio's bone is using the prisoners' bodies to accomplish something outside of my imagination. Splendid. This is wonderful. So it has finally begun. I've been waiting for this moment for  years. What D an' G witnessed here… I must ask him what he saw, in person! Isn't that right, Survivor's Guccio? It seems you didn't see what happened, but the plants must have set something in motion. Doesn't this call for a celebration? It will be in my hands soon. What is true happiness? I will attain heaven. Sing praises. The thing that will be born is heaven itself. The curtains to the new world have risen. Splendid… Yes, praise this moment! Handel's "Messiah" is a true masterpiece! How befitting… It's as if the music exudes light. It is said that Handel led this piece even the day before his own death! All right, leave D an' G to the medics. Question him after his treatment. We must search for the other prisoners and guards. -Now, go. -Yes, sir. No, I will question him before he is treated. I must not let what was conceived get lost! Good. Now, start the car. Yes, sir. That woman… That face underneath the hat! You're done now. Those who control auto-tracking Stands are defenseless when the tables turn on them. That's the risk you bear! It's F.F.! Why are they at this Disciplinary Wing? Since when? This is bad! They were after D an' G! He has a disc! Pale Snake is nearby! Where is he? Where did he throw the disc from? Four hundred seventy-nine. Four hundred eighty-seven. Four hundred ninety-one. Four hundred ninety-nine. No way… The one who threw it was… It can't be him! This is bad. It's very bad for me. You are able to att*ck D an 'G here and now because his Stand YA-YA MA is tracking Jolyne. Pale Snake's User is… This can't be! There are things I must learn from him. I cannot have him die yet. So the one who controls Pale Snake is… If that's true, then what? Which do you prioritize? Is it me? Or is it finishing D an' G? You are… Father Pucchi. You bastard!
05x21 - AWAKENQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:31You're done now. Those who control auto-tracking Stands… It's F.F.! Why are they at this Disciplinary Wing? He has a disc! Pale Snake is nearby! Where is he? No way… The one who threw it was… It can't be him! So the one who controls Pale Snake is… You are… Father Pucchi. F.F. feared one thing above all else. It wasn't the destruction of their body, but the elimination of their own intellect. I remember everything since the day I met Jolyne. The weird graffiti on prison phones, the lint-covered blankets on the bed, and the smell of garbage. The guard's shouts, the sounds of doors opening and closing, and the toilet flushing, even. Fooling around with Jolyne and the others and laughing together. I remember them all. But before I met Jolyne at the farm, though I lived there for years, all I can recall from that time are memories that are like a machine's. That's all. I followed orders without ever questioning why and spent the days guarding Pale Snake's discs. But now, I know that to live means to make memories. I fear losing them the most. Jolyne is on a mission to save her father and is willing to risk her life for the ones she cares about like Ermes. That's probably because she has good memories of them. That's what powers humans up. Memories give humans power to keep going at a cellular level. This is an understanding that I, F.F., lacked before meeting Jolyne. That's right. That is… That is what it means to be an intelligent being. Which do you prioritize? Is it me? Or is it finishing D an' G? You hesitated for a split second! That will cost you your life! I gave you intellect and a Stand. I am taking it back. When I think about Jolyne, I feel courage swelling up inside me. This is what memories do. This is… my intellect! What? No… Is F.F. planning to-- Their bodily fluids entered his body! Impossible… Am I… Looks like F.F. did it. They must have k*lled its User. Where is the fruit? What the hell? Does this mean that it's born? Is this what Pale Snake wanted? What the hell is this thing? Why was it given life? Why does it exist here? Were the prisoners mutated just to give life to this thing? Now that it's born, my body is no longer mutating. It stopped turning into a plant. You must not let F.F. escape! Read the memory inside the disc! Tell me the whereabouts of the spawn of Dio's bone! Will I even last  seconds when I'm exposed like this? I need water. I need to tell Jolyne who Pale Snake really is! sh*t. I have to tell her that he's the prison's chaplain, Father Pucchi! Are you trying to reach the faucet at the entrance? Before you go, I have one question for you! You can't escape my Stand! There's one thing I want to ask, F.F. It's a very simple question. Did you see it? Did you see the thing born at the Disciplinary Wing? How did it look? Was it a plant? Was it beautiful? What is a priest doing at a prison like this? I hope you understand that I'm asking the questions here. I can easily extract your memory and read it to understand what was born. But I wanted to know how you felt. Things like it looked soft or that it was beautiful are your opinions, and can't be read from a memory disc. Are you worried that the spawn will escape? You're afraid of losing it. Is it able to move already? How the hell should I know? I'd be more worried about it getting destroyed. No, maybe it's already done. Jolyne is with that mean assh*le, after all. If she's compelled to, she'll finish it off. It's impossible to defeat it. That will never happen. No one can destroy it, that much I know well. My only concern is Jolyne causing trouble and losing it. Jotaro's memory alone is enough to control the birthed creature, and I have his memory. We are so close to the end. What is it shaped like? Did it grow faster than you expected? I thought it was gonna drown in water. And then, what else was there? Let's see… It's stalling for time! Turn around! I did it! My soul isn't in my head, it's over there. I have water now! I can go tell Jolyne everything! Your soul, you say? No matter where your intelligence lies, you're not the one making decisions here. I am the one who endowed you with a Stand ability. You filthy plankton! Don't you dare give me explanations, as if you know better than I do! My body! This water… What is streaming out of it? No, it can't be! It's steaming hot water. No aquatic organism on earth can dwell in water hotter than  degrees Celsius. A different Stand ability that turns water into hot water… …was inserted into this thing. Only I get to decide where your intellect lies. You are using your own ability to turn the water you touch into boiling hot water! Jolyne! STAND NAME: GREEN, GREEN, GREEN HOME STAND MASTER: THE GREEN BABY Where is it? Where did it fall? sh*t, don't tell me it drowned. No… Does it have a mind of its own? Since it's trying to escape? No… Instinct is its only drive. I don't know whether it's a plant or not, but I don't want it to go anywhere. I can't let Pale Snake have it. Jolyne! Wait, Jolyne! Don't move, look at the rock by your foot! Listen closely. Don't take another step. Turn around and look at me. When the pebble rolled over here, it turned into a rock. Meanwhile, Jolyne, you grew smaller. Stop! I said don't go near it! What just happened, Anastasia? Why did you grow shorter? -What's going on, Anastasia? -Stay calm, Jolyne. By the way, how big does that baby look to you? It hasn't changed. Its size is the same as before. Anastasia, it looks like you are the one who grew shorter to me. What's going on? The baby's size looks about average to me too. Only the pebble we kicked over got smaller. Jolyne, don't move. Stay right where you are. You're back to normal. Do you think that this is the baby's ability? The closer we get to the baby, the shorter we grow. I don't have a clue. That's a heavy line of questioning. Now listen, if we get halfway to the baby, my height shrinks by half. That means we have to walk twice as much. Okay. Furthermore, if we get a fourth of the way to the baby, then the distance grows by four times. At one-eighth, we walk eight times as much. /nd, /th, /th… Our body will keep shrinking, while the distance multiplies more and more. Here is the question. Will we ever reach that baby? I say no, not in an eternity. But in order to get my father's memory back, I have to get the baby. -Jolyne. -Anastasia, we'll think after we've done everything we can! It's her focus. The way Jolyne can fixate towards one goal. I'm here because I'm drawn to the way she focuses on one thing. The ability to concentrate enhances a person's beauty. Those eyes… In time, I'll have you gaze at me with that intense focus of yours. Stone Ocean! I'm about to reach it! I can catch it! It's no use, Jolyne. Pull your thread back! There is no way to reach the baby! I can't give up! There has to be an end. I mean, it's right there! What do you say to jumping off from here? If I do, I'll reach an end point. The ground is the finishing point. I have to land at some point! Stop, Jolyne! Don't-- Yes! The ground is right there! I can almost reach it! What's happening? My string… What the hell is that? Don't tell me… Is this the baby's Stand? Damn, haven't I reached the ground yet? It hasn't only grown in size, but in power as well! Its power has multiplied! This Stand… It appeared just to drag me down, so I won't ever escape this never-ending fall! Stone Ocean! If this is the baby's ability, then catching the Stand is the same as catching the User! I'm shrinking! It's trying to reduce me to nothing! The end I thought I'd reach wasn't the ground. It was this Stand! Diver Drive. The closer you get to the baby, the smaller you get. Eventually, you will be reduced to nothing. I don't know why a baby with such a powerful Stand was born, but I know he will be an enemy someday. Jolyne, this baby is your enemy. But… if there's no way to defeat it, then I really can't let Pale Snake have it. Anastasia, hold on tight! It threw the rock! Does that mean… that it's thinking for itself? The baby is now deliberately using its ability! It's coming. Climb! We need to escape as fast as possible! Run! No matter how much we chase it, we will never reach that baby. But at least, we caught the Stand. Jolyne, do you still not see what we were climbing toward? It was a gamble. The baby is intelligent and curious. Earlier, it touched the bottle I threw. When the baby chooses to touch an object, its size stays the same. In other words, the bottle's size hasn't changed. If we can't catch the baby, we'll have the baby chase after us. We finally reached the bottle. The Stand is inside the bottle now. All we have to do now is trap it inside the bottle! But… how are we getting out of here? I'm having Diver Drive enter the bottle's wall. It's bringing the mouth to us. Let's go, Jolyne. Run for it! We finally caught it. We got its User, the baby too. It's changing its position. It's using the bottle to charge forward! Anastasia! Stone Ocean! Jolyne! You can't break the bottle. We'll be worse off if we have to face the Stand! Did the baby have this in mind when it rolled the bottle? sh*t, we're in deep trouble now! -Don't break the bottle! -But… At this rate, you're done for! Anastasia, look… What the hell? What's going on? Jolyne, looks like… it's interested in the star-shaped birthmark on your left shoulder. Since it touched you, we turned back to our original size. The baby has the same birthmark on its shoulder. What's going on? The baby acts like it has known Jolyne for a long time. Hey, it looks as if it likes me. What should I do? It likes her? No, that's not it. I have no doubt about it. He will turn against us. I can only sense endless darkness from this baby's ability. Yes, we may need this baby to retrieve your father's disc from Pale Snake, but I must k*ll it while I can.
05x22 - Time for Heaven! New Moon! New Priest!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:32Hey, Pucchi… Did you know? The average number of daily visitors at the Louvre, Paris in the spring is about ,. Since its doors opened in , more than , people flock to view the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo every day. The visitors do not leave without seeing these two pieces. Isn't that incredible? Incredible? Do you mean the number of guests? That's not it. Some of the world's greatest painters and sculptors are able to express their souls in a form that can be seen by eyes. It's as if they create Stands that exist beyond time and place. Wouldn't you agree? It's an interesting thought. Does that make Leonardo Da Vinci and Alexandros of Antioch Stand Users? Yes, but I'm also talking about you. Your Pale Snake is able to extract and store souls by giving it form. Will you betray me one day? Why do you not att*ck me? You know that I would not survive in sunlight and that I lay to rest in the dark room during the day. All you have to do is finish me off while I sleep. If you turn my Stand, The World, into a disc and take it, you yourself could become king. So do it. That has never even crossed my mind. I like people who help me grow. You are the king among kings. I want to follow you and see what kind of end you will reach. I love you, in the same manner as men love their god. Sorry, that wasn't meant to insult you. It's that I've never considered that there was a man who could calm my soul just by us talking. I feared losing you. You will become a noble priest. Please, accept this. It is a symbol of my apology. I extracted it out of my body just now. No matter where you are, I will always be able to lend you my powers. EPISODE : TIME FOR HEAVEN! NEW MOON! NEW PRIEST! Jo… Jolyne! Pale Snake. Read Jolyne's whereabouts from that disc. Respond to me. What happened? Is that you there? Respond to me. Can you not hear me? Why is this transceiver here? Who is on the other end? Who? Who the hell is it? All right. I understand. The situation is that serious, huh? I just left the medical wing. Bastard! It's Weather Forecast! This rain… Where is the disc? This bastard! They had Weather Forecast summon rain! You won't escape me! Damn this rain! I can't see anything… where did they go? And it's foggy. Where is this sound of hitting rocks coming from? I think it's Morse Code? Make the fog thicker… They're after me. Pale Snake's User is Father Pucchi! He knows. He knows who I am! Weather Forecast knows! Five hundred three. Count the prime numbers. Five hundred nine. Five hundred twenty-one. Nothing can divide prime numbers. The reason why people lose… Five hundred twenty-three. Shame leads men to defeat. Men die to compensate for their shame. Five hundred forty-one. Thoughts of shameful regret such as "why did I do that earlier" weakens men and leads them to their defeat. I didn't make an error by failing to see the guards' transceiver. No, this is a trial. There are still ways to prevail. Jolyne Cujoh doesn't know who I am yet. Nothing has changed yet. I haven't completely lost them, either. True victors… are those who can reign over the circumstances given to them. It looks like you survived. Weather Forecast. Where are Jolyne and the others? Anastasia. I'm really grateful for everything you've done for me. Thanks to you, I've been safe until now. But why do you care so much about me? Finding out who Pale Snake is and getting my father's memory back is my problem, and mine only. Jolyne, how can you say that when you fully know how I feel towards you? You've already given me so much. I see a bright hope I couldn't find anywhere, inside or outside of the prison. And that's why I'm here with you. Hey, what's this? Why is it latching onto me? I'm not sure. "I'm not sure" isn't an answer. It's chewing on my hair! It's eating dirt too. So, is it actually a plant? Does it need nutrients? But it sleeps a lot too. Jolyne, get down. Something is coming. There are two of them, and they've already closed in on us. F.F.! Jolyne… I know who Pale Snake is. It's Father Pucchi, Jolyne. It was Father Pucchi all along. I almost d*ed. If Weather Forecast hadn't come, I wouldn't be alive right now. F.F.! I'm fine. I only threw out my body. What happened to you guys, Jolyne? Let me heal your right eye. What you said just now… Yes. Father Pucchi was trying to track down the baby's location from D an' G's memory. Now, we only need to corner him. There's finally a way for us to win. Weather Forecast came too. Weather Forecast. Jolyne… Have you recovered from the injuries you sustained at the factory? Yes. I hope you've been okay. What the hell is this? What are those two doing? They are embracing. I know that much! F.F., separate them! Separate them now! I have to do it? Yes, you! Remember our terms? That assh*le's smell is rubbing off on Jolyne! Calm down, it's just a greeting! See? They stopped. Stop being dramatic. We found out Pale Snake's identity. We don't have time for this petty fight. Hey, are you talking back to me? What the hell are you thinking? How dare you forget our promise. You are nothing but plankton. Jolyne, now that we know who Pale Snake is, we don't need this thing anymore. There's no use for it. Let's k*ll it. Give me permission, Jolyne. Wait a minute. It's not your ally, Jolyne. It's not even human. It didn't exist in the first place. This being is lower than animals. It should have never been born. We shouldn't keep unknown creatures like this one alive. So please, let me. Now hold on. You better watch it, Anastasia. Are you talking about me? Careful how you phrase things. Don't touch me. We don't have time for that, plankton. Weather Forecast, you know the situation, right? Give me permission. No. I cannot do that. You are the one who will die. F.F., who the hell did you bring? Bastard… f*ck, you got me. This can't be. This isn't… This can't be happening! He's not Weather Forecast. He's… He's… We were… being tricked. Thank you, F.F., for taking me here before the real Weather Forecast caught up. Five hundred forty-seven. Five hundred fifty-seven. No one can divide prime numbers. It took such a long time. I waited  years. The pinnacle of heights humans are able to achieve… This is undoubtedly it. We finally meet, you who will help me get to heaven! Though incomplete and inchoate, the only thing left for me to do is to trace the memory sealed by Jotaro Kujo. The new moon rises tonight. Dio. No other night is better suited to awaken you once again so that you benefit my cause. Thirty-six of the worst convicts' souls were absorbed and gave rise to this new life form. That's what this green creature is. That reminds me. Before I begin… I must send you to an absolute death where you are forever forgotten. Now stand, Jotaro's daughter. Though I struck a fatal blow, you managed to block a split second faster than the others. If you won't att*ck, then I will! I didn't think this was how I'd find out who you were, Pale Snake. I didn't think I'd see you again like this. I'm taking three things from you. My father's memory, the disc you took from F.F., and your life! What is the meaning of these handcuffs? You've never worn handcuffs before? I had to wear them almost every day ever since your ploy brought me here. You think you caught me with these? Do you know what handcuffs are for? They aren't to keep someone from running away. They are used to make others submit! You still don't seem to understand what you are doing right now. We are connected through these handcuffs. Do you know what that means? Let's see who is the one that's being kept here. I already turned your Stone Ocean into one of my discs. It's so close to falling out, I can almost grab it. Do you see it now? So who is the one in a predicament here, you or me? Well, I really don't get what you are on about… That's all I know. A few millimeters. A few millimeters, and this fight is over. If I can enter just a few millimeters within my range of aerial att*ck, my fist can land a blow. Some swallows die from flying directly into cliff walls. It's because their parents never taught them the safe diving range, leading the swallows to soar at a dangerous angle. It's not that the birds' parents aren't teaching their offspring. The parents cannot teach it because their own parents never taught them. This family of birds tends to have a short lifespan, and they don't even realize why they're prone to dying from accidents. Jotaro had a short lifespan. Stone Ocean is mine! I used her own disc to block her sight… How did she know where I was? Did she use the cuff's vibrations to guess? No, it's her strong will! Her strong will detected my att*ck! When she first entered prison, I thought she didn't even have a Stand ability. She seemed like a helpless little girl crying over some assh*le who used her. This is bad. Her Stone Ocean has an advantage over my Pale Snake. At this rate, I'm done for… But more importantly, the birthed creature will be destroyed! What did you throw just now? What did you do? I'm asking you what you threw! A disc is a physical manifestation of one's soul. It can be stored forever. However, what if the disc is inserted into someone on the brink of death? The disc would perish along with that person's death. That's Jotaro's memory disc you've risked your life for. You can have it back. It's stabbed into Anastasia's dying body. What will you do now? Will you go get the disc? Or will you continue your handcuff death match? It's risky to let go of Jotaro's disc, but I've already memorized the contents of the notebook. All that is left is the execution. What will you choose, Jolyne Cujoh? How can you still be contemplating? Your father is rotting away along with Anastasia as he wastes away! All that I'm after is the birthed creature. I won! As I thought, she chose her father. Spiral staircase, rhinoceros beetle, city of desolation, fig tart, rhinoceros beetle, Via Dolorosa, rhinoceros beetle, singularity point, Giotto, angels, hydrangea, rhinoceros beetle, singularity point, secret emperor. You've shown your interest. Are you willing to approach me? Will this be the beginning of everything? Now, I can depart into your world with you! Hallelujah, Dio! Anastasia! This can't be happening… No… this can't… This isn't true! Somebody! Isn't there anyone around here? Somebody! A guard! I'm right here! Please, I need a doctor! -Hey! -Diver… -Diver… Drive. -Please, somebody! -Can you hear me? -Please, call for help! -F.F… -Please! -Help! -Jolyne is mourning. This is your fault, F.F. sh*t… I'm cold. Actually, I'm freezing. Looks like my heart's already stopped b*ating. I guess her father's memory disc is inside my body. It will disappear, along with my life. I tried to eject it, but I'm fighting to stay awake. Looks like you are crumbling away. Come claim my everything. You have to be the one to do it. I'll leave my intellect for your use. You can use up all the life I have left in me too. You can have my body. So come inside my body and remove the disc for Jolyne. Only you can do it, plankton. Answer me, F.F. We made a deal! You are supposed to follow all my orders. You have to keep your word. You have to stay alive. You can mutate my body as you please. Stop wasting time! My… consciousness… It's… going… This can't be! Anastasia! No… Jolyne. It's going to be all right. It's not how it looks. You've done it. Anastasia… got the disc back for you. F.F., is that you? Are you the one speaking? One thing I feared the most was losing the ability to even think to say goodbye to my friends. But… in the final moment, I could do just that. Jolyne, please tell this to Anastasia once he wakes up. His body belongs to himself. I used his life and intellect to fill his wounds. Hold on! Why are you talking like this, F.F.? Goodbye, Jolyne. I can't be here any longer. F.F. is disappearing. What are you saying? Stop talking like that! Look at me, Jolyne. This is my soul. This is my intellect. I lived a life. I'll do anything to get your disc back from the priest. I'm talking about F.F.'s disc. That will bring you back! That must be a different F.F. I don't think it would be me. Because this is me. This is me, saying goodbye. I'm so glad I got to say my farewells… Jolyne. This is all right, Jolyne. Everything is all right. I'm glad you got your father's disc back. F.F… Respond, F.F. I've lost you, F.F. Where are you? F.F.? Answer me, F.F. F.F.
05x23 - Jail House Lock! / Lock of the Jail!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:33The first need is my Stand. My Stand, The World, and what lies beyond it are the path for men to advance further. My second need is a trustworthy friend. He must be someone who can control his desires. The desire for power, fame, money, sex… He must be free of those things. It must be someone who chooses God's laws over the laws of men. Will I, Dio, ever meet someone with this character trait? I also need at least  souls of the worst convicts. Souls of sinners have tremendous energy. I need  words. To prevent ever forgetting these words, I will etch them onto my Stand itself. I also need courage. I must have the courage to let go of my Stand just once. My decaying Stand will gather and absorb the souls of  convicts. It will then give birth to something new. The spawned creature will awaken. It will be curious about the  words spoken by the trusted friend. My friend will find me trustworthy and he will consider me his friend. Finally, I need the location. It will be north latitude,  degrees  minutes, west longitude,  degrees  minutes. Wait for the next new moon. Heaven will appear then. Good morning, Father. You've grown your hair out. When was the last time you returned home to the mainland? I have no use for this place now. The birthed creature now belongs to me. The only thing left to do is to wait for the time of heaven. EPISODE : LOCK OF THE JAIL! DISCIPLINARY WING This is the worst! How do I get out of this one? This is the highest maximum security measure ever. All the guards have g*ns too. It's too dangerous to be here with all the guards, even for just another minute. Hey, Jolyne, can you hear me? Are you listening? The priest isn't on this island anymore. He already left Green Dolphin Street. He didn't take anything, though. He wasn't carrying a baby with him! It's too boring in here. I even pierced my own belly button. Do you have my father's disc, Emporio? You got it now? Did you get in contact with the Speedwagon Foundation? I can't. The security is too tight right now. I have the disc though, Jolyne. I wouldn't put it down. Never. Good. Well, I'm getting out of here. -Lead the way. -Jolyne. The prison workers think that you are the sole survivor from the Disciplinary Wing. Though they can't pin it on you, you are the only person they can question right now. That's why this cell is under strict observation. Do you want to leave the cell and come to my room? No, Emporio. By leave, I mean getting out of this shitty prison. I don't have any more time to waste. I'm breaking out of the Green Dolphin Island. Show me the fastest way out of here. I promise I'll contact the Speedwagon Foundation. I'll even do that today. Wrong again, Emporio. This problem is much bigger than retrieving my father's disc now. If F.F. were alive, they would be going after that priest as we speak. And now that I read my father's memory, I understand what Pucchi meant by  years. I now understand why my father had to seal Dio's ability. My father would never let the priest get away. And I am Jolyne Cujoh! I have to seal what he has obtained again! Emporio. Do you plan to stay here for the rest of your life? It's up to you, but I want you to come with me. You don't understand, Jolyne. You don't get it at all. But I do. I can break out of these bars in three minutes. But what about after that? No one is left to help you. Ermes, Anastasia… They are still under treatment at the medical wing. For some reason, Weather Forecast has been holed up in his own room. He won't even come visit my room. I can leave through the Ultra Security House Unit. We got to the wetlands. We can't. No jailbreak attempt has ever succeeded. Some prisoners were detained for even contemplating a breakout. Anyway, unless you can stop time like your father, no one can ever leave this prison. I don't know what, but there's something about this place. Something more than surveillance cameras, as if the prison itself was a guard with a mind of its own. Emporio, when is the next new moon? Jolyne, please, just wait for the Speedwagon Foundation. If we risk it, we might even lose this disc we finally retrieved! North latitude,  degrees  minutes. West longitude,  degrees  minutes. Where is that? J-Jolyne… I can't help you with this. I have a message from Pale Snake. Everything is over. Don't try to leave this prison. If you stay here, we won't get in the way of you delivering the disc to Jotaro. You've got guts, I'll give you that. You showed me your face and your Stand. And what's your name? I am Mew Mew. My Stand is called Jailhouse Lock. I'm showing it to you as a warning. Did he order you to finish me off? If your plans are to break out of this jail, then yes. My plans? No, I don't have any plans. I'm leaving now! Her Stand is in the bars! I'll say it one more time, Jolyne Cujoh. Don't touch the bars. The more you think about escaping, the closer you'll be to your death. So this is what your ability does. Take this! What? Do you need me to get someone? Are you okay, Jolyne? Where am I? Why am I here? It's you, Gwess. Am I in the female wing? It hurts! "One, grab a pen as soon as you can." "Two, you can only retain up to three new pieces of information." "Three, defeat the User." "Her name is Mew Mew." What are these writings and who wrote them? Did someone write these while I was asleep? . GO SEE EMPORIO Oh, that's right. I was locked up because of what happened at the Ultra Security House Unit. I gave myself a belly piercing. Then, I ran into Emporio. I told him I'm getting out of here to go after the priest. And then, after that… After that… I… What? After I said I was leaving, I remember someone coming. But who was it? This is my handwriting. Did I write these? No way. When did I write them, though? I don't even remember writing them. Tell me, why am I back here in the female wing? Hey! Answer me! Why are you ignoring me? I must've been sleeping since I don't remember. I'm serious! Oh, also, do you have a pen? I need a pen. Give me one. Hey, you… I'm really serious. Do you think I wrote these on myself? That I wrote on my own body? . YOU CAN ONLY RETAIN UP TO THREE NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION Hey, Gwess… be honest. Have I been asking you the same question over and over again? Can you do me a favor? Can you tell me all the things I've asked you already? "Jolyne, the prison doctor has diagnosed you with temporary amnesia brought on by a great shock you received while in the Hole." "You can only memorize up to three things at a time." "You can still remember the past, but if you memorize a fourth new thing, you will forget one." "However, since this will not affect your life as a prisoner, you were sent back to the female wing two days ago." Two days? I've been here that long? Get better soon, Jolyne. For two days… Have I been repeating the same questions for two whole days? But why? "Defeat the User." "Her name is Mew Mew." This is… Could this be… No, it can't be… It's a Stand ability! They're trying to keep me locked up in here! I'm under att*ck! I remember seeing Emporio. And then… After that… After that… Let's see… I remember something happening. WASH YOUR HANDS DON'T FORGET TO WEAR YOUR PANTIES sh*t! What the hell? By the way, Gwess, do you know anyone named Mew Mew? You haven't asked that yet, Jolyne. Her prisoner cell is upstairs. I think she has ratty, blond hair. She's about your height. I don't know why she's here, but I bet she was whoring around. Where do I go to see her? She was here until a moment ago, Jolyne. She just walked by. Can you tell me how she looks like again? She's about cm. Her hair is platinum blonde and it's ratty. She wears fishnets. This is the female wing. How did I get back here? Who's Mew Mew? What's the matter? No… You just said you wanted lunch. It's almost lunchtime. Is that right? Don't think about getting out of here, Jolyne Cujoh. You can't att*ck me and my Jailhouse Lock, ever. STAND NAME: STONE OCEAN STAND MASTER: JOLYNE CUJOH Pale Snake was the priest. F.F. figured it out for us. And then…. They d*ed, didn't they? Bottoms up. I'll avenge you. Hey! Why are you grabbing food? Give me your ticket first. I'm here to grab the packed lunch. Like I said, ticket first. You won't be sneaking one away. Now show it to me. Stop taking forever. If you don't have it, then leave. Now scram. Next. Did I leave it next to my bed? I've got to write it somewhere so I don't forget it. LEAVE FOOD TICKET IN HERE What? Why am I here again? Oh, why did I come back up here? I can't remember a thing. Why did I come back up here? Hey Jolyne, that's my lunch! You ate a good bit of it! You ate my favorite cheese penne! You left your ticket in your pocket, remember? Sorry. I'll get you another one with my ticket. No, it's fine. Just stop. I can get it, just give me your ticket. Can you write it down somewhere that I have your ticket? Oh, sorry. I GAVE MY FOOD TICKET TO GWESS What's this, a User? Is it referring to a Stand? Oh, that's right. I have to go see Emporio. I tried to break out of the confinement cell. Emporio must have been with me then. Emporio might know something. And I need to get out of here. I GAVE MY FOOD TICKET TO GWESS Hey, I said the mustard's out! There's not a squeeze left in here. Do you have another bottle? Why does it feel like I'm always eating the same food? I don't have an appetite. I'll just eat the cheese penne. Can I sit with you, Jolyne? I'm sitting down here. I stepped on a cockroach earlier. It was so gross. Who is she? She seems to know me. Blonde… Ratty hair… Fishnet tights. What the hell did you do that for? Do you want mustard? What about ketchup? You aren't fond of dressing, are you? It's pretty good. Thanks. By the way, what's your name? Oh, no. I'm so sorry, I spilled it on you! Let's get you clean. Your arm got drenched. We need to go clean it off. Take that jacket off. . YOU CAN ONLY RETAIN UP TO THREE NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION Oh, that's so much better. There, all squeaky clean! Let's check your pocket too. That's a gift from me. Jailhouse Lock. Anyone who touches the cell bars with my Stand in it to try and escape can then only remember three pieces of information. Their life is then restricted by the three memories. It's worse than not having any memories at all. They experience over and over again that everything they do is meaningless. Eventually, this cycle of failure becomes etched in their bodies. They then lose all drive to escape. You can even say that they are crippled. This is what you get for trying to break out. What do I need to do? What's important to me? What shouldn't I forget? That's all I need to get out of this trap. I just need one thing! I need to recall it now. If I don't recall it right this minute, I'll forget it forever! Just one thing! What matters to me? GO SEE EMPORIO This is all I need. I'll leave one memory open. These two things. These two things are all I need. The rest, I don't need. I need to leave this place! I spilled… my water. I need to… unplug the power. The power is shorting out. Or else, I can't leave out of that exit to go see Jolyne. I have things I need to tell Jolyne! I can't forget them! I have to leave this room! I spilled my water. MEMORY ONE: I SPILLED MY WATER I need to… unplug the power. MEMORY TWO: I NEED TO UNPLUG THE POWER The power is shorting out. MEMORY THREE: THE POWER IS SHORTING Or else, I can't leave out of that exit… MEMORY FOUR: OR ELSE, I CAN'T LEAVE THIS ROOM TO GO SEE JOLYNE MEMORY THREE …to go see Jolyne. Wait a second. "Go see Emporio"? I'm sure I read that name on her arm. I need to go make sure. No one can escape this place. GO SEE EMPORIO

Stop rewinding it so much! No sh*t, now I'm lost too! Get this bitch out of here! Fine, I'll leave. Greenie, that's the head honcho of all the other spiders in this cell. Hello sir, great to meet you. I'm Pit Viper Ron. Yes, good to meet you. And this spider right here's about to croak. Oh, hey. The hell? What's funny about it? I don't get this comic at all. Oh, why did I come to this recreation room? . YOU CAN ONLY RETAIN UP TO THREE NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION That's right… I'm in a predicament. I came here to find a way out of this situation. The medical wing is beyond this corridor. The stairs on the way lead to Emporio's room. It's usually not a hassle, but the area is heavily guarded today. How can I reach Emporio? IF ANYONE KEEPS LOOKING AT MY LEFT HAND, DON'T HESITATE JUST PUNCH She has a Stand! It looks familiar too. I have to chase it. She's my enemy! She's the Stand User! EPISODE : JAILBREAK… Where… am I? And who was I trying to chase just now? There she is. -Target found at the corner of D--. -Hands in the air! I was wrong, I'm the one being chased! She's right there! Hey, don't move! What the… Was there just one guard coming from this way? No, that doesn't matter right now. Where is this? Where the hell am I? Why am I being chased? Where is she? I swear she ran this way! Keep looking. We have to find her! There's no way we lost her. She must be hiding somewhere close! She may have ran towards the stairs. That's not possible. She would have to walk right past us. Stairs? "Go see Emporio…" That's right, that flight of stairs leads to Emporio's room. What's going on? That's right, I spilled some water. GO TELL JOLYNE I have to tell Jolyne. I have to print something. We'll end up forgetting it, so I have to show her the guard's face. Or else, I can't tell her. MEW MEW, AGE  LEAD GUARD Jolyne Cujoh. You can't retain more than three new pieces of information. Even if you saw four guards, you can't remember more than three of them. Even though the fourth guard is in your line of sight, your brain rejects it since that's too much to remember. You wanted to go see Emporio, so I let you guide me here. So I see. I didn't know there was a room here. Emporio! Jolyne. -How long have you been here? -I got here just now. Your poor hands. What happened to them? The writings on your arms… You can only remember three new things. You're in the same boat as I am! Ever since that time in the confinement cell! That's right, I was hoping to see you. I have to tell you something, Jolyne! What's this? What was I doing just now? What? Jolyne? When did you get here? -And why did you come? -Right, why am I here? -Why? -Why? Oh, that's right. I'm here to see you. I don't know what for, but there was a really serious reason for me to come see you. Print it out. I have to print something out. If I don't, it'll be forgotten forever. Printing is the only way to remember it. Print what out, Emporio? What are you talking about? Huh? But how would I do that? What was I trying to print out? "Mew Mew, Lead Guard." It makes sense now. So he was with you when my Stand activated. He had seen my face and heard me say my name. Emporio was hiding in the walls of the confinement cell. Usually, I'd let him be. My Jailhouse Lock's job is to keep Stand Users behind bars. But if he's trying to leave a record of me, then that changes everything. I now deem you an escapee. Her Stand, Stone Ocean. b*ll*ts won't give her a scratch. But her memory would have been impaired had I fired four sh*ts. Her brain wouldn't even register the fourth sh*t, let alone the smoke from it! Jolyne… What? I don't know why there's a room in a place like this, and what a little boy is doing here. But Pale Snake had told me that Jolyne Cujoh has allies from the inside who have been helping her -using walkie-talkies and the like. -Emporio! So this little boy was her ally. And now, any record he had about me is gone. I won't forgive you! Wow, how caring. But even that anger you feel right now will be completely forgotten with the next three pieces of information. That's my Stand Jailhouse Lock's ability. Take this. Meet your end, Jolyne Cujoh! You won't be able to see more than three of the sh*ts. The others will leave a hole in your body! An image reflected on water is the one whole truth. You might be able to sh**t many sh*ts at once, but I can see their reflections all at once. I hope you haven't forgotten about this one. AVENGE EMPORIO That bitch… But I managed to destroy the computer. Now, I just have to escape. Jolyne will forget about me soon anyway. She will never be able to remember who I am! Emporio, hang in there for just a bit longer. I will go after her. Don't, Jolyne. You'll forget everything the moment you step out of this room. You'll even forget about defeating her. So, please… Emporio, I understand why you are so careful. It was a skill you needed to develop to survive inside these prison walls. But there comes a time when we have to move forward, even if that means facing danger. And for me, that time is now! Is this her string? STAND NAME: JAILHOUSE LOCK STAND USER: MEW MEW Why am I injured? But there comes a time when we have to move forward, even if that means facing danger. I don't know why… but I feel like there's something I have to do… What was it? That's right, print it out. I have to tell Jolyne. I have to print something out… but what was I trying to print? My room doesn't even have a printer. COMPUTE She's strong! She is the enemy I'm after. I can't let her get away. I need you back here! I'm at the D stairwell! Look, she's over there! Lead Guard Mew Mew is being assaulted! The gate! Open the gate! This place… Why am I here? Hurry! Capture her! Am I… being chased? The three guards are here now. Now, you will never recall that I exist! Now, try to run away just a little bit. Then, the guards will sh**t you to death. Before you go, those hands of yours… I almost forgot that they can block g*nshots. My duty is strictly to keep Stand Users confined in this facility. But I feel great right now. It feels great to watch you get sh*t to death. Because you brought this upon yourself. You wanted to walk out of your line, so this is what you get. There she is. And I love that you can't see more than three guards! -I've found her! -There she is! No one can escape my Jailhouse Lock! Jolyne… How long have you been here? Emporio, it's you! I have to tell you… I have to print this out for you. If I don't, you won't be able to remember her. Print it out? Binaries. These are binaries made up of ones and zeroes. I must have computed this. You can print it correctly. We are going to imprint it into your memory! Stone Ocean! They're binary numbers. The binary system can express anything. Draw zeroes and ones using your thread. You can use Stone Ocean as a printer that can express images! Can I consider you my enemy? Are you an enemy? What? She's talking nonsense. She can't even see me. Now, be gone. Thanks. So I guess you are an enemy after all. What's happening? She has Mew Mew hostage! Emporio. Her Jailhouse Lock is no longer active. Yes. I'm okay now. Great. I'm leaving now. Like I told you before, I'm leaving this prison. What are you going to do? If you plan on staying here, then you should go back to your room. Jolyne, my time to leave is now. I… I want to see the outside world! Look, a child. Why is there a child in prison? Either way, keep your guard up! Come, Emporio. Let's go. Excuse me. Sorry, coming through. Sorry, excuse me. What? Who was I trying to g*n down? -What am I doing here? -Why am I here? Great job, Mew Mew. I'm glad you understand. First, we are going to the medical wing to treat Emporio's wound. I'm counting on you to keep us safe, Jailhouse Lock. An undefeated ability that restricts the enemy's memory. Where… am I? Do you have my father's disc? Yes. I've had it with me the entire time. Hey, Jolyne! It's Jolyne. Emporio, you too. Ermes. I heard a commotion. I knew it had to be you guys. Who is she? She is this prison's lead guard. What? Does that mean you're… Yes. We are breaking out. We're about to leave this place. You're going after that priest. That's right, Ermes. I have to seal what he took. I'm ready for anything. Things even worse than what we faced in this prison. Take me with you then. Father, thank you. I don't mean to be rude, but are you feeling okay? Yes, I'm just a little tired. Are you… sure? Excuse me. What is this? What's wrong with these eggs? A Stand… Pale Snake is no longer my Stand ability. Something else is inside me… but what? I feel terrible… Something is running loose inside me. This power, it's beyond my control. But this power carries hope. I can at least feel hope within this power. Dio's memo inside Jotaro's memory… It seems this power needs the things in that memory.

First, we need to securea means of transportation.   EPISODE   : Bohemian Rhapsody ( )   What did you say?   Weather Report.   Jolyne is no longer   in the prison's Female Wardnor the solitary cells.   I can tell by the shift in the air.   It must mean that she managed to escape.   Hold on a second.   A star-shaped birthmark.   What exactly are you?   I saw the same birthmark   on the back of The Green Baby's neck.   And I've heard that Jolyne's fatheralso has the same mark.   If you can't recall, then surmise.   How did you end up at Green Dolphin?   You say you don't have any memories,   but doesn't that meanthe priest took your memory disc?   One thing is for certain. He's our enemy.   I will break out, track the man,and defeat him to learn the truth.   What will you do?   Two convicts have escapedThe Green Dolphin Street State Prison.   The convicts' names areJolyne Cujoh and Ermes Costello.   We have released their photosand are seeking information.   Jolyne got past Mew Mew's Stand,   and is now coming after me.   The hell?

We're nowhere near your destination,but it's as far as we can go.   I'll radio for another cab.   No, here is fine. I'm not in a hurry.   I've felt ill since I took on my new form.   Five days remainuntil the next new moon rises.   I must keep them away,   whether it's Jolyne or someone else.   Hurry, he's in cardiac arrest!   He's a robber.The police sh*t him in the leg.   He then jumped offthe sixth floor of the building!   This one's a biker g*ng member,   speeding on the wrong side of the roadand lost control!   What the hell is with tonight?   This one's a drug addict. He's in shock!   Stay back, bastards!   The drug addict woke up!   sh*t, he's stabbing his hostage!   Put your g*n down!   There's no way in hellI'm getting thrown in prison!   Code    .   Requesting backup at the state hospital.   Hey fucker!   You're going to mumblebut pretend like you don't hear me?   I'm f*cking pissed!I'm shoving these scissors in his neck!   I saw sh**ting stars in the sky earlier.   -There were three.-What?   I'm quite certain.There were three sh**ting stars.   Where did you come from?   You don't know what you are, do you?   He stabbed the hostage!   That wasn't…   No, it wasn't you,but these scissors are positioned   a mere millimeter awayfrom severing my nerves.   This is a coincidence.   It just so happened to s*ab mein a way that isn't fatal.   What will you do? It's all in your hands.   Will you move the scissorsever so slightly?   Before you decide,do you believe in gravity?   There's a gravitational forcethat draws one person to another.   I have become a believerin this very moment.   You cannot k*ll me.   You are here becauseyou were drawn in by my pull.   Stop wasting time on dr*gs.   Redirect your energy tothe things that it's intended for.   f*ck this!    You all must not know    who your father is.    Soon, you will find out.    A gravitational pull    draws one person to another.    Ouch.    My, thank you.    It's nothing serious.    It's just an old knee injurythat aches when it rains.    Your knee aches when it rains.    Yes, that's right.    Thank you, son.    Don't get into people's business.    Our backs may no longer haveThe Green Dolphin logo,    but our jailbreak is all over the news.    We must find a car andgain distance immediately.    No stolen cars.    The authorities will be able totrack a stolen vehicle.    It will only interfere withfinding the priest.    So what, you want to take the bus?    Are we going to wait at the bus stop?    Hey, you two.    Are you taking the bus?    The next bus is an hour away.    How about you hop onto my truck?    If you don't mindsitting in the bed, that is.    You were very kind to me,    so I feel very good right now.    Even the pain in my knee is gone.    I've never felt better.    The clouds are starting to part too.    Weather Report.    We're in luck.Let's ride with him, Anasui.    Jolyne had better be safe.    How is she getting to places?    Jolyne is headed north.    I sense that for sure.    North. We must head north.    There's a famous theme parkin a city up north.    Have you ever been?    That's right, you can't remember.    There's one characterwho's especially famous at the park.    Maybe even you'd recognize him…    What a joke.    None of the characters are printed!    Watch out! We're not alone.    Could it be an enemy?    Diver Down!    Got it!    Anasui, there's more than one.    Either way, I caught one of them.    What the hell is it?    Search, Weather Report.The Stand User must be nearby.    I doubt it's this old man.    He has no reason to stage a happenstance    just to close in on us.    Then someone else must be close by.    Just as you felt Jolyne's movements,the priest must sense yours.    He could be sending enemies after us.    What are you? Spill it!    You don't want to do that.    It's in your best interest to not hurt me.    Children around the world will weep!    The hell was that?    Can't breathe…    Can you not choke me like that? I mean it.    There's one more of you here.Do you work in pairs?    N-No, it's just me.    Oh, no! Sorry, my bad!    I didn't mean to hurt you.    Little punk!    My nose grows on its own.    It's a reflex thing!    When I lie, my nose grows.    Sorry, I lied just now.    I mean, it wasn't totally a lie.    Well, I don't work in a pair,but I'm not exactly alone either.    That's right.    Oh, see that? I was telling the truth.    My nose shrank back!    -Ouch.-What the hell are you?    Please don't be so rough.    I'm speaking for myself here,but I'm a good guy.    I'm a friend to all little children.    When you were a boy,I was your friend too.    Speaking of friends,the seven are hiding close by.    I saw three of the seven earlier.See that?    A half-eaten apple.    Weather, what the hell are they?    This apple's not poisoned.    It's safe to eat.    You know who bit into a poison apple?Snow White.    The bite she took is justlodged in her throat.    She didn't digest the thing.    Who eats an applefrom a random old lady, anyway?    We're even wary aboutValentine's day chocolates.    She's so naive!It makes us want to protect her.    How many are there on this truck?There's so many of them, Weather!    Calm down. There's no need to panic.    What did you like as a child?Did you have a favorite character?    I bet it was me.    I'm a fan of the T-     seriesfrom The Terminator,    not that it's with us.    We love Chewbacca.    Not to mention The Elephant Man!    But Snow White is the best of all!    -Heigh-ho!-Heigh-ho!    People like to speculatewhether we're involved,    but we and Snow White havea purely platonic friendship!    -Yeah!-Yeah!    These vermin…    That means they're…    I know them. I know who they are.    But what could this all mean?    Breaking news.    Today at  :   p.m.,    Batman has disappearedeverywhere in the world.    An investigation is underway,with experts looking into the possibility    of ink and print fadingcaused by chemical breakdown.    Similar incidents have been reportedfor various characters.    Hey Weather! Is that what it is?    They came straight out of stories?But why?    Who's your favorite? Is it me?    Sorry, but I don't know any of you.    Now scram, unless you want meto kick you to death.    Weather, I had that book first.    Put that apple down.    The book too!    Where are you, Anasui?    Anasui?    Where did you go?    Old man, stop the car!    -What?-What's wrong, Weather?    I said, hit the brakes!    Oh good heavens.    -How sickening!-This is terrible! Everyone, come look!    Old man, stop! Stop the car!    What? What is it, Weather?    Weather! What's happening?    That man under the truck!    That face! How did I fall?How did I get there?    You split.    You were my fan, weren't you?    Way back when you were little.    sh*t!    I'll get run over by the tires!    Weather, get him to stop the car!    This can't be happening.    sh*t, we won't make it!    Weather Report made airbags.    Are you hurt?How did you fall out like that?    It must have been a Stand att*ck,    but I wonder why it only targeted you.    Maybe it's gotsomething to do with the fact    that I don't recognize Pinocchio.    Hey Weather!    Am I invisible to you?    Is that me on the ground?    Are you all safe?    -Woo-hoo!-Woo-hoo!    Where's the princess?    Is she okay?    She got thrown towards the burger shop.Let's go get her!    Look up! Do you recognize them?    I know of them! But we aren't friends.    They're Japanese!So sleek! Such show-offs!    Fictional characters are broughtinto the real world.    Not only that,    they have the ability tosplit our minds from our bodies.    That's what this is all about, isn't it!    If you're a Stand,tell me where your User is!    I don't know.    I really don't know a thing.    I'm just Pinocchio.    But who cares?    You can be a hero in a fantasy.    Isn't it wonderful?    Your mind split off becauseit wants to be a part of our world.    A world where everyone longs to be,    Bohemian Rhapsody.    It's a capriccio of the free!    Cut the nonsense, or else,this is what you'll get.    What are you doing?How could you do this to me?    All children around the worldare my friends!    This is not how the story goes!    Weather is gone.    I need to stay with himand my body right now.    Please wait.    Don't go.    Sorry, old man. That crash was on you.I'm taking off.    Hold on, I can't hear you.    I have quite a hairy ear.    Come closer.    You need to sit tight.    Onlookers will gather any minuteand will call an ambulance.    Did you hurt your finger?Your nail is split.    No, these hands are    for giving you a big, warm hugas a thank you for saving me.    Your pants are ripped.Something's sticking out of it.    It's a duster.    Let me repay you by dusting you off.    Is everything okay?Your mouth is split to your ears.    Yes, it's to swallow you whole,Little Red Riding Hood!    Diver Down!    And that's how the story goes.    Did he just say "story"?    Weather!    Pinocchio and the dwarvesdidn't seem to be Stands.    The User and the Standare in separate places,    bringing the characters to life.    To the north. I feel the presence.    The User and its Stand are not far away.    Pinocchio is only the start.    We must get rid of the User.    Weather!    Can't you hear me?

I can feel it moving farther away.  If it wanted to att*ck us,  its presence should beapproaching us instead.  What is going on?  There's my body!   The enemy first wants to k*ll my body,which is vulnerable without my Stand.   I have to protect my body!   What's this?   Oh! It's Batman!   I found Batman! Awesome!

Did they just say "story?"   How could you be so cruel?   How could youdevour my brothers like that?   What is this creature?   I thought that was chocolateI injected into my face.   Are they goats, or are they chocolate?   "He's a cunning little devil."   "He tricked the seven kidsinto opening the door and came inside."   "And then, he cornered the kidsone by one and gobbled them up!"   "The only one that survived   was the youngest kid,who hid inside the grandfather clock!"   I know this story!   "When the mother goat came home,she grew very upset!"   "The mother held the scissorsin her cloven hoof,   and went a one, a two at his stomach."   "She took out his guts andstuffed pebbles in his body."   "Then he got thrown into a pond!"   Don't read such a story!   The villain was a wolf!   The wolf came and ate my brothers!   The enemy Stand wasn't goingafter my body.   I was being dragged into   a story!   Excuse me.   Is this the way tothe hospital in Saint-Rémy?   Ask someone else.   Oh? Excuse me.

Continuing reporton the fantasy hero incident.    The incident is believed to havestarted in Florida, USA, a few hours ago.    Not only are cartoonand story characters brought to life,    but even figures from artworksare being sighted.    The riches of all humanity,    the treasures for our souls    are vanishing!    This User doesn't care aboutcausing chaos around the world.    Their only objectiveis to keep the priest safe.    The Stand itself is invincible.    The only way to win is to strike the User!    The User is headed north. I can sense it.    It's moving at a pretty fast pace.    It's getting farther away from here!    Here's a question.    How many self-portraits did I paint,    before my untimely death?    Back off, or I'll kick you!    The answer is about   .    Van Gogh left that many self-portraits.    It was before I cut off an ear.    Then I ended my    years of life,    k*lling myself with a g*n!    I see you are one of my self-portraits.    Hello, Van Gogh with a severed ear.    What?    Van Gogh sh*t himself in the head twice.    A single b*llet wasn't enoughto end his life.    That's right. He needed to sh**t himselftwice to seal the deal.    This enemy!    Weather Report!    Direction is north.    Shut down the highway with a rainstorm,up to    kilometers north!    Don't let a single car head north!    Diver Down restructured the doorfrom the inside.    It's been fused with the wall.Nothing can open this door now!    Diver Down!    My brothers are free!    And that's how the story goes!    Once a story begins,nothing can alter its course.    I'm powerless against this Stand!    The walls, Diver Down!    Submerge!    Hell yes, I'm safe.    Officers from earlier.    So their souls have also splitfrom their bodies.    Anyhow, I'm taking this police car…    -Pebbles! Get the pebbles!-Mommy!    I can't escape.Weather, hurry and k*ll the User!    I sensed the enemy up north,    but now it's down south.    No way…    Is it in the air?    Flight     , destination Key West.    Despite the sudden downpour,    we were able to depart on time.    This ability that recently awakenedwithin me.    I can only be defeated ifI'm in direct harm's way    Nothing can touch me whenI'm high up in the air.    I'm finally living my life to the fullest.    This power keeps my blood racing.

Those who were drawn to me.    They exist to bring me to heavenwhen the rightful time arrives.    Yes, Jolyne Cujoh may have escapedto chase me down,    but she merely existsto help me attain heaven.    Sons of Dio,    help me get to Cape Canaveral.    This act will beyour singular source of joy.    All my life,    I felt like a tumbling rockthat rolls without a purpose.    But now I understand.    I was born to use my ability!    I'll do whatever it takesto protect the priest.    Also, Bohemian Rhapsody is magnificent!    It makes me laugh to watchsociety fall into utter darkness.    The very society that despised me!    No, I can't catch up.    If the Stand User is on an airplane,    its speed exceeds    kph.    Even the largest hurricane on record    cannot travel faster than    kph.    There's not a single weather phenomenonthat can catch up to an airplane.    It got away!    One more b*llet.    If I take one more b*llet,    this story will end.    Dammit!    Don't you dare get close to that g*n.    If you touch it, I'll k*ll you!    Anasui!    Weather.    What?    Weather!    Yes! The wolf is drowned!    -And that's how the story goes!-Hurray!

This includes Mona Lisa, Snow White,Batman, and Tweety.    However, for some unknown reason,Pinocchio is still missing.    Did you fall asleep?    Was it too boring?    But this story is fullof hopes and dreams.    UNGALOSTAND NAME: Bohemian Rhapsody    BACK TO DESPAIRBEYOND RECOVERY    Hey, what do you drive now?    I hope    you got rid of that one, Romeo.    Jolyne!    Please. Help me, Jolyne!    -Do you know what a "plea deal" is?-…you will be sent to Green Dolphin…    Romeo!    You…    How did you…    Let me warn you, Romeo.    Stay away from the phone.    All phones.    Got that?    That's the last thing on my mind.    Ever since that day, I've felt so sorry.    I realized my own foolishness    only after I lost you.    Oh, god.    How can I ever make upfor what I've done to you--    There's no need for words, Romeo.    You are the best I ever had.    I need you.    I tried to go visit you,but they wouldn't let me.    Romeo, you poor boy.    I really pity you.    Nothing matters anymore    about the hit-and-run.    I have nothing against you.    After all, you got embroiledin a conspiracy.    Romeo, I came to ask you for a favor.    I need money and a car.    I have to go somewhere.    I only have a thousand dollars on me.    Take these keys.    This is plenty. Thank you, Romeo.    Just don't talk if the police come.    Promise me.    Oh, Jolyne,    I will confess my crimes.    I'll get you a non-guilty verdict.    So please, come back to me!    Wow, car keys!    Hello? I'm Romeo Jisso,a Palm Beach resident.    Is this the police?    I'm reporting an escaped convict.    Yes, it's Jolyne Cujoh.    I knew it.    It was wise that you used my stickerto make a copy of his tongue.    This assh*le is already ratting you out.    No, she didn't!    She didn't come to my house.Why would she?    I'm filing a report because she called.    Yes, we only talked over the phone.    She asked for moneybut I didn't give her any.    She said she's headed to Mexico.    Of course, I will make another callif she contacts me again.    Yes. Bye.    I'm impressed.    He kept his word.    I will do anything for her.    Anything to atone for my actions.    Jolyne!    Wow, your ex-boyfriend is awesome!    Guess what the key is for?    He gave us car keys too, but guess what?    Look over there!    Can we ride it?    I want to try piloting it.    I bet it's totally differentfrom reading about it in a book!    Romeo, I stand corrected.    But let's rip this off. For good measure.    Let's get going.    The helicopter will get us therein a matter of hours.    Father,    I understand my assignment to protect you.    Can you do somethingabout my eyelid first?    One of my eyelids    always slides down for no reason.    I can't open my eye.    I mean, I can get it to open sometimes.
05x27 - Sky HighQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:36Wow, so this is auto-pilot mode.I'm getting the hang of it.  Don't get carried away.Didn't you read that helicopters crash?  Emporio, head west. We need to go west.  Why? At this rate, we'll bein Cape Canaveral in    minutes.  It's the priest's presence.  For some reason,it's now in three to four locations.  It's just west.  I have no doubt thathe is close to Orlando.  -I feel strange.-What?   Ermes, my eye feels weird.   My eyelids! They're closing!   Jolyne, something is off!   What?   My eyelids!   My eyes won't open!   What's going on, Ermes?   What is happening?   I don't know!   But something else is here!   Dammit…   EPISODE   : Sky High   Emporio, control the helicopter!   I'm trying to put it back in auto-pilot!   We're under att*ck.   What did it do to us?   Hurry! We're tilting down to the right!   I can't see anything!My eyelids won't budge!   There's definitely something in here!   Are you sure?My web of strings can't detect it.   Yeah! It slid in through the window.   It moves quickly so I didn't notice.   sh*t. Its speed wouldn't be a problemif we can figure out its position!   Can you get rid of itif we learn its position?   If we knew its direction of speed?   Yeah, I'm certain of it.   All right.   Ermes,   how fast are we going right now?   Is it    kph? Or    kph?   What?   We're ditching this ride. Emporio!   What?   You're crazy, Jolyne!   We won't survive this height!   I can see it now!Yes, I can read where it is!   I got it! I smashed it!   That wasn't the only one!   Ermes, we can't drop any lower. Hang on!   Emporio, are you okay?   I can open my eyes.   I can see again.   What happened?   Don't let your guard down.They're not through with us.   There were dozens of them!   Also, they're not Stands.They're living organisms!   What are these things?   So the enemy Stand Usercan control these creatures?   Wait, I've seen it somewhere.   Until now,   I couldn't even drive a car.   But recently, I'm learning to focus.   I have enough focus to sh**t downa helicopter out of the air.   I have no doubt.   He is one of the presences I sensed.   You must be the priest's ally.   Rikiel,   think of the man named Dio.   ORLANDO STATE HOSPITAL   Think of your bloodline,   sons who have never known your father.   Both of my eyelids   close shut out of the blue.   I always get like this.   I went to the doctor,   but there's nothingphysically wrong with me.   That's all they ever say.   I was    when it started.   I was taking my end-of-year exam.   Suddenly, I couldn't breathe.   The people around me   either pitied or ignored me.   That made me sweat even more.   That was the last time I went to school.   I can't see! My eyelids! I can't breathe!   Goodness, my hands and foreheadare covered in sweat!   This happens when I get overwhelmed.   Rikiel.   I don't have an ability!   I'm a good-for-nothing!   But you do. I see it in you.   You happened to never come around to it.   Have you heard of creatures called "rods"?   They are also known as "skyfish."   They are cryptids.   Not much is known about them,and their corpses are rarely found.   TV crews have attemptedto capture them in the past,   but failed due to their insane speed.   They're too fast for the naked eye,   thus have only been seen on video footage.    I looked into your ability disc.    I found out that these rods    have a habitat here in Florida.    Are you talking about them, Father?    I saw them. Just now!    My eyes are open!    Can I control these creatures,and that's my ability?    Did one of them touch me just now?    No, it didn't. However…    Rods were around me all this time.    Now get going, Rikiel.    Starting today, your Stand abilityshall be known as Sky High.    Learn about the rods' mechanisms    and use them to your advantage.    Leave it to me. I feel like I'm reborn.    I'm no longer a mutt panting for air.    "Rods"?    Yeah. If these are rods,    we can unravel its mechanismby finding out their sustenance.    No one knows what they feed on.    Rods are able to fly aroundwithout colliding into objects.    The secret lies in their sustenance!    Emporio, stay back.    Come closer,    Jolyne Cujoh and Ermes.    For the rods' att*ckto deal precise damage,    I'll just wait for them to close in…    Hey, don't get too close to him.    We have to learn moreabout his ability first.    He was willing to expose himself    because the closer he is,the more precise his att*cks are.    He also chose a confined spacelike the helicopter,    because att*cks in an open fieldwon't be precise.    Calm down.    The range of their Standsis less than two meters.    They can't strikeunless they're close, either.     Dammit!    I parked my bike on mud.    I have to rev it up andmove it to more solid ground.    Where's my key? Where'd I put it?    The rocks made a curve!    He didn't even try to deflect the throw!    Yeah, I have no idea how that happened.    But Emporio,    the rocks didn't change their course.    One more!    I can't breathe!    My eyelid, it's twitching!    There they are, Ermes.I can see them clearly.    They're flying all around!    The rods are suspended in air!    He's having a panic att*ck    and is losing control over his ability!    Turns out you're hereto get a good b*ating!    There it is! I never took the key out!    My hand!    It was July     .    Neil Armstrong made historyas the first man to walk on the moon    on the Apollo    mission.    I never understood its significance.    It's engineers and scientistswho fly rockets to space.    Even monkeys can become astronauts.    But the first timeI fully caught sight of rods,    it finally dawned on me.    The first step on the moonwas made by humanity's willpower.    On that same day,humanity left the earth and evolved.    Mental evolution is invaluable!    My hand! It's rotting away!    It's bloody! My pee is bloody!    I can't feel my legs!    What the hell did you do?    You choose to stand in the wayof the priest's evolution.    My hatred burns hotter than tempered iron,    and I choose to eliminate you all!    STAND NAME: Sky HighSTAND MASTER: RIKIEL    Jolyne Cujoh.    You're next,but I'll finish you all at once.    He targets the inside of our bodies.    Unless the att*ck is internal,    a physical blow wouldn'ttwist her up like that.    The inside of our bodies?    This imprint!    I'm starting to understand.    Jolyne, our body heat!    Rods feed on our body heat!    Bloody urine is caused by kidney damage.    Jotaro's disc kept one kidney safe,    but the other side is cool to touchfrom losing body heat!    When I was at the ghost room,    I read something from a bookon the second row of the shelf.    A damaged body part    is colder than the rest of the body.    If your hand is robbed of heat,    the fingers curl and eventually rot.    Chill the eyelids and they droop.    Chill just one kidney,    and blood enters the urine stream.    The rods,    they convert body heat from othersinto their own energy!    They come close, but they never touch.    You don't realize what they've done,    until an illness takes a toll on you.    You little know-it-all.    He's right,    but I don't cause the illness to k*ll you.    I only meant to immobilize.    To strike you on a specific body part,that is!    Cooling this certain body part is fatal.    The body part which controlseach and every organism.    It's the brain stem!    I will now steal your body heatfrom your first vertebra.    Now, strike!    Jolyne, the water!Get your head under water.    No, Emporio. Give me your lighter.    The ghost lighter.    Give it to me.    This is too reckless!    This is nothing    compared to everything elsewe've been through.    Compared to finding that priest,    this is nothing.    This bitch!    I'm mentally stronger than her.    Where?    Find it,    find a target to finish her off!    -What the…-She got him!    A star-shaped birthmark.    I don't know who you are,    but I guess you can tell usabout the priest.    After we give you a good b*ating, that is.    Think of your bloodline.    That's right, I've changed.    No.    Rods cannot focus on one body part    when the target is covered in flames.    But if I'm also covered in flames,    I would know exactly.    I can find your vulnerable spot    through my own senses.    My heart soars like Apollo   .    Jolyne Cujoh, I will surpass you!    Jolyne, hurry up and finish him!    What are you doing?    He's behind you!    You can't see me now, can you?    I found your weaknessby setting myself on fire.    It's the mouth, left open to breathe!    The thalamus is a relay stationfor all sensory information.    It sits above the upper jaw in your mouth.    Rods enter through your mouth    and rob your body heat away.    The rods targeted your thalamus.    Your eyes can't register me anymore!    Victory is mine!I won't have any more panic att*cks.    I will reclaim my life!    I am Apollo   !    I don't need my sight.    The rods are targeting my mouth?    Then I won't breathe either.    Rikiel first came after the helicopter.    Just as I sensedThe Green Baby's position,    and just as the priest sensedthat I've broken out…    I will ask what you are.    Next, I will ask    what the priest is planning.    Her resolve is stronger than ever before.    Jolyne's determined to reach the priest.    She inherited the convictionfrom her father Jotaro Kujo.    Is this the same Jolynewho used to cry over nothing?    You won.    But it is I, Rikiel, who will helpthe priest get to Heaven.    Rods have already infected my body.    The nerves in my head and bodyhave been cut off.    I'm now numb to any pain or shock.    I will fight until I die.    Take my life in exchange for yours.    Will you defeat me first?    Or will the rods rob your body heat first?    My palm extinguished the flamecovering your first vertebra!    I'll k*ll you!    Get her, rods!    Jolyne!    Jolyne!    Jolyne!    What is this?    sh*t.    I intentionally subdued the firecovering her neck    so that the rods can rob her body heat.    My hand… dammit.    My hand is numb.    My fingers    kept her neck safe!    f*ck.    -Jolyne!-Jolyne won!    Did you mean to keep my hand on your neckbefore you b*at me down?    Or was it all a coincidence?    It was a fluke.    I was desperate.    An answer I hoped for. How kind.    Do you mean it?    What are you?    Why did you go to the priest?    Listen. I'm content right now.    Before, I couldn't even ride a car.    Now, I can breathe just fine.    The priest filled a hole in my heart.    That's why I gave up my life for him.    Running through the priest's veins    is the conviction of a man named Dio.    Dio's will draws the sons to the priest.    We are merely pawns of fatewho help the priest reach heaven.    Jolyne Cujoh,    you are no exception.    You reaching Cape Canaveralwill only serve the priest's purpose.    I now understand.    You said so yourself,it was a coincidence.    You didn't mean for my handto stay on your neck.    Nothing but luck.    It doesn't matter whether I win or lose.    I understand now.    The priest needs your luck.    Coincidences that tilt in your favor.    That is what he wishes for!    You have the strongest fateout of anyone else.    Is it me?    Or is it you?    The priest needs the onewith the stronger fate.    The strongest power of this universe    isn't attained through calculations.    Fate gathers and takes shape.    That man also has a unique fate.    That is why the priest extractedonly his memory    and kept him alive all this time.    Weather Report.    If that man breaks free,    then it's not to help your cause.    He will carry his powerful fateto the priest.    When a new star-shaped birthmarkemerged on Father Pucchi,    the same must have appearedon Weather's shoulder.    He is the priest's younger brother.    Don't waste your time listeningto his nonsense.    My sister was k*lled    by Sports Maximum,who revived Dio's bones.    Was that also for fate's sake? Bullshit.    The priest existsso that I can b*at him to a pulp.    Let's go to Orlando.    We need to go find the priest.    Was it really a coincidence thatJolyne didn't move Rikiel's hand?    Or was it intentional?    Jolyne didn't say a worduntil the very end.

05x28 - Heaven is at Hand: Three Days Until the New MoonQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:37Ermes,  how fast are we going right now?  Is it    kph? Or    kph?  What?  We're ditching this ride. Emporio!  But the first timeI fully caught sight of rods,  it finally dawned on me.  The first step on the moonwas made by humanity's willpower.  On that same day,humanity left the Earth and evolved.   Mental evolution is invaluable!   This is nothing   compared to everything elsewe've been through.   Compared to finding that priest,   this is nothing.   This bitch!   I'm mentally stronger than her.   I'll k*ll you!   f*ck.   -Jolyne!-Jolyne won!   That is why the priest extractedonly his memory   and kept him alive all this time.   Weather Report.   He is the priest's younger brother.   Let's go to Orlando.   We need to go find the priest.   EPISODE   : HEAVEN IS AT HAND:THREE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON   GREEN DOLPHIN STREET PRISON   ESCAPED FROM HELICOPTER   ORLANDO   CAPE CANAVERALSPACE CENTER   ORLANDO, FLORIDA   HOURS BY CAR TO CAPE CANAVERAL   Hurry! Prepare Emergency Room  !   Male, eight years old.He's in critical condition.   My baby, Mike!   He will be okay. Everything will be fine.   Hey, Jolyne.   This is an urgent care facility.   Is the priest really hiding here?   He's here.   I have no doubt.   I don't know why he's here,   but this is where we'll settle the score.   THREE MORE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON   Emporio.   Can you do me a favor?   I want you to deliver my father's disc,which you've kept safe for us.   Call this number,and the Speedwagon Foundation will come.   I'm going inside with you.   Of course you are,but I want you to deliver the disc first.   The priest must know thatI'm closing in on him.   I don't want to be apart from you,   but this is important.   Hold onto this phone we took from Rikiel.   Sorry to bother,but I'd like your opinion.   It concerns this meal.   I want you to try it,if only for a single bite.   Versus.   Try a bite.   Tell me the ingredients.   I can't eat shellfish.   I'm very allergic to them.   This is whitefish.   Flounder, to be more precise.   It also contains sliced asparagus.   The asparagus is incorporatedinto some ground crabmeat.   It is then steamed like a flan.   There's no shellfish in it.   Excellent.   I'm not done.   Could I have another bite with the sauce?   I smell something in the sauce.   It may contain ground scallops   mixed in with whipping cream.   Unfortunately, it's just as I thought.There's shellfish in this sauce.   So your shoe size is   cm?   Will you stand up for me?   Take your time so that the g*nsh*t woundon your leg won't open up.   Height,    cm.   Weight,   kg even.   Size,   .   Watch size is two holes up.   Correct.   Interesting.   Though I won't be able to enjoy this dish,   you were able to discernthe scallop in the sauce.   We share a similar sense of taste.   Interesting indeed.   Father Pucchi,   what are you hinting at?   I haven't seen my ability yet,   while our enemy draws near by the second.   I want to serve you.   What should I do?   This can't be helped.   That in itself is not a problem.   -Mike…-Are you okay?   He's really close.   He's around here.   You haven't seen your ability,but that can't be helped.    Let the power take its course,and do not try to resist.    Because reaching heaven    means having these factors on our side.    Jolyne may very well forgetto check this room.    Anyway, I ordered this item becauseit's supposed to be shellfish-free.    Feel free to eat it.    Father Pucchi.    I… was…    I was…    I was sh*t.    The ambulance was fun.    But my dad hates me.    My dad is the one…    who sh*t me!    Honey? Honey!    Honey!    He got sh*t!    Honey, no!    This room doesn't look right.    Where is the priest?    What is happening?    This situation…    I've no doubt it's the doingof his new ally.    But this doesn't seem likea Stand ability.    He was sh*t by a real b*llet.    And who is he?    Who is this man?    Why was he sh*t?    He's an ordinary citizen!    Evacuate everyone on this floor. Hurry!    Y-yes sir.    You two over there, evacuate!    I'll call the police.    I know, the man who got sh*t!    They were the parents of that boy    who rushed here in an ambulance!    It might be a test sh*t…    I don't know what the ability is about,    but it could be a newly awakened ability.    If so, the user would wantto know what it is    by testing it out.    What's this?    They're on the move.    The priest is on the run!    He's inside this hole.    I can sense him moving away.    Listen Jolyne.    Don't you dare go down that hole.    Got that? I won't allow it.    This is obviously a trap!    We need to find out the connectionbetween this hole and the sh**ting.    Until then, stay away from this hole!    The hole goes sidewaysto the hospital courtyard.    I can't see any further.    The enemy that's with the priest…    His name is Versus.Twenty-five years old, male.    Listen, Jolyne.    I'll say this again.We won't go down this hole.    We'll either wait for them to come out    or chase them out like rabbits.    Yes, this hole is an obvious trap.    But what if the priest    waits three more days in this hole,until the new moon rises?    Yes, the priest would do just that.    He may even use this holeto reach Cape Canaveral.    In three days,the priest will attain the power    that he calls "reaching heaven."    As of now, the priest's ability is limited    to Pale Snake, which manipulates memories.    We can still win.    This is our only chance to stop him.    We'll put him out of commission,    or if things turn bleak,we may even have to k*ll him.    Hold on to this.    Don't ever let go.    Hey, Jolyne!    What are you doing? I'm coming with you!    If you come with me,then who's going to pull me out?    Wrap my thread around your body.    I'll send a signal if I'm in danger.    In that case,do whatever it takes to pull me up.    This is crazy. It's Jolyne's thread.    How far can she actually gowhile emitting this from her body?    Jolyne?    Jolyne!    Why won't you answer me?    Jolyne!    This place…    STAND NAME: UnderworldSTAND MASTER: DONATELLO VERSUS    This place…        ?    What's going on?    Look, it's her.    She's tied to her thread.    I'll go cut it.    What is this place?    Ermes, it's not looking good.Can you hear me?    Pull me up!    Hurry, Ermes! This is bad.    Get me out of here. They'll cut my thread!    Ermes, what's taking you so long?    Hurry, Ermes!    Pull me up!    Ermes!    You should be able to hear me!    Dammit, what's going on in there?    She hasn't gone too deep.    Ermes, faster!    Pull me up with all your strength!    I welcome you here,even with your outside shoes on,    and even if you didn't greet me.    You may enter my hole as you wish.    However, make sure to bringall of this tightened rope with you.    Stone Ocean!    Hey Versus, are you hurt?    Unlike you, who justawakened to a Stand ability,    Jolyne Cujoh has become an adept fighterat The Green Dolphin.    You could say she's a hardened fighter.    She won't hesitate to nick a penfrom a passenger.    Don't bother with Jolyne.    You've done excellently, Versus.    If Jolyne wants out, let her leave.    She won't try to set footin this hole a second time.    For the next three days,we will bide our time in this hole.    That will do.    Can you hear me, Ermes? I see the light!    I'm close to the exit. Pull me up!    I can hear you, Jolyne!    I caught a glimpse of you just now.Are you hurt?    What did you find down there?    The enemy is looking up at me from below.    But I also saw the priest down here.    We have to think of other waysto enter this hole.    I would've been deadif they cut off my thread.    Now talk to me, will you?    Huh, Ermes?    How do you feel right now?    You buried me alivein a prison sewage pipe.    How did it feel whenyou finally avenged your sister?    Sports Maximum!    What's going on, Ermes? Get it together!    Jolyne!    The Earth records the past.    It's like a magnetic tape,    or a digital camera.    It remembers the little boy    who fell to the groundafter being sh*t by his father.    Where the hell did you come from?    It remembers a gangsterwho was buried alive in a pipe.    It also remembers every detailof July     , seven years ago,    when a commercial flight crashedinto the ground.    Ermes, what're you doing up there?    Ermes!    Let go, jerk!    This is Versus's ability.    Underworld excavates.    It unearths memories!    Fucker!    Jolyne!    Attention all passengers.    It is July   ,     ,and time to destination is   :  .    This aircraft will crash to the ground.    Please turn off all electronic devices,    and fasten your seatbeltat your lower waist.    Also, the face of the passenger seatedat the rear gets lodged in my stomach,    by the crash impact.    What's going on?    Dammit, where is it?    Search for the exit, Ermes.    What is this place? Is this an illusion?    It was on the ceiling earlier.Find the hole where we came from.    The walls feel just as hardas the inside of a real plane.    We have to find the exit!    Did anyone come to the hospital room?    There was commotionover the little boy's father,    so the police should've come.    Didn't you see them?    I don't know, but even if they're there,    I couldn't hear you outside the hole.    Are we in a commercial plane?    I didn't see anything like thisfrom above!    Please do not punch the ceiling.    Please sit and wait quietly.    We will crash in less than three minutes.    I want to speak with the pilot.    Have him land the plane immediately.    Take us to the cockpit!    It's no use.    We couldn't make an emergency landing.    That's why we crashed.    What's wrong with her?    We all b*rned to death.    When the plane crashed,    there was an expl*si*n.    My body…    Excuse me, I asked you to turn offyour electronic devices.    This can't be.I remember hearing about this incident.    Flight     , en route to Dallas.    This plane crashed close to Orlandosix or seven years ago.    Are they ghosts…    We're memories,merely the facts of the event    recorded by the Earth.    Are we seriously about to crash?    Can't you speed up the crash?    I've been feelingWeather Report's presence.    They are really close to this hospital.    Cut the chatter. You confuse me.    Are you talking to me?    Underworld unearths memories.    The time of the crash was set at   :  .    And please don't forget    that I managed to drag Ermes along.    I did it all for you.    Leave this to me.    TWO MINUTES UNTIL CRASH
05x29 - Under WorldQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:38Keep going.  -Back!-Which one are you talking about, Weather?  Is it Jolyne, who you thinkis already near the hospital?  Or… do you mean the priest is nearby?  No, it's all three, Anasui.  Jolyne, the priest, and another enemy.  I feel all three of them.  Find them. Where are they?  Are they inside the building?   Attention all passengers.   It is July   ,     ,and time to destination is   :  .   This aircraft will crash to the ground.   TWO MINUTES UNTIL CRASH   What the hell are you doing?   Why are you messing with that door?   We can't find the exit on the ceiling.   The fastest way to get outis to defeat the Stand User.   Ermes, hold onto my thread again.   Grab onto to a fixture.   You, flight attendant,   go change the door to manual mode.   What? Hold on.   Isn't it dangerous to openthe door mid-flight?   Doesn't the air pressure…   No.   Go!   She's riding the airflowto strike the User!   Mayday!   Took a hit from a MiG.   Lost control of the aircraft.   This is coming to a close fast.   Who are you?   Doesn't matter.Looks like the back seat was compromised.   Check the damage for me, will you?   What's this?   f*ck!   Jolyne!   Stone Ocean!   McCoy on the line.   We just arrived at the scene.   This is incomprehensible,but there's a hole in a patient's room.   Its depth is unknown.   Jolyne Cujoh learned how to fightin prison.   She foresaw thather launched att*ck would fail.   She left the plane for the walkie-talkie.   She waited for the policeto arrive at the scene.   She knew the officers would bring radios.   She will call her ally now.   The frequency on those talkiescan be adjusted to dial cell phones.   Can't you just shut up for a moment?   Does it look like I'm losing?   Tell me, Father. Who's winning?   I grew up not knowing who my father was.   I got sick of my mother and stepfatherwho doted on my stepsisters,   so I ran away from home.   I was   .   I meant to be gone for a few days,   and I was wandering around,looking for a place to sleep.   Just then, a pair of spikesfell from the skies.   They were baseball spikes.   They smelled very nice.   Did someone toss them from a roof?   It made no sense.The spikes were brand new.   They were sized   . cm.   They were too big for my feet,   but I liked the satisfying soundsthey made.   I walked down the street cheerfully.   That's when the cops pulled overand arrested me.   This is not a trial.   We have questions for you.   Okay?   Did you steal them?   The shoes were signedby the baseball player Ichiro.   The pair was originally donatedto children with disabilities.   The collectors would payup to   ,    dollars for them.   The theft was all over the news.   I told her the truth.   They fell from the sky.   You should be ashamed of yourself,stealing from children with disabilities!   Go reflect on your actionsin juvenile detention!   This judge sent me to juvenile detentionbased solely on circumstantial evidence!   My parents did not appeal the case.   Four months later,   the actual thief confessed.   He feared Ichiro's spikeswould get traced.   So he tossed themdown a ventilation shaft,   and somehow the spikes fell onto my head.   By the time my innocence was proven,   my body and soul was already hurt.   I couldn't even walk straight.   Somehow, there was a holein the facility courtyard.   I tripped on it and fell.   There was a Kn*fe inside a plastic bagburied in the ground.   I stabbed my hand on it.   You've done it now.   I was hiding that Kn*fe, dammit.   The next day, a g*ng henchmanwho was three years older than I,   b*at the life out of me.   A doctor treated my wounds.    Yet two weeks later,    bloody pus and a worm gushed out.    I also almost d*ed from a terrible fever.    Since that day,    I hid from societyand started to live a tiresome life.    One time, I pissed next to a trash bin.    The walls crumbled down,    and a woman's skull showed itselffrom the walls.    And now,    I finally understandthe cause of my bizarre life.    It was my ability, Underworld!    Yes, at last,my ability is under control,     but does this meanI'm indebted to Father Pucchi?    No.    My father Dio's bloodruns through my veins.    Father Pucchi,    what makes you so much better than me?    I can throw you into that plane.    I haven't had a single slip-up.Not even one!    He rams through with his decisions,just like that old hag of a judge.    I'm getting really pissed at him.    I, Versus, am invincible.    Nothing is impossible with Underworld!    What makes him so special?    What if I present myself instead of himon the new moon?    Can I inherit the powerDio hoped to obtain?    I have the right too.    I'm Dio's son!    It's Weather Report's memory disc.    How can I use this to my advantage?    I want the power to go to heaven.    Jolyne!    Emporio, pick up the phone!    Emporio!    Hey you!Tell me the model of this fighter jet!    How do I eject?    The seat must be able to eject somehow!    I've seen it in movies.    Tell me how to eject the seat!    There's an ejection lever on the seat.    But I didn't eject, you see.    This jet crashed to the groundbefore I could escape.    Those are the facts.    No one can escape this aircraft.    Pulling the lever won't do a thing.    What's wrong, Jolyne?    It hasn't been that long.    Emporio!    I'm inside a hole at the hospital.    Ermes is on a commercial planethat crashed years ago.    I'm on a fighter jet.We're about to crash!    Search for ways to help us!    What?    Father Pucchi,    do you have any use for Jolyne's body?    The fighter jet pilot's bodywas never fully recovered.    The impact obliterated him.    Hello? Jolyne, take a deep breath.    I can't tell what's going on.    I'll head back to the hospital now.    No, Emporio.    I'm stuck in the memory of the past!    We can't change the crash.    My survival depends on getting out,but I can't eject!    No, we're out of time.    There's less than a minute left.    The fighter jet will crashbefore this plane!    You flew the fighter jet into…    You're right, Emporio.    It didn't explode, Emporio.    I rammed it into the commercial plane,but it didn't explode!    Of course, it didn't.    The fact is that the planes crashed.    So the planes will eventually crash.    Until then, they won't explodeno matter what you do.    -Jolyne!-I'm back!    Emporio, what should I do next?    Let me see.    It's Flight      to Dallas,a crash incident from six years ago.    Miraculously, two passengers survived.    I'm looking it up on my ghost computer.    Go find those two seats!    You may not be able to leave the aircraft,    but the ability runsthe exact course of events.    You can survive by sitting in those seats.    Emporio, hurry and find outthe seat numbers!    That's Jolyne Cujoh.    She forges her own paths.    Do you still thinkyou can finish her off, Versus?    Shut up!    Who does he think he is?    Found it, Jolyne!    A newspaper article publishedthe seat numbers of the two survivors.    They're Economy class,   D and   F.    It's at the very rear.    It also says thatthe plane crashed at   :  .    It's all true!    Run, Jolyne!    The enemy Stand is here!    It wants to get ahead of usand destroy the seats!    Thirty-two seconds left until impact.This is a minor setback.    I only have to destroy the seats.    That's all it takesto obliterate the fact.    Ermes!    Secure the seats!    We only have to sit in those seatsand survive the crash.    Then, we can face the Stand User!    Let's make it out of this alive    and defeat the Stand User!    The seats are still intact,but their attempt is futile.    There's only    seconds left.    I'll say this again.    The only safe seats are   D and   F.    Don't sit anywhere else!    According to the article,    all other seats were destroyedin an expl*si*n on impact.    It was a fluke causedunder miraculous circumstances.    The two seats were in an air pocket.    Once you sit down, buckle up.    Guard yourselves with your Stands,or you won't survive!    Move! I'm taking this seat!    What are you doing--    Shut up and scram!    You are nothing but recorded facts.    No more than memories of survivors!    You're not the people nor their souls.    The real old man is alive and happy.    Get out of my way.Jolyne, we don't have time.    Let's buckle up--    Move, brat!    You're in our seat!    Hold on, Ermes.    Where the hell did you come from?    This isn't my room.    Where am I?    I'm supposed to take my medicationafter my nap.    You came down from the ceiling!    Don't tell me you're…    This can't be!    They're not illusions, or even passengers!    Where's the nurse?    She's a real girl!    The assh*le pushed these kidsdown the hole!    What?    No need to destroy the seats.    Jolyne Cujoh.    Don't forget to buckle up.    Go on, push them out of the wayand take a seat.    That way, you two will survive.    Physically speaking, that is.    Once you crawl out of that plane alive,    you won't be able to bear the guilt.    Guilt that you sacrificed children's livesto save your own.    Will you be able to fight mewith so much guilt on your shoulders?    You won't be so cocky then.    Underworld may not besuitable for combat,    but it can deal enough damageto finish off such guilt-ridden fools.    Jolyne? What's going on? Hello?    What's happening? Who are you talking to?    Dammit, the plane is beginning to shake!    We'll put each child in our laps.    No, we'll all die.Each seat can only fit one person!    And there are three children!    Are we in your seats?    It takes me a second to stand up.    Sorry, we'll get out of your way.You can have your seat back.    It's time. Two seconds,    one second, brace for impact.    Jolyne!    STAND NAME: KissSTAND MASTER: ERMES COSTELLO    The victory is yours, Versus.    But I saw three children.    That's one too many.    Don't you feel guilty?    No, it wasn't my fault.    I was forced to do thisbecause Jolyne called her ally.    Jolyne kept resistingby finding the survivors' seats.    Not to mention, I did this for you,    Father Pucchi.    Look, Versus.    That's Ermes's sticker.    The surviving old man.    The fact of the matter isthat the survivors didn't die.    That's Ermes's sticker.    She copied the survivors    and kept the children safeinside their bodies.    Ermes! That means…    Where is Jolyne Cujoh?    Ermes!    Ermes!    She lodged herselfin the body of the other survivor!    Dammit, Ermes!    But Jolyne is dead!    Jolyne has nowhere to turn!    If I were you,    I'd think this through more carefully.    assh*le, whose side are you on--    Jolyne unraveled her body into threadsas much as she could.    She then hid inside my body,surviving the crash.    Good grief.    Jolyne Cujoh isn't filled with guilt,    but rather coming at you,burning with wrathful justice.    What will you do now, Versus?    Underworld!    You won't be digging a hole    or excavating memories any longer.    You're finally ours,    Father Pucchi!    Can I finish off the priest?    Or should we do this together?    Unfortunately, Versus,it looks like you lost.    Jolyne Cujoh's gravitational pull to me    was much stronger than yours.    Let's finish him off, Jolyne!    This groundhog is done for!    Weather Report!    What the hell? What did he just do?    Jolyne, finish him off!    When did you take it from me?    Was it when Jolyne blasted you?    Give it back immediately.    It belongs to me.    You don't understand what you're doing.    Sorry, but I'm not going to die here,    Father Pucchi.    My ability finally awakened.    I've never had anything to live up to.    I'm finally starting to understandwhy I was born.    You don't understand anything.    His memory must stay with me,    at least for another three days.    I won't end here!    I have the right to become happy!    What are you saying?    What are you guys talking about?    Jolyne,    finish him off already!    It's too late.    You can't finish me.    He will regain his memory.    I know it because I read his memory.    He's not the ally you think he is.    Memory?    Is he talking about Weather Report?    Did he throw Weather's disc?    Weather Report is more thana convict with amnesia.    He doesn't remember how his ability works.    His brother, Father Pucchi,sealed away his demonic powers!    He is the priest's younger brother.    So Rikiel was telling the truth,they really are…    Weather Report and Father Pucchi?    So you used Underworld    to read the disc's recorded facts.    Versus!You are nothing but a thatched hut.    You have no place in the grand purposeDio and I have fought for!    He's starting to remember.    Look, he's here.    Rainbows. There are rainbows!The devil's rainbows!    It's Heavy Forecast!    Weather, what's the matter?    Where's Jolyne? Why are you crouching?    Weather, what's wrong?    What are you doing?    What's your problem, punk?    I was sitting here first.    Don't touch me, I'll k*ll you!    THREE MORE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON
05x30 - Heavy Weather (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:39Weather Report!  When did you take it from me?  Was it when Jolyne blasted you?  Give it back immediately.  It belongs to me.  You don't understand what you're doing.  He's starting to remember.  Look, he's here.  Rainbows. There are rainbows!The devil's rainbows!   It's Heavy Forecast!   Weather, what's the matter?   What are you doing?   What's your problem, punk?   I was sitting here first.   Don't touch me, I'll k*ll you!   Hey! You can't takean injured person's seat--   Stop fussing.   You want him to sit, do you?   He can sit on you then.   Weather! What are you doing?   He's not an enemy!   He's just a nurse!   Now, sit all you want, crutch guy.   I've never felt better.   Wait up!   Weather, where do you think you're going?   Weather? Don't Weather me.   So I go by Weather Report now.   Not a bad name.   What happened to him?   It's as if…   he's gained an entirely new personality!   EPISODE   : HEAVY FORECAST ( )   Rainbows!   Rainbows are closing in on us!   Jolyne, we have no time to waste!   This looks serious!   It's over!   Meet your end!   -What the hell?-Ermes?   What just happened?   -Was it an illusion?-This is bad.   Your life is in danger, but so is mine.   You untied yourself.   I'm warning you.   Don't touch those rainbows.   Those are Weather Report's rainbowsFather Pucchi sealed up!   Weather Report's Stand abilitycontrols the weather.   Do you understand what this means?   With his memory restored,he can even destroy the ozone layer.   The ozone is even higher than the sky.   What could comefrom messing with the ozone?   I can only say that it won't end well,   but we're all in danger.   The survival of humanity is at stake!   It was a risky sacrifice,   but I used Weather Reportto save my skin!   What did the ozone do to my Kiss?   Answer me. Do these rainbows meanthat Weather's memory is back?   The rainbows come outfrom his subconscious.   Weather Report's Standhas an a*t*matic att*ck.   The weather is a complex phenomenon.   His ability manifests in wayshe doesn't realize.   His memory should neverhave been returned to him.   I'll tell you this.   To stop the rainbows,you must k*ll Weather,   or extract his memory again.   Jolyne, can you k*ll Weather?   If not, then humanity may endbefore the new moon.   Though, I won't end here.   You shouldn't let Versus escape.   Versus fled, Jolyne!   There are two women here!   -Officer!-Officer!   This is…   Was the hole this shallow?   He deactivated Underworld and took off!   Where did they go?   Did you see two men running off?   Which way did they go?   Before we get to that,   I've seen your faces…   On a wanted fugitives list!   Rainbows. Just what is going on?   It's everywhere!   Hey!   What's going on?   You two!   You're the escaped convicts!   Don't go anywhere!   Get over here!   -Don't touch the rainbows!-Stay away from them!   Jolyne!   What do we do?   This is terrible!   What is going on?   Anyone who touches a rainbowsecretes snails!   I've seen Weather rain downfrogs in a storm.   But these snails are entirely different.    How does this phenomenon relateto Weather Report    and his ability to manipulate the weather?    Not only that,    once infected by the snails,people are losing their minds.     You can't run!    What is going on?    Ermes!    Jolyne! Are you okay?    Yeah.    Ermes.    Compared to normal people,Stand Users may have a tolerance    to this kind of phenomenon.    So Jolyne,    who should we target?    Who do we need to defeat?    Is Weather Report an enemy,    or do we keep going after the priest?    Tell me, who do we get rid of?    Weather Report, with his memories,is our enemy!    No! Weather Report is our ally.    He's not our enemy!    We have to find Versus.    Just like the priest said,    we can't let Versus go free.    His ability is to excavate memories.    Maybe we can unearthWeather's memory disc,    and stop this bizarre phenomenon.    I like your line of thinking.    But first,    we need to get out of this hospital!    Hey! Where are you headed, Weather?    Is that where Jolyne is?    Tell me!    sh*t.    I want it.    I want that power.    I need to get it before the priest!    The power to attain heaven.    I want to live a good life!    What should be my next course of action?    Underworld!    Found it.    The memory of the groundwhen these two arrived at the hospital.    Ermes.    Now is our chance,when we go after Father Pucchi.    So don't worry.    What?    My father's disc can be sentto the Speedwagon Foundation,    while we have Father Pucchi's attention.    Emporio will not fail.    Father will finally come back to us.    So Emporio is the ally's namewhom Jolyne was calling.    I have to find him.    It's someoneeven the priest wasn't aware of.    I don't know what Emporio looks like,    since I haven't dug up a memory of him.    But with all this commotion going on,    Jotaro Kujo's disc must still be with him.    He hasn't gotten it to this foundation.    Jotaro's disc gave the priestthe idea of getting into heaven.    If I get a hold of that disc,    even I can go to heaven!    The rainbows are my chance!    Jotaro's disc belongs to me!    These snails are multiplying so fast,they've covered the entire floor!    They won't stop reproducing!    Snails are asexual.    They pierce each other with love darts.    Both snails then give birthto dozens of baby snails!    Good grief.    They have sex with anythingthat comes their way?    I'm a bit jealous… I mean, that's creepy.    -Ermes!-Got it.    Kiss!    Stone Ocean!    No User has two Stands.    Weather Report can onlycontrol the weather.    But this is entirely different.    Just what is going on?    STAND NAME: Weather ReportSTAND MASTER: Weather Report    Back when life first began to emergein the form of plants,    oxygen began to form.    Oxygen is made up of O ,    which bonds with a third oxygen molecule.    Ozone consists of O  molecules.    The ozonosphere occursat altitudes of    kilometers    to    kilometers.    If this ozone layerwere compromised in any way,    what would become of life on Earth?    Humans cannot predictirregularities in weather patterns.    We can only analyze past weather patterns    collected over decades.    I'm going ahead!    Where is he? He has to be here.    He must be close by.    I'll find him and seize the disc,    before it's handed to that foundation!    He'll probably head to the hospital    because he won't abandon Jolyne!    The one who goes in to find Jolynemust be Emporio!    He'll be the one who's goingopposite everyone else.    Dammit! I refuse to lose!    I'm going to live a happy life!    Jolyne, I wish I could help.    But…    I have to go deliver this discto the Foundation's messenger!    I promised Jolyne to gether father's disc to the Foundation.    The Foundation rep saidto meet in five minutes!    Dammit!    What the hell?    No one is headed toward the hospital!    He has to be in the area.    I just know it!    Hello? Jolyne?    Hello?    I got you now.    Thanks, Underworld.The earth never fails me.    The memory of Jolyne had his number!    Emporio relayed the survivors'seat numbers to Jolyne    using his cell phone!    Meaning, Jolyne knows his cell number!    Who would've thoughtEmporio was a little boy?    Even the priestdidn't know about this kid.    What's this? He doesn't have the disc.    Moreover, he doesn't have hisphone either.    He had it a moment ago!    Hold on, I need to keep my head cool.    I can excavate to learnwhat he did with the disc.    I can watch him put it away!    Oh, sh*t.    It's them!    -Are you sure he came this way, Jolyne?-Yeah.    I feel his presence over here.    I'm sure I saw Emporio going this way.    Wait, do you think he's after Emporio?    Impossible.    Even the priest doesn't knowabout Emporio, so how can Versus know?    -That's…-Emporio!    Watch out! Jump!    Disgusting!    These are real, all right.    Not illusions.    So slimy and gross.    Ermes!    Jolyne, go without me.    Go find Emporio!    That was definitely him getting dragged.    I don't know how he found out,but Versus is after Emporio.    Stone Ocean!    Dammit.    My rope!    My movements are slowed to snail's pace!    Emporio!    If you can hear me, pull on my rope!Grab onto it!    Forty-five, sixty!    Hut!    Jolyne!    This is Florida.    I dug up memories about the Superbowl.    Jolyne Cujoh,    the quarterback will carry youall the way to the touchdown line.    My thread!    You are too slow to do anything.    Bye. You're too far away now.    Yikes, I shouldn't touch these snails.    I wasn't wrong.    He had Jotaro's disc just moments ago.    A second later,his disc suddenly disappears.    He must have used his Stand ability.    He's able to stash thingswith his ability.    Then where did he put the disc?    I should check again.    What?    Where's Jolyne?    She's a snail. She can't move quickly!    Unbelievable, she caught up to him.    She rolled over!    She squeezed into a streetlight polethat broke in half.    Now that her body has turned gooey,she can easily fit in a metal pole!    Underworld!    I didn't expect you to roll yourself over,    but this doesn't change a thing.    You are still powerlessagainst my Underworld!    I excavated a certain memory.    Memory of ocean waterevaporating and leaving salt!    Snails and slugs can't stand salt!    What?    sh*t, where is it?    I know you have the disc somewhere.    You've hidden it somewhere.    Where did you stash it?    I see, so our Stands work similarly.    His Stand controlsthe memories of objects.    I did it!    I found Jotaro's memory disc!    It's mine now!    I win!    And now, finally,    I'm a step closer to the heaventhat priest is after!    Jolyne!    I'm sorry, Emporio.    I used you as bait.    You touched me,    and he touched you.    Feeling the sensation… All at once…    I'm so slow!    Damn right, he's ours now!    Nice going, Jolyne!    Emporio.    It's no use.    The Speedwagon Foundation's messengercan't enter the city limits.    He's just standing by.    Is that right?    Nicely done.    You got it, carjacker.    Let me set things straight.    I've never stolen a car.    I'm messing with you.    You're coming with us.    Don't even think about running again.    I know.    What's this?    Are these the driver's shells?    But why just shells?    Shells here too.    Okay, I'm catching on.    I don't know what Weather didto transform people into snails.    But I do know what lies ahead of us.    The snails' natural enemieswhich feed on them.    Snails can only move slowly,    so they often die like this.    These beetles stick their headsinside the shells    and devour the snails!    That's why these beetles are calledsnail eaters!    These buggers!    Hey Weather!    I said wait up! Hey!    What's going on?    Did you cause this?    Weather! What have you done?    Silence, Anasui.    He is closing in on us.    He is within a   -meter radius.    Him? You mean, Father Pucchi?    He's here.    My sole purpose in life    is to settle my score with him.
05x31 - Heavy Weather (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:39June  th,     .  On a hot humid night,deep in the southern United States,  one baby let out his first cryin a hospital.  However, this baby took his last breathin his mother's arms  before even seeing the first light of day.  Until this point in her life,this young mother had a hard life,  and felt hopelessly miserable.  This baby had becomeher only pride and joy,  and her only hope for a bright future.   Thus, she refusedto accept the baby's death.   Before the doctor and the nursessaw that the baby d*ed,   the mother slipped out of her bedlike a ghost.   She found another babyborn on the same day,   and left her dead baby in its place.   She then kept the baby as her own.   The swapped baby had a fraternal twin.   She was never questioned,   and no one suspected foul play.   Mommy, whose grave is this?   That's my birthday.   He d*ed the same day?   Enrico,   you had a younger brother.   He was your twin,   but he d*ed at the hospitalmoments after you were born.   Pray for him.   After his passing,   we named him Domenic.   Oh Lord, answer my plea.   My brother passed awayon the day we were born.   Why did fate choose him and not me?   Why… must there behappiness and misfortune?   What is true happiness?   Father Pucchi was   years old at the time.   His paternal grandmotherwas an Italian immigrant.   She came from a family with tiesto a prestigious clan in Venice   which hailed a well-known clergymanin the   th century.   When the young man showed interestin pursuing priesthood,   no one spoke out against this decision.   What did you do? Who are you?   What are you doing here?   Hey!   Is this your book?   This is a famous autobiography of a clericwho had an affair with a married woman.   He later left the churchand became a painter.   Do clergymen read such books?   Who are you, and how did you get inside?   This ossuary is closed to the publicexcept on Sundays.   You see, I'm allergic to sunlight.   The sun won't set until  :   p.m. tonight.   I'm unable to leave until then,   so that's why I was resting here.   All right.   Is there anything I can do for you?   No.   I see.   I pity you.   I won't tell Father about this,   so you should leave at sunset.   You're an interesting fellow.   What's that?   You won't force me to leave?   I could be a thief who snuck into steal the artwork here,   or even worse.   Or maybe you're justsaying that I can stay,   but you're going to report me.   Is that your wish?   No thief would lie and saythat they're allergic to sunlight.   Not even the devilwould tell a lie like that.   Hold on.   Did you sprain your ankle?   Was that my fault? Are you hurt?   Oh, no.   It's not your fault. I was born with this.   My left toes are bent,   but I can walk around just fine.   Do you believe in the force of gravity?   You tripped on me for a reason.   What are you saying?   Take this stone arrowhead.   If you have no use for it, that's fine.   But isn't it gravitythat draws people to each other?   I don't knowwhat impression you have of me,   but I travel to meet people.   If you ever wish to see me again,   wish upon this arrow and call me.   No matter how far in the futurethat may be.   Do you understand?   Just keep me in your back burner.   At sunset,   I will leave.   What's this?   My foot! The toes!   They're straight!   Wait! Who are you?   Father.   Please hear me out.    I must confess my sins.    Sorry,    let me go get the priest…    My body is stricken with an illness.    I don't have much longer.    But my confessionisn't about this illness.    It concerns my family.    It was    years ago, on June  th.    My baby d*ed,so I took another woman's baby,    and swapped the two babieswhile no one was looking.    I took one of the twins.    I cannot express how terrible I feelfor the baby's mother.    But I poured my heartinto raising this baby.    I had a happy life.    He grew up to be a great boy.    Shouldn't I tell him thathe has a twin brother    before I leave this world?    What if I tell him the truth,    and my son leaves me before I die?    So…    Do you know the other family?    They live in a large estatein the neighboring town.    The couple's name is Pucchi.    Seriously?    What's so good about a juice delivery boy?    Gross.    I bet he's a coward.    -I love that.-Forget him, his family's probably poor.    He doesn't even go to high school.    That's why he works.    Perla, isn't that your bag?    He snatched it!    Thief!    Someone stop him!    -Woo-hoo!-Yes!    Oh, crap!    I broke the store window.    I'll get fired fromthis part-time delivery job.    My school doesn't even allowstudents to work.    Weather Report's real nameis Wes Aquamarine.    He was    at the time.    He was innocentin every sense of the word,    and he relentlessly pursued justice.    Well… Thanks.    That was my bag he tried to steal.    I'll tell everyone thatthe thief smashed the window.    -Really?-Of course.    Now go.    I'm Wes.    People call me Weather.    Can I see you again?    Two months have passedsince that confession.    Father Pucchi was under distress.    Though not yet appointed a priest,    he is obliged to keep the privacyof the believers.    He must keep the confession a secret.    Otherwise,    he would be deemed unworthyas a clergyman.    That mother wants totake her secret to her grave.    Had I been able toconvince her to tell the truth,    how will we cope,and how will my younger brother react?    Will we be able totreat our families the same?    I'm home.    Welcome back.    Why are you spaced out on the porch?    Did something happen at school?    Please, Enrico.    Don't tell Mom and Dad about this!    What?    My grades are slipping.    I'll make up for it,but there's something on my mind.    I'm dating someone.    We met only two weeks ago,    but I really like him.    It's like our hearts are connected.I've never felt like this.    I'm happy for you, Perla.    Enrico…    Let me tell you how this went.    Father Pucchi never told his sister Perla,    that Weather was their biological brother.    I want you to judgethe rest of the events.    Who committed a sin?    Is it the mother, who swapped the babies?    Or is it Father Pucchi's parents?    Is it Father Pucchi?    Is it the younger brother Weather,who knows nothing?    Father Pucchi looked into Weather,the man his sister loved.    After learning the shocking truth,    Father Pucchi had only one choice to make.    I can't let my sister get hurt,no matter what!    You're that wealthy kidwho goes to divinity school.    Should you be doing this?    If you succeed, I'll give you double.    I have two requests.    One, do not ask any questions.    Two, make them break up.    If I can get some thugs to thr*aten Wes,    he'll break up with my sister.    That's all Perla will experience,    nothing but an ordinary heartbreak.    This won't leave a permanent scar.    However, Father Pucchibarely knew anything    about this private investigator,a jack of all trades.    How keen he was to information,nor the darkness he carried.    It is the darkness this society had,which was allowed by law a century ago.    It is a despicable old history.    I can't believe what I learnedabout Wes's birth.    In     , his mother married    a black man in the city.    That makes him the son of a black man.    The private detectivegathered other zealots.    Weather!    Perla…    What are you doing? You're all drunk!    We won't hurt you.    He's the one we need to punish.    Come give me a kiss.    One for this officer too!    You're a whore pretending to bea proper little missy.    Fool around with whomever you want,    but this bastard isn't allowedto kiss you, not even a little.    Your brother wanted this done.    And as for the womanwho gave birth to you,    we set her house on fire.    Who was the one truly being punished?    Was it Weather, Perla, or…    They all tried to love in their own ways.    These are the facts.    Father Pucchi's lovebrought the worst outcome.    Weather was hung highon a tree by a cliff,    and left to die.    Perla truly had a pure heart,    which was filled with a soft breezeuntil this moment.    Their love was like the warm spring sun.    However…    In my heart,    there will never be another drop of rain.    And with those words,    Perla threw herself downinto the lake below the cliff.    She did not knowthat Weather had a slight pulse.    Why?    How could this happen?    Why did I pursue the path of priesthood?    Why do people meet?    Had they never met,    this would have never happened.    No!    Stop that!    Don't make the sign of the crossat my sister!    Dammit.    Please, just don't take Perla's life!    Perla is innocent.    She only fell in love!    I'll do anything to bring her back!    I'm the one who should be punished!    Do you believe in the force of gravity?    We met for a reason.    If you wish,    come see me.    It's him.    That was his voice.    I want to see him.    He once healed my bent toesin the ossuary.    Why did I forget about him until now?    That's right, he gave me…    an arrowhead-like thing.    What is going on?    The arrowhead in my pocket?    Once a life is lost,    you cannot bring it back.    But it's up to you.    If you wish from deep within your heart,    you can retrieve her memory.    It's the memories of her heart.    This is your awakening.    Who the hell are you?    The idiot who wantedan affair investigated?    If you don't want to get sh*t,show your dirty face--    What's this?    If you know, then tell me.    What?    I heard you know everything.    What made these snails emergeout of the blue?    Where do they come from?    Why is it only happening near me?    Who the hell are you?    You said Perla's brotherasked you to split us.    Is that true?    No, you can't be…    What are these snails?    Damn. I knew it, I can't die.    The gunpowder is soaked.    But only when I try to sh**t myself.    Why am I still alive?    Weather was full of rage.    He was enraged at thosewho persecuted him,    at the fact that he was alive,    and that he couldn't save Perla.    Once Weather learned about Perla's death,    he jumped off the cliff.    Just then,there was a strong gust of wind.    He also tried to drown himselfin the lake,    but the waves brought him back to shore.    Why won't you let me die with Perla?    His anger was one of despair.    His vengeance spread to all,not just to the townspeople.    On the fourth night,    a horde of snails swarmed the town.    Why snails?    Where did they come from?    No one knew.    The only one who understoodthe cause of this incident    was Father Pucchi,who woke up in a hospital.    Wes… no, Weather did this.    My brother isn't dead.    We are twins.    My awakening led to his.    Just as I sought her memory,so did Weather, though subconsciously.    If these snails are here tocrawl up my arm,    then I have to go k*ll my brother.    I will resort to any and every methodfrom now on.    I will even take lives.    Once my score with Weather is settled,    I will go see him.    His name is Dio.    Why do people's paths cross?    If anyone can tell me, it's him.    I must know it.    The answer to this questionis the strongest power in this world.    It must also be the truth.    Are you satisfied?    Your sister Perla d*edbecause of your request.    And…    I can't suppress my rage.    We have a score to settle.    You're wrong.    It's because I am your older brother.    But that ends today.    Weather, meet your end.    Weather, you are in my way.    Now die,    and take those rainbows with you.    Vanish with Perla and all your memories.    A man with no memoriesmight as well be dead.    Live as if you're dead trapped in a cage.    Inmate MA      .    Imprisoned!    My sole purpose in life    is to settle my score with him.    So you've been revived.    Your memories returned!    But I thought you weregoing to meet up with Jolyne!    I'm only with you to find Jolyne!    You shouldn't go find Jolyne.    It'll be a waste of time.    Moreover,    I need someone to finish me off.    k*ll me.    I'm counting on you, Anasui.    That's why these beetles are calledsnail eaters!    These buggers!    Get in, guys!    They're coming in through the cracks!    What do we do, Jolyne?    Whether inside or outside the car,    it's over once we get devoured.    We'll go meet up with Weatheras we're being eaten!
05x32 - Heavy Weather (3)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:40Do you believe in the force of gravity?  We met for a reason.  Why?  How could this happen?  Why won't you let me die with Perla?  I can't suppress my rage.  We have a score to settle.  Weather, meet your end.  A man with no memoriesmight as well be dead.   EPISODE   : HEAVY FORECAST ( )   Dumbass!   Drive straight, idiot!   This better not be on purpose.   I can't even think about messing around!   Look, it's trying to eat me!   Weather…   What?   I sense Weather's presence near Pucchi's!   Are they together?   I can't tell,but they're near one another.   Weather!   What did you say? k*ll you?   -Yes.-Don't mess with me!   What is going on? Why do you say that?   In     ,   the same phenomenon struck my hometown.   What?   It seems that something deep withinmy heart is wreaking this havoc.   So your memories came back.   Then fix this mess!   I can't control this power.   k*ll me, and the Stand disappears.   I feel a sense of guiltabout turning people into snails,   but I abhor my life.   A part of me feels satisfiedto see this phenomenon.   You…   Jolyne better not be turning into a snail.   Try not to move.   I can't even begin to guess,   but it's likely that touching the snailstriggers metamorphosis.   Moreover,   I need someone to finish me off.   Stop with your bullshit.   Tell me where Jolyne is, right now!   I'll tell you after my scorewith Pucchi is settled.   Like I said, he is very close.   W-What?   He's here.   My sole purpose in life   is to settle my score with him.   I'm also doing this for F.F.   I have to stop Pucchifrom using Jolyne's father's memory.   It's time to put an end to everything.   I will finish off Pucchi.   Once I do, k*ll me.   Do you understand?   All right.   I also owe him one for F.F., too.   I'll see you through.   So where's the priest?   North? Or south?   It's not even a matter of the direction.   He's already here.   He's within our   -meter radius.   He's not underground.I checked with Diver Down.   Are you sure he's moving throughthese swarms of snails   to close in on us?   Weather Report!   There's no disruption in the air flow.   Nothing is breathing or moving.   What about inside the cars, Weather?   Weather!   I am painfully awareof your control over the weather.   Every living thing, animals, and insects,turns into snails in this phenomenon.   Once I learned how the weather works,   I no longer fear touching the snails!!   I now know why it happens.   When I extracted your memory in     ,   I overcame this Stand,though it almost cost me my life!   You…   Pucchi, you bastard!   You are also finished.   You should have servedyour prison sentence   instead of getting involvedwith Jolyne and me.   Dammit…   Why?   Why isn't Pucchi affected?   How do these snails work?   Tell me, Weather!   This will do.   If you are going to die, Weather,I hope it takes a few more hours.   That's why I blasted your leg off.   That should be enough time for your Stand   to eliminate anyone who gets in my way.   The one who will help me get to heaven,   it's none other than you, Weather.   The new moon rises in three days.   Then, everything will begin.   The thing that The Green Baby sought    and the heaven that Dio hoped to reachis inside my body.    I submerged Diver Down…    into Weather's body!    Weather Report!    Grab hold of the priest, Weather!    His Stand is inept at fighting!    Once you grab him, you can overpowerhim with your gust of wind!    Now, grab him! Don't let him get away!    What?    Weather!    Damn it, why am I turning?    I haven't touched any snails!    Pucchi!    What the hell did you do?    Tell me!    It's subliminal.    Like hidden words in a poster,    indiscernible wordsare incorporated in images.    Or a single frameis inserted into a film reel.    Though imperceptible they may be,    the subconscious retains that information.    That's the definitionof subliminal messaging in psychology.    It's an effect on the subconscious.    Subliminal messages easily enter the mindand stimulate instinct    more effectively than direct methods.    They powerfully influenceand take over human behavior.    Weather Report's rainbows    are sending subliminal messagesin the form of the weather.    The image is seeping into the heartsof everyone in the city.    Are images of snailshidden in the rainbows?    Do rainbows stimulate primitive instincts?    Anyone who sees the rainbow    starts to believe thatthey are turning into a snail.    This strong belief forces the bodyinto metamorphosis.    What? What did you just explain?    This is the answer.    It's the mechanism ofWeather Report's ability I sealed.    My hometown was affected by his powerslong ago.    When I saw a blind old womanunaffected by the phenomenon,    I realized how his ability works.    She was blind? That means…    Weather,    I don't need vision to see where you are.    I've extracted my sight,but I can sense you.    Let me tell you.    It's too late to close your eyes,Anasui.    Once the subliminal message settlesin your brain, you cannot undo its effect.    This phenomenon will not enduntil Weather dies.    I'll take the other leg, for good measure.    You will never stand again.    Diver Down!    Don't let your rash feelings take over.    We must all get to heaven.    My purpose can bringall human beings to heaven.    You are getting in my way.    You're letting a few deaths dictatethe fate of the masses!    Domine quo vadis?    You shall be crucified!    What… just stabbed me?    This is your doing, Weather.    What are you doing?    What is this sound?    What are you scheming to do?    This Weather Report abilityis something I can control.    I can take my time.What counts is that I form them.    They can be simple!    The blood was blown upwards,then frozen with a cold draft.    He's making spikes in the blood puddles.    The priest can't see them!    What will you choose?    Yes, it's your choice to stay blind,    but you may also choose to seewhat's happening for yourself!    Trip, and your life will end.    I'm coming for you now.    STAND NAME: PALE SNAKESTAND MASTER: FATHER PUCCHI    Pucchi, you have no way to escape.    Will you restore your sight?    Do it. I'll reflect the rainbowsright into your face.    Weather just has to grab Pucchi.    Pale Snake is no matchfor Weather Report.    Weather will win.    I knew you'd resist somehow.    No, you won't just let me leave.    Not after regaining those memories.    And yet!    Anasui!    Eyes are everywhere.    I used them to get this far.    Anasui, do me a favor.    Be my eyes.    Tell me what you see.    Tell me the dangers that surround me.    What is Weather doing?    He used his spilled blood to make spikesthat protrude from the ground.    Three spikes right behind you.    Four more to your right.    I see.    Will you guide me out of this spike trap?    Continue.    Take three steps,and six spikes lie ahead.    Turn left.    Weather.    You were cursed from the momentyou were born.    Stay down.    Your life is fated for doom.Nothing can save it.    It would've been betterif you had lost your memories forever.    Turn left and take five steps.    Face right, and you are out.    Okay. Five steps.    That's right. Five more steps.    Also, I just noticed this.    Since I can see it, I'll tell you.    There's one more spike.    I didn't notice it until nowsince I was looking down at the ground.    One of them pierced through your shoulder.    Weather is freezing your blood.    Oh, too late.    A cheap trick!    It's not a trick.    Weather is stronger than you.    Weather is going to win!    This wind pressure!    I must get out of Weather's att*ck range!    Just evade once.    He just has enough strength leftfor one att*ck!    Take your own blood spikes!    It's useless!    Weather can dodge your throw easily!    Yes, he will dodge.    When he does, the wind pressurewill shift its direction.    That's my chance to escape!    You're mine now.    I finally have you.    He didn't dodge.    Weather caught the priestby freezing more blood!    Weather has him in his range!    Is he dead?    Let go, Weather.    I had every chance to finish you offinside Green Dolphin Street Prison.    But… I hoped to save you one day.    That's why I took your memory only.    I'm not pleading for my lifeto save my own skin.    Prime numbers.    -I did it for you, my younger brother.-Two,    Three,    -It was for the ability to get to heaven.-Five.    Someone must reach heaven one day.    Seven.    -Don't do this, Weather.-Eleven.    -Stop trying to end your life and mine!-Thirteen.    Seventeen.    You do not realize your own evil.    You are the worst form of evil.    -Nineteen.-He's horrified.    The priest's face is frozen with despair.    Twenty-three.    Stop this, Weather. You are wrong!    You are nothing but a cursed man!    -And yet, I kept you alive!-You are finished now,    Father Pucchi!    What the hell are you doing?    I said I'll k*ll you ifyou do anything suspicious!    No! A dust storm suddenly started.    Something like a screw busted the tire!    I lost control!    He's close by.    We are close to Weather!    The priest too!    But something about the outside seems off.    You're right I can't see well,    but something issticking out of the ground.    Weather!    I know you're close by.Answer me, Weather!    What the hell are these things?    What happened here?    The priest is moving close to us.    We are extremely close to him.    We have to find Weather.We need to find him as soon as we can.    There's something horrific happening here.    Did Weather cause this dust storm?    Hasn't the priest turnedinto a snail by now?    I don't know.    I just know that he's here.Search for him!    Jolyne, I saw someone.    He's over this direction!    I can't tell whether it was Pucchi orWeather, but I definitely saw someone!    Jolyne, the wind is dying.    Also, my body is starting togo back to normal.    Does this mean…    Pucchi!    No, Jolyne.    We can't fully controlour bodies or Stands yet.    We lack the speedand strength to defeat him.    We have to find Weather first.    Defeat the priest,and we'll know where Weather is.    Stone Ocean!    Jolyne!    -What?-Weather!    No one can catch up to me now.    Spend your remaining dayswith your family and loved ones.    It's futile to come after me.    I will win.    Stop, Jolyne.    Anasui!    This isn't the priest.    The priest already left.    What?    This is a revelation.    That's not Pucchi either.It's a visage of the past.    This must be Pucchi's ability too.    Versus!    The priest    left a disc in his headduring the dust storm.    Pucchi's visage overlapped with his body.    This was the presence you sensed.    The priest had already finished him off.    This is a revelation.    Fate had chosen me.    -It is guiding me to heaven…-…in three days' time.    -If it hadn't, I would have been defeated…-Do you believe in the force of gravity?    You were drawn here by gravity.    Weather!    I told you. It's a visage.    -No one can catch up…-…to me now…    I'm no longer a snail. What happened?    Where's Weather, Anasui?    Where did Weather go?Ermes, where's Weather?    You don't sense his presence anymore?    You don't know where he is?    Emporio!    Ermes, call a doctor.    -The doctors should be back to normal.-Jolyne…    -Emporio!-Jolyne!    The wind has stopped blowing.    The rainbows are gone, Jolyne.    This can't be.    Does this have something to dowith our car accident?    Did this happen because we came?    Listen, Jolyne.    People say that I'm a cold-blooded k*ller.    At least, the newspapers said so,and I completely agree with it.    When they asked meif I would give my life for my parents,    I answered no.    I would still say the same.    My parents can't move my heart.    But…    I will give my life for the peoplewho brought me back to life.    Weather was one of these people.    This disc…    Right.    When Weather got impaled by Pale Snake,    he used his enemy's ability.    He used Pale Snaketo seal his ability inside a disc.    Jolyne…    Weather left this for you.    Weather came back to lifewhen he left the prison.    This is the proof.    He was truly happy the last few days.    Weather was already saved!    Weather…    I wish…    I wish we could talk just one more time.    I want to talk to youin the warm breeze again.

MARCH   ST,      -   :   AM   TWO MORE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON   Weather Report…   He didn't want me to despair,   and wanted to tell meto keep going after the priest.   So he used Pale Snake's ability   to leave his own ability in a disc.   If I insert this disc into my head,   would I be able to use his ability?   But the priest is alreadyon his way to Cape Canaveral.   We don't even have two daysuntil the new moon.   It could well be   that this is already out of my hands.   What should I do?   Despite the snail commotion,   my father's disc is now inthe Speedwagon Foundation's hands.   My father will wake up sooner or later.   He would know what to do.   Should I wait for him?   But the priest may take drastic measuresin Cape Canaveral before Dad wakes up.   What should I do?   Dad, tell me.   Had I not gotten in the car,   would Weather still be alive?   No, I have to keep moving forward.   I have to go to Cape Canaveral.   I have to defeat the priest.   Dad, tell me.   What can someone like me do?   What can I do?   EPISODE   : GRAVITY OF THE NEW MOON   How cute.   Wow.   She looks adorable.   Jolyne fell asleep on my shoulder!   That's right.   I finally found you.   There's something I meant to tell you   if I managed to break out of prisonand find you.   I don't have time to waste.   If I don't say this now, then when?   My feelings are honest and true.   I spent a fortune buying this ringfrom the prison scrounger.   Once you wake up,   please accept my love for you.   Hey, look!   Alligators! They're this far inland!   Dammit.   They may be a protected species,but they sure gave us hell in prison!   Seriously? Whoa, massive alligators.   Take this, dumbass!   Woo-hoo, I got one!   They reacted! They're startled!   They're not moving, but they're scared.   Don't mess with us, you overgrown lizards!   Dumbasses!   You couldn't have…   Jolyne!   What did you throw just now?   Show it to me. Show me your hand!   What's with you?   What's all this shouting?   I said, open your hand!   What the hell?   Anasui, why are you excited?   You…   You couldn't have! You can't have!   Ermes.   -Can you do me a favor?-What is it?   I want to see the map for this area.   Can you hold onto this for me?   Sure.   When you say map, you mean GPS, right?   This is such an old computer.   This is our current location,Cape Canaveral.   North latitude,    degrees    minutes,   west longitude,    degrees    minutes.   Cape Canaveral is on the Florida Peninsulaby the Atlantic Ocean.   It's a vast area of   ,    hectares.   It's a sandbank formed by natureover a long time.   Sandbank?   It's a geological featureformed by sand deposits.   This is our destination.   The Space Center.   There are no trains or buses.   You can only access the facilityby car, either owned or rented.   This is where they launchrockets, satellites,   and test space shuttles.   That's the space shuttle assembly factory.    Over here is the launch site and lookout.    Each facility ismore than five kilometers apart.    That's how big this place is.    We will enter through the Visitor Center.    All general admissionhas to come in through here.    We'll buy the tickets,pass through security,    and then hop on the tour bus.    The other areas are off-limits,    so this must be the same routethe priest would take.    I don't know what he wants to do here,    but I believe he will spendthe remaining days until the new moon    somewhere inside the Space Center.    No more.    Due to security concerns,we are limiting the number of visitors.    Please wait in line.    Oh, but he's with me.    You'll let him slide, right?    Sure.    Now, come along.    You would've had to waitanother    minutes.    Are you a pastor? Or a priest?    I'm trying to do small acts of kindnessin my everyday life.    Are you a tourist?    Do clergymen have an interest in rockets?    You just seem out of place.    Actually, I kind of understand.God and space.    How symbolic.    Would you be offended if I askedif God was an alien?    Do I have to tolerateyour incessant questions?    You did a good deed,so you can leave me alone now.    If you're bored of waiting in line,go waste your time somewhere else.    I didn't come herejust to rush for    minutes.    Gravity is the biggest obstaclewhen launching a rocket.    Ideally, a rocket can launch most easily    if there is lessgravitational pull upon it.    That's why launching a rocketalong the equator      gives it an advantage over gravity.    This is becausethe Earth's centrifugal force    causes gravity to weakenalong the equator.    Athletes may be able to breaktheir records near the equator.    Something's wrong. I don't feel well.    In addition,the sea level of Cape Canaveral    has a unique characteristic.    The sea level is described as "zero mark"when measuring elevation.    However, recent studies have revealedthat the sea's surface is not always zero.    For example, in the Indian Oceanby the Maldives Archipelago,    the sea level curves downby about     meters.    On the other hand, the Sea of Japancurves up by    meters,    and Cape Canaveral is   meters above the zero mark.    This could be dueto inconsistencies in gravity.     Cape Canaveral is one such locationwith weaker gravity.    When tides are taken into account,    it is said that sea level may riseby upwards of     meters.    Cape Canaveral    is the most suitable locationon Earth for a rocket launch.    Yikes, it's cold.    What?    What the… What happened to my cola?    STAND NAME: Diver DownSTAND MASTER: NARCISO Anasui    So, Jolyne.    What is your plan?    Do you want to wait forthe Speedwagon Foundation and Mr. Jotaro?    Or do you want to keepgoing after the priest?    I…    Yes, we'll find him now.    Sorry, but we don't knowif your father will come in time.    He may not even come for two days.    Weather left the priest in shambles.    His allies are all down.    The timing is impeccable.    The only thing for sureis that if we don't hurry,    then we'd miss our chance.    Hey Emporio, what are you doing?    Cut that out.    Why did you stop the car?    I'm not trying to.    Hey! I said get the car moving.    This is a stolen car.    We are wanted criminals.That hasn't changed.    -Also, a kid is in the driver's seat.-That's not it.    The car's acting up!    -What is it?-I don't know, it suddenly slowed down!    Ermes, switch with him.    Hey…    What are those things?    What's going on?    Brace for impact!    What's happening?    Cars! What the hell is going on?    Did a bad crash cause an expl*si*n?    Emporio, pedal to the metal!We need to go!    I can't!    It won't move!    The road is collapsing!    No, the road is fine.    It's not collapsing,and the guardrails are intact.    There's no wind from an expl*si*n!    You might thinkI'm messing around, Jolyne,    but I'm holding on for my life.    This car… This is bad!    Get out! You need to go!This car isn't safe!    At this rate, we're going to fall!    We aren't falling down, but sideways!    What do you mean, we're falling?    The other cars fell already.    They slid down this roadas if it's a cliff!    The car is shaking!    The front tires are in the air!    Everyone, get out of the car!    Is this the priest's ability?    It's not the new moon yet.How could this be?    It's growing stronger,the force is pulling us sideways!    Get out of the car, hurry!    It's going to flip backwards!    We're falling not down, but sideways.    How far will we fall?    Jolyne! Don't let go of Emporio!    Diver Down!    Ermes!    Stone Ocean!    How far did you fall, Ermes?    How far did you go?    Jolyne, we're going to fall!    At this rate, we'll get hit by debris!    Jolyne, forget Ermes for now.    If she survives, she'll find us.    But…    We've almost reached him,    but you'd rather retreat than find him?    That's enough.    Jolyne, your body won't last!    How is this possible?    I can't believe this.    How can we fall sideways?    Don't we have the groundbecause of gravity?    This is what the priesthoped to accomplish.    This is the power my father sealedin Egypt    years ago.    This is what the priest called "heaven"!    Some trees aren't being uprooted.    Looks like the Visitor Centeris still in one piece.    Jolyne.    You said this is "heaven,"but this might just be the beginning.    I have this feeling thatthings will turn for the worse.    The priest is waiting for the new moon.    It plays a vital role in gravity,and the new moon is only    hours away.    Listen, Jolyne,Weather left the priest in a bad state.    I know firsthand that he's hurt.    Now's our chance to strike.He's the one who's cornered.    Let's climb this guardrailup to the Visitor Center.    You're sure the priest is this way?    Yes. He's up ahead.    Go, Jolyne.    Of course. My mind is made up.    That's right. Those eyes of yours, Jolyne.    Your face as you starefar into the distance.    That's what makes my heart race.    Let's go, Emporio.    Okay.    Right now, your heart    burns with the resolve to stop the priest.    At the same time, you're hopingyour father will come to save you.    I'm the one who can protect you,not Weather, nor Jotaro.    In time, you'll begin to wishthat you were in my arms.    In the beginning of all matter,there was gravity.    Even for this earth,    gravity was its beginning.    Gravity keeps the planets revolving.    Where shall I head on this earth now?    What is going to transpire?    To my body and mind…    and to the end of all things?    Someone!    Someone, save us!    What in the world is going on?    What is happening?    Help!    Someone, come save us!    -Anyone!-They're going to be all right.    No need to help them.    My phone doesn't have service.It can't reach a tower!    Why?    I can't even begin to guess.    Maybe my phone is busted.    It could also be causedby this gravity thing,    but I really don't know.    Anyway, I have no ideawhat's going on in other places.    Are rescue teams on their way?    This is the ticketing office box, Jolyne.    That's the entrance    to the Visitor Center.    Jolyne, the priest is still here, right?    Yes, he's close. He's almost within reach.    It's as if he was just here.    What?    This thing… it can't be!    But why? What happened to it?    Pale Snake.    No, The Green Baby!    The priest's Stand evolved!    Unbelievable!    Jolyne!    My right hand!    I came to finish you off now,    if you can't wait two days.    MARCH   ST,        :   A.M.       HOURS AND    MINUTES UNTIL THE NEW MOON
05x34 - C-Moon (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:42What's wrong with these eggs?  A Stand…  Pale Snake is no longer my Stand ability.  Something else is inside me… but what?  I feel terrible…  Something is running loose inside me.  This power, it's beyond my control.  But this power carries hope.  I can at least feelhope within this power.   Dio's memo inside Jotaro's memory…   It seems this power needsthe things in that memory.   Time and place.   North latitude,    degrees    minutes.   West longitude,    degrees    minutes.   That's where heaven will be.   This location is Cape Canaveral.   Kennedy Space Center.   In the beginning of all matter,there was gravity.   Even for this earth,   gravity was its beginning.   What's going on?   At this rate, we're going to fall!   We aren't falling down, but sideways!   Is this the priest's ability?   Jolyne! Don't let go of Emporio!   Diver Down!   Ermes!   Gravity keeps the planets revolving.   Where shall I head on this earth now?   What is going to transpire?   This is the power my father sealedin Egypt    years ago.   This is what the priest called "heaven"!   To my body and mind…   and to the end of all things?   That's the entrance to the Visitor Center…   Jolyne, the priest is still here, right?   Yes, he's close. He's almost within reach.   It's as if he was just here.   The priest's Stand evolved!   My right hand!   EPISODE   : C-Moon ( )   I came to finish you off now,   if you can't wait two days.   Jolyne Cujoh!   My arm is turning inside out!   -Jolyne!-Jolyne!   So you are the one who's beenhelping Jolyne this whole time.   Emporio, get behind Anasui!   Stone Ocean!   Jolyne, behind you!   I'll get rid of Jolyne Cujoh first.   Anasui, get over here. Hurry!   What is this Stand?   Your strands turned inside out!   It turned my spike inside out too!   That's where his fist touched,   but it was merely a scratch!   We have to stay away from his att*cks!   It must be gravity.Think of the events leading up to now!   The stand ability must berelated to gravity!   All matters including the Earth and applesare affected by gravity.   Gravity attracts mattertowards the center of mass!   That's the cosmic law!   This Stand ability alters gravityand changes its direction!   Anything that touches its fistturns inside out.   I don't know its range,but it makes everything fall sideways!   So that's how the weak gravityat Cape Canaveral   affected and evolved the priest's Stand!   Its powers are completely differentfrom Pale Snake's memory manipulation,   nor is it The Green Baby's powerof infinite division.   Jolyne, it's coming to strike again!   Go to Anasui, Emporio!   It took a hit!   Impossible!   My leg is inverting!   Jolyne!   This can't be!   Don't panic, Emporio.   You can relax.   If everything it touches turns inside out,   then I'll let it hit me againto revert my body back right side out.   Turn my body inside out…   and outwards again!   Jolyne!   Good grief.   Of course,   I have to stitch the wounds.   One thing is for certain now.   Every strike I deal leaves damage!   If I have to strike it downhere and now, then…   We have no time to waste.   Climb, Emporio.   Get to the guardrails.   I'm here as Jolyne's backup,not your babysitter!   I'm going!   Jolyne!   I already turned   this ticketing box office inside out!   The way it moves…    Judging by the powers,I thought it was an auto-tracking Stand,    but the att*cks are too accurate!    As if it knows that it's useless,    so it's no longer targetingmy arms and legs.    It's now aiming for my vitalslike my head and chest,    the only places that would be fatal!    It dodged my kickswith machine-like precision!    This Stand is a remote control type!    The priest's eyes are watching.    This Stand's att*cks are precisebecause the priest can see the fight!    Its att*cks only seem destructive    because its poweris amplified by gravity.     Where is he?I assumed he was hiding, but he's close!    He is close enough from hereto see us clearly!    Diver Down!    Stay down.    Anasui!    I said, I'll get rid of Jolyne first.    Anasui, Jolyne!    Stone Ocean!    Jolyne!    What did you do, Jolyne?    Anasui!You might be able to help yourself.    It's easy for you to jump on the pavement,    but for now, don't let go of my rope.    Your weight is choking our foe.The Stand is powerless!    Not only that, it doesn't havethe strength to break free!    Unbelievable!    It's trying to grab Jolyne's stringbefore it suffocates!    If it grabs Jolyne's rope with its hands…    The thread will turn inside outand disintegrate!    Jolyne, let go of its neck.    I did this to free you from its grasp!    No, Anasui. I have to face it now.    Our chance is now,with the rope around its neck!    I'm not trying to strangle it.    I'll close in and finish it off!    What are you saying, Jolyne?    If it grabs a hold of this rope,    it will invert your thread.    Then your arm will get inverted as well!    Damn you!    I'll reach you in no time, just you wait!    No matter what I say, Jolyne won't listen.    We're in a horrible situation.    f*ck it!    If you're finishing it off, then be quick!    Hurry up and break free!    Ah, he grabbed her rope!    No, I still have time.    My threadwill stay intact just a moment longer!    STAND NAME: C-MoonSTAND MASTER: FATHER PUCCHI    This is Sigma Team.    It's no good, we can't go any further.    The t*nk flipped over!    Get any closer to the Visitor Center,    and the t*nk flips upside down!    What do you mean, "the t*nk flips?"    Report!    It's just as I said.    The t*nk flips over!    Some force is flipping the t*nk over.    We can't figure it out.    Please send scientists or expertsto investigate.    Don't try to figure it out.    Our mission is to rescue the victims!    Still, we really have no ideawhat's going on.    We don't know if there are survivors,or how big the affected area is.    The entire place is a mess.    What is going on?    It's as if a hammer fell from the skyand pounded onto the ground,    and turned the area into a scrapyard!    This is J-Hawk  .    I have vision on the center.It's three kilometers away.    Attempting to locate the survivors.    What the hell?    Which way is up?    Mayday!    J-Hawk  ?    J-Hawk  !    What happened? Do you copy?    J-Hawk  , do you copy?    This is our opportunityto defeat the priest's Stand!    But this is too risky!    Jolyne's arm is getting shredded!    Don't waste your time!    Hurry up and finish it off!    Stone Ocean!    It's inverting the steel platingto stand itself up!    Hurry! Hurry up and finish it!    This is hopeless,it's almost all the way up!    It ripped more tiles off!    It grabbed her string!    Jolyne, let go of it!    You have to run!Your arm will get shredded!    Diver Down!    I submerged Diver Down into the rope.    And now, instead of Jolyne's rope,    my body will turn inside out!    Anasui.    Get it, Jolyne. As long as your stringis wrapped around its neck,    I won't let it get up!    -Anasui!-Now go! End this fight, Jolyne!    After all, it was in my best interestto get rid of you when I had the chance.    When you were in prison,at the very beginning.    Jesus bore the fate of being crucified.    Mary, Mother of Jesus,was fated to lose her son.    To achieve happiness,humans must bear a curse,    and overcome fate.    The trial Dio and I had to overcomewas Joestar's bloodline.    This can't be…    The priest is here!    I have come to save my Stand,which is still undergoing evolution.    What?    My body is rising towards the sky!    I am the center of gravity.    Gravity is reversed wherever I stand.    The closer you come to me,the stronger the gravity gets.    The last step is to bide my timeuntil my ability fully evolves.    It will harness even greater power,    not the little strength it has now.    Anasui, pull on her rope!    I'm trying already!    Listen closely, my Stand.    I'll say this again. Invert her only once.    Do not strike more than once.    The att*ck to a vital areais more devastating    than one to the arms or body.    Remember, a single punch will do.    Splendid.We shall return to the Visitor Center.    What?    The fight is over.    Jolyne can no longer feel painor even think.    Her heart was turned inside out,    reversing the blood flow to her brain.    Anasui, pull her close!    Hurry, draw her in!    Jolyne's strings…    No…    This can't be happening!    Jolyne!    This ability,    I shall name it C-Moon.    Invincibility.    Did I gain invincibilitybefore the new moon?    However, my ultimate goaldoes not lie in simply achieving strength.    I shall remind myself that my pursuitis the happiness of all human beings.    Jolyne Cujoh is no more than a casualty,    just like Weather and the prisonerswhose lives were sacrificed.    To successfully achieve a goal,    trial and sacrifice is inevitable.    I don't believe this.    What should I do, Jolyne?    What happened just now…    No, this can't be happening!    What's that?    Where is that sound coming from?    It's the phone!    It didn't have a signal a moment ago.    I got a new message.    Who is it from?    My calls aren't going through.    The gravitational anomaly seems tohave sent a satellite out of orbit.    Are you Emporio?    I don't know exactly what's going on,    but I can sense that my daughterand the priest have met.    Could this be…    Is this him?    Is this message from…    Jolyne is alive.    But she's not safe.    Protect Jolyne.    Just until I arrive… that's all I ask.    She must have discovered how tocounter his gravity.    That's the only wayshe could have survived.    She's alive, but just barely.    Jotaro Kujo.    It's Mr. Jotaro!    He's nearby!    I don't believe this.    Jolyne is alive!    That means…    No, this can't be!    Anasui, find Jolyne!    Jolyne isn't dead!    What?    But the priest knows too,    because he must've sensedthat she's alive!    What did you do, Jolyne Cujoh?    Your heart was turned inside out!    Gravity imploded your heart!    How could she still be alive?    How did she manage to survive?    We must settle the score.    The Joestar bloodline must be overcome!    Diver Down!    Where are you going?    Isn't it obvious?    The best way to protect Jolyneis to k*ll that priest!    MARCH   ST,        :   AM       HOURS AND    MINUTES UNTIL THE NEW MOON

I was certain of it.   Could it be Joestar's blood,   the bloodline of Kujo?   Is it getting in the way of Dio and me,once again?   I absolutely must finish offJolyne Cujoh here.   Both in prison and in Orlando,Jolyne Cujoh interfered.   She's a trial that I must overcometo achieve my purpose.   Have confidence, Father Pucchi.   Fate will choose to side with me.   Dio and I have a purpose much granderthan their pitiful sense of justice.   Not a single human can hinder my plans!   Hey you…   Call a doctor.   What happened to my hip bone?   Help me!   I'm close. I'm very close.   Jolyne Cujoh fell near here.   She's here.That's a piece of Jolyne's clothing.   Jolyne went inside this building.   By the way, do not comea single step closer to me.   Stand back.I don't even count you as an obstacle.   Retreat, C-Moon!   That man is not Anasui!   Diver Down can submerge in more placesthan just the walls or the ground.   I found a tourist who d*edfrom your gravity ability,   and changed his bone structureto match mine.   You're already within my range.   Take this! Diver Down!   I missed!   He turned his own face inside out.   To me, you're merely a pesky flyI can easily swat away.   She touched my face.   That was Jolyne Cujoh's hand.   She's on the move.   What is she planning to do?   How is she able to move?   That's blood.   She is wounded, without a doubt.   My heart tells me to track her down,no matter what.   I will end her, right here and now!   Jotaro Kujo will be here any minuteto rescue Jolyne Cujoh.   If Anasui rejoins the fight,the battle will be difficult.   Jolyne Cujoh's allies are headed this way   in hopes to save her life.   Hence it is now,   I must vanquish you, once and for all.   Your death   shall crush the resolve and hopesof your allies who have gathered here.   Especially Jotaro,who will lose his daughter.   His purpose and resolve in lifeshall vanish along with Jolyne.   He will no longer be a matchfor Dio and me.   I must finish her off, here and now!   I will find you, no matter the cost!   Come out, Jolyne Cujoh!   Show yourself!   Jolyne Cujoh!   It's only her thread.   Dammit, she's behind me!   I will give it my allto k*ll you right here!   I know that you are wounded!    I am the center of gravity,so if I turn my body upside down,    everything will fall toward my feet.    C-Moon!    Both strikes landed!    Both your arms are now useless!    Those strange shapes…    Why didn't her arms turn inside out?    How could this be?    Show yourself, Jolyne Cujoh!    You cannot run from your fate!    What is that thing?    What is that?    What's the shape of that thing,where her heart should be?    Stone Ocean!    Mobius strips?    Is that what you're creating?    STAND NAME: STONE OCEANSTAND MASTER: JOLYNE CUJOH    Start tracing its surface with a finger,    and keep going.    Follow the surfacewithout lifting the finger.    Before long, you have traced both sides.    You will be back at your starting point.    This non-orientable shapewas discovered in the   th century    by a German mathematician.    It is called "Mobius strip,"after his name.    The back side existsonly if there is a front side.    If there's no front and back,there's no turning inside out.    A non-orientable infinity strip    can be made with thread!    Is that what she created?    Did she make a Mobius stripthe instant she was struck?    I admire the first humanwho tried to eat mushrooms.    They risked poisoning themselves.    Was he a fool who happened to get lucky?    Otherwise,    was the discovery drivenby his desperate starvation?    Would you survive if I strike your head?    A single hit will do.    Which angle would be best?    A single hit to the head is all it takes.    Is this all you've got?    I'm disappointed.    Come at me with everything you got!    No.    I'm waiting for a definitive moment.    I've been circling you, containing myself.    I'm waiting forthe perfect moment to strike.    Do you understand?    The more I walk around,    the more these objects fall.    That's why I'm waiting.    I'm waiting for victoryto fall into my hands.    Do you understand?    Is your Mobius strip enough to save you,    considering your wounds?    There it is.The chance I've been waiting for!    A security officer's corpse!    It's in my hand!    Jolyne!    -sh*t!-Whoa!    Dammit.    Jolyne!    Jolyne!    What?    The Speedwagon Foundation    sh*t this harpoon from the skythree kilometers above.    It was aimed to landon the Visitor Center's premises.    I made a copy of it with my sticker,and duplicated the harpoon.    When the sticker is removed,the copy flies back to the original.    I clung on to the harpoon,so that despite your gravity,    I can be pulled up here in an instant.    Then, I used my Standto break it into pieces.    We came to this spotwhere he felt her presence.    Dad…    Jotaro Kujo and Ermes!    You're surrounded, Father Pucchi.    Completing your Stand in    hourswas just your wishful thinking.    It's over.    You have no allies left.    You will be defeated beforethe new moon arrives!    You're mistaken, Emporio.    As I thought, fate…    gives me trials, yet sides with me.    The ones who will aid mein attaining my powers    are the Joestar descendants!    After being stuck underthis steel framing,    I now understand!    My allies were the Kujos all along!    What the hell?He's rising up towards the sky!    I am the center of gravity.    I understand now, Dio!    This is the answer.    I have no need to wait another    hoursfor the new moon to arrive.    I need the gravitational forceof the new moon.    Then I'll just float higher in the sky    and find an areawith equal gravitational pull.    I'll put myself where there is gravityequal to that of the new moon!    There must be an exact spotthat can complete C-Moon's power!    You think we'll let you get away?    You don't know when to surrender, do you?    Stay calm, look for the exact location.    Count the prime numbersand maintain my composure.    -Thirteen, seventeen…-That bastard is muttering something!    Gravity hasn't changed!    It's still pulling us sideways.    Ermes, look to your right.    Pick up the g*n he dropped.    You've grown, Jolyne.    Hold onto the guardrails.    Ermes,    pick up the g*n and sh**t him.    C-Moon!    Star Platinum: The World!    You wish to use your Standto deflect the b*ll*ts.    Time can stay stopped fora maximum of five seconds.    You will not see this harpoon.    Once the time starts again,    the harpoon will impale you.    Three seconds.    Two seconds.    One second.    Time will now start.    What just happened?    The harpoon missed.    He dodged during my time stop.    That priest…    He's unharmed.    He's opening the hatch.    It looks like he's trying to board it.    The Space Shuttle is in the air!    The priest is insidethe exhibition Shuttle!    He dodged the harpoon, but how?    Damn…    he's not only trying to get away.    Don't tell me…    he learned somethingthat he shouldn't have,    a condition that will allow himto complete his Stand!    It is you who broughtthis Pucchi to heaven.    All this time, even in prison,my allies were you.    Father in heaven,    guide me!    Watch over me,    that I shall not stray from my path.    I give myself to thee!    Yes, I feel it!    The position! It's here!

I give myself to thee!   Yes, I feel it!   The position! It's here!   EPISODE   : Made in Heaven ( )   I felt the power surge at the positionwhere I dodged Jotaro's harpoon.   You, the Joestar bloodline,helped me reach heaven!   Look!   It's Anasui!   He's found his wayonto the Shuttle's outer shell!   Eat this! Diver Down!   My ability is no longer C-Moon.   At last, the time for heaven has come.   My ability is complete!   The power of gravity   radiates throughout my body!   Rot in hell,   you scumbag!   It's news at noon.   The incident on the State Road    at Cape Canaveral   has accounted for  ,    casualties.   It was originally believed to becaused by road cave-ins,   however, there seems to beother underlying causes.   Helicopters have crashed,and rescue missions have failed.   We will continue to reportafter the break.   Where are we?   What was that?   Where's Anasui?   What is going on?   Where's Anasui?   Are you worried about me, Jolyne?   I'm touched that you care about me.   But first, we need to find the priest.   He was engulfed by light,and I lost sight of him.   We have to find the Space Shuttle, now!   The Shuttle is right over there.   The Shuttle hasn't moved,   but we have.   We shifted about     metersfrom where we were.   Just a moment ago,   we were on the other sideof that building.   I hate to point this out, Jotaro,   but I didn't feel any impactmoving us here.   Did anyone see anything?   We must have been blasted to this sideby the reversed gravity.   The direction of gravitywent back to normal a moment ago.   Besides, Pucchi saidhe no longer has C-Moon.   Jolyne, where is the priest?   Can you sense where he is?   I can sense that he's close,but that's about it.   His location and directionare undetectable.   I can't tell.   What bothers me more   is how Pucchi saw my harpoon.   He eyed the Star Platinum harpoonin stopped time.   He saw the harpoon, so he evaded it.   But how?   I get it now.   The priest was just talking nonsense.   The time of heaven,completing his Stand, whatever!   He was just bluffing.   He just used trickery to deceive us,so that he can hide.   He thinks he can completely lose us now.   Ermes,   it's in your best interestnot to step in there.   -What?-Stay in an open area.   This rain will soon…   I'm… drenched.   What's going on, guys?    Ermes?    What are you doing?    It's this a*t*matic door!    It's super fast!    What the hell?    It's snapping shut like a hydraulic press!    I'm dry.    I was soaked a moment ago.    What the hell is going on?    Watch your head, Ermes.    What?    It's time for the evening news.    We have a developing story    on the State Road     incidentat Cape Canaveral.    Oh? Um, my apologies.    I almost skipped the break.    Wait, the break ended already?    The sun…It's dusk!    Well, can I have chocolate nuts, caramel,    strawberry chocolate chips, and mint?    Oh, and top it off with orange vanilla.    That'll be six dollars.    What the…    Strike!    Wow, look at this rookie go!    He's been named our MVP!    Oh, am I actually that good?    The tissue hardened.    Ouch…    It's stuck to my nose!    Barry, go graba   -kilogram chunk of meat.    On it, boss.    He finally got a hit!    Unfortunately, it's a pitcher's fly!    What happened?    He's bleeding like crazy!    How did his blood get everywhere?    We lost control!    We're crashing at top speed!    But the readings are all within range!    We're dead.    Pull up!    What was that?    What in the world is happening?    Ermes!    It wasn't a bluff.    The priest wasn't just telling liesto get away.    And my blood…    I haven't stopped bleeding,    but my blood is already dry.    Fresh blood is drying up!    Jolyne, look at the blood on your face.    It's drying up and crusting!    You're right.    What could be causing this?    This can't be…    It must have started at that moment!    The priest has been executing his abilitysince he was in the Shuttle!    All things are movingat an incredible speed!    Everything in this world,    not only man-made things,but things in nature too!    The sun is already down!    The stars are beginning to come out!    Is this his completed ability?    STAND NAME: STAR PLATINUMSTAND MASTER: JOTARO KUJO    What in the world is going on?    This is caused bythe priest's new ability.    sh*t!    The stars and the clouds are drifting    like special effects in a movie!    Is this the priest'sfully developed ability?    There's more.    Time. It's accelerating!    Time is passing faster and faster!    In this situation, is he the only one?    What if no one else can function    in the flow of this accelerated time?    That's highly likely.    When he dodged my harpoon,    he may have done so unconsciously.    But what if he can keep upwith this accelerated time?    What if he realized what he's capable of?    Jolyne, we can't stay here.    It's dangerous.It's not safe to be here like this.    -No…-Do you sense him too, Jolyne?    -Do you sense his presence?-What?    Where is he?    He's on the move.    I can't tell his exact position,    but he's approaching us from the shadows!    This is bad, we need to go.    Everyone, get moving! Quickly!    Star Platinum: The World!    My ability's duration is shortened!    This is bad!    This way, Jotaro!    You…    -Your name is Anasui, correct?-That's right.    My Stand is called Diver Down.    It can submerge into various surfaces.    Let's go look out at the other side.    Yeah. But considering his speed,being on the lookout may not help much.    By the way, Jotaro…    I will do everything I canto protect your daughter.    Yes, things may seem desperate,    but we'll make it out of this fight.    So please, allow meto take your daughter's hand in marriage.    What did you just say?    I said, please give me your permission.    Jotaro, let me marry your daughter.    I know this isn't the right time,but all I want is your blessing.    If only I had your permission,then I can be at peace.    I don't really believethat Jolyne would marry me.    It's true that I've beensentenced for m*rder,    and I also know thatJolyne would never fall for me.    But the strong drive and mindthat she inherited from you    sheds light into the darkness of my heart.    She lightened my heart,which was on the verge of collapsing!    Please, I need it now.    Just one word will do.    Say you'll allow me.    Please liberate my heart.    If we make it out of this alive,allow me to marry her!    I don't understand.    Have you lost your mindfrom all this madness?    Anasui.    We need to stay together.    Everyone, don't wander off.    We made it up on the roof,but now we have nowhere to run.    Besides, he's on the move.    But I can't sense his movement.    I barricaded the area with my strings,but who knows what good it'll do?    Though the priest succeededin completing his ability,    he has no intention of letting us live.    He wants to settle his score with us.    He is determined    to settle the scorewith the Joestar bloodline.    I get it,but his Stand is too unpredictable!    How are we supposed to fight against it?    Jotaro, allow us!    Everyone, listen closely.    It may appear as if we are cornered,    but coming up to this roofgave us an advantage.    The priest's ability accelerates time.    He's the only one who can move insidethe accelerated time.    However, we can still see him.    Judging from my watch,    it takes about two minutesfor an hour to pass.    This is what it means.    If he runs at    kilometers per hour,    he'll appear as if he's movingat the speed of a b*llet train.    It sounds fast, but our eyescan observe a moving b*llet train.    Stay calm and observe.    You will be able to tellthat he's moving, at least.    Try to sense his movements.    He's    times faster than us.    A car going   kph would be  ,   kph,    and a car going    kph would be Mach  . .    Correct.    However, the priest is wary    and remains cautiousin coming to this rooftop.    He knows that I can stop time,though only for a few seconds.    There's also the unknown factor.    We don't knowwhat his ability will become.    He himself is yearning to see it evolve.    Star Platinum: The World.    Where is he?    Where did he go?    I saw something move under that table.    He's closing in on us.    I can stop time for five seconds at most.    In just five seconds,I must find him and finish him off.    Good grief, he's nowhere to be found.    Did I just imagine a flickering shadow?    Time's up.    Time will now start again…    The palm tree!    He hid behind the leaves!    What?    No way. He's using the tree's flexibility!    My ability is at its limit.Time will start again!    He'll catapult himself using the tree!    Above?    Dad…    Jolyne, behind you!    He's coming again!    Anasui.    You submerged your Stand into my body.    You took damage in my place.    You served as armorto mitigate the damage.    And yet…    It's too short.    Five seconds just isn't enough.    I can't activatemy Time Stop ability consecutively!     Once Star Platinum stops timefor five seconds,    it can't launch for a brief moment.    Our only chance to defeat the priestis for me to get in range.    And only when the time is stopped!    I'm at the limit.    Time now starts again.    Dad! Anasui!    My first target is no longer Jotaro,but Anasui.    Yes, I will finish him off first.    Listen closely.    This may be beyond your comprehension,    but I will part with this last remark.    Time will accelerate.    I did not obtain this powerto end your lives,    nor does this ability promise mesupreme strength.    This power's purpose is to guidethe human race towards true happiness.    My new Stand, my new ability.    I shall give it a name.    Made in Heaven!

My new Stand, my new ability.   I shall give it a name.   Made in Heaven!   EPISODE   : Made in Heaven ( )   You're being eliminatedfor the future I envision.   Your impending death   is merely a sacrificefor humanity to achieve happiness.   g*n ghost!   It's useless, Emporio.   sh**ting him won't do any good.   No, Jolyne.   I sh*t at the building near us!   Ermes put her sticker on the b*llet.   The b*llet is duplicated!   Emporio, you…   He's coming at us again!   Hold on tight, everyone!   No matter what, don't let go!   It's him! He's chasing us on foot!   My Stand's speed is excludedfrom the time acceleration!   He'll catch up in no time!   Emporio, put a sticker on the next b*lletand sh**t again!   We have to reach the swamp,   to the ocean!   If we're at the ocean,then we might have a chance!   The priest caught up to us!   He's getting ahead to stand in our way!   sh**t another b*llet,and change our direction, Emporio!   It's the ocean!I see the rocks in the swamp!   Aim the next sh*t atthose protruding rocks!   He's coming for us again!   He's simply too fast!   Listen closely.He's moving with accelerated time,   but one Stand is all he's got!   Plus, its combat strengthis above average at best!   He can only att*ck one of us at a time.   That's the key to our victory.   Jotaro, I'll send you a signalthe moment I get att*cked.   Seize that opportunity to stop timeand finish him off!   The moment his att*ck hits me,that's when you stop the time.   Do you understand?   Don't do it before I'm hit,it has to be after.   It'll be a split of a second.   You must be absolutely precise.   Grab him and end his life.   Our only chance is your Star Platinum!   Wait a minute.   We're doing what?   I don't understand.   Smart plan, Anasui.   Although he proclaimedthat you are his first target,   that may not be the case.   It would make most senseif he targeted me first.   No, I've already submerged Diver Downinto your body,   so that it can protect youfrom the inside.   You're not the only one.   Jolyne, Emporio, and Ermes too.   Diver Down has submerged into everyonegiven our close distance.   In other words, no matterwho gets att*cked first,   Diver Down will feel the damage.   What?   You will sense my signalinternally through Diver Down.   Remember, don't stop timeuntil after I'm hit.   Anasui, you're willingto trade your life for his!   That's absurd!   His next att*ck will be deadly!   Maybe so.   But maybe I can signal Jotarobefore the blow kills me?   I've been lucky recently.   Wouldn't you say so, Emporio?   I've been lucky since the jailbreak.At least I haven't d*ed yet!   If I actually live through this,I might even ask Jolyne to marry me!   I'm just saying.   That's fine by me.   That's fine, Anasui.   Ask me to marry you.   I'm not saying thatbecause I'm in despair at our situation.    Your idea carries hope.There's no darkness there.    We may only have one chance.    If there's even a glimpse of hope there,    then I know it's the correct path for us.    There he is!    He's already on that rock! Emporio!    Get close to me!    You need to be closer!    He's coming!    Approaching from the right!    Brace yourselves!    This makes sense. The water gives him awayand tells us his position.    Not yet, Jotaro.    Don't stop time yet.    If you miss him, it's over.    You absolutely have to grab him!    Feel my signal from within.    Oh… wait.    See that? Look at the clouds!    They're zooming by like rockets!    And what exactly is going on?    The sky is brighter to the east!    Why? It's still too early!    It should take two or three minutesfor an hour to pass!    That means it takes    to    minutesfor the night to pass.    I don't believe this!    The sun is risingat an unbelievable speed!    Time is accelerating faster than before!    Around the world, birds are flyingat their normal speed.    Similarly, insects and plantshaven't changed their speed.    Flowers aren't blooming faster,nor are they wilting in an instant.    Look closely.    I have a glass cup in my hand.    When the cup is in my hand,nothing happens to it.    But the moment I let go,    the cup falls faster than we can see.    It's shattered on the groundbefore we realize it.    The only logical explanationis the acceleration of time!    Everything in the universe isaccelerating except for living things!    This is all my assistants' fault!    I'm the top-selling manga artist!    A genius like me drawingno more than one page a night?    That's absurd!    The ink dries beforeI can draw a single line!    What in the world am I supposed to do?    Hello?    What? One artist is stillmeeting deadlines?    Who is he?    Who the hell is he?    It's Rohan Kishibe.    What?    I can't see the wavesbecause of the accelerated time!    We can't tell where he is!    Where will he ambush us from?    Get ready!    Stone Ocean!    Kiss!    Jotaro, hold off on your ability.    Wait for my signal!    Now! Stop the time--    Star Platinum: The World!    You're mine!    Meet your end, Pucchi--    How is this possible?    Pucchi made Jolyne's Standatt*ck Anasui!    I'm one step behind!    Four seconds left.    If I don't k*ll him now,    he'll vanishin the accelerated time again.    It'll be over if time starts again!    I must end this fightbefore time restarts!    Three seconds left.    Two seconds!    Knives, suspended in air!    The priest had already thrown the knives,just as Dio once did!    You were two steps behind.    STAND NAME: Made in HeavenSTAND MASTER: ENRICO PUCCHI    The Joestar family,through their bloodline,    have seized victories bydrawing strength from honor and courage.    However!    Your bloodline is also your weakness.    Jotaro Kujo,your weakness is your daughter.    Dad…    Jolyne…    I stole a car…    on the way home from school…    at a supermarket parking lot…    I stole a car… Why did I do that?    But… I knew that you'd come and save me.    You'd do whatever it takes… to save me…    Dad, you…    I must bring all loose ends to a close.    I do not feel remorse,nor can I let you run freely.    I must settle every matter.    After all, I am the onewho k*lled your mother.    Emporio.    Yes, sh**t.    At least you may die a martyr's death.    Your fate ends here, Emporio!    Jolyne Kujo!    Ah!    Joestar!    Do you think you can escape me?    You swim even slower than you run.    Jolyne!    I caught a dolphin with Stone Ocean.    Yes, time may be accelerating,but living things are unaffected.    Now, Father Pucchi…you're against this speed!    How long will it take for you to catch up?    The distance is at play here.    Had we been closer,you may have been able to catch up.    But how far can you swim?    Is it     meters, or    ?    Can you stay underwater    and swim longer than a dolphinwithout letting out?    Time acceleration doesn't affect    the distance you can swim,or the stamina that you have!    Moreover, can you swim this distanceback to shore without drowning?    You will not escape!    I shall end your life!    I refuse to carry this feudinto the future!    Jolyne, the rope!    Hurry, come to the dolphin!    Emporio…    Because Anasui sacrificed himselfto protect my father,    I'm still alive, though barely.    Because Ermes gave her lifeto att*ck the priest,    I had enough timeto grab onto the dolphin.    When a dolphin lets a human rideon its back,    it swims to shorein the safest way possible.    Hurry, please!    Come!    Why is the rope getting longer?    That dolphin will take you to safety.I know it will.    What are you saying? Hurry and join me!    Emporio, I can't join you.    The priest can sense the Joestar in me.    No matter where I go, I sense him,and he senses me to track me down.    If I'm with you, you can't get away.    Emporio, you have to facethe path that lies ahead alone.    But don't worry.    I know you can finishwhat we set out to do.    Those who wished for your escapewere Anasui, Ermes,    and my father, Jotaro Kujo.    You have to survive. You are our hope.    I told you, I don't understand!    No, you can't…    Stop, wait! Jolyne!    No!    Pull the rope!    He ought to be tired out by now.    I'll hold him off!    Face me, Father Pucchi!    Stone Ocean!    Jolyne!    What's that in the sky?    Could that be the sun?    It's already morning!    The sun isn't round.It looks like it's stretching out!    The needles on my watch vanished…    No, it's ticking so fast,I can't see them with my eyes!    It's night time again.    Morning!    It's night again!    What's happening?    It's accelerating.    Time is accelerating even more!    Oh, damn!    We need canned foods!    Raw foods are rotting away.    Hoard whatever canned food you can find!    We're running out of food!    Dust is collecting!The window frames are rusting!    My implants!    I just got these done the other day!    What is happening to the sky?    Where's the sun?    Is that gleaming light the sun?    Is it night, or is it day?What year are we in?    What is today's date?    I feel cold.    The seasons are changing!    What is that?    The waves are eroding the rocks away!    Is there no way to stoptime from accelerating?    How much more?    Is there an end to this?    The land formation changed!    Where am I?    There are only live organisms here!    I can't breathe…    What the hell? Why are you naked here?    Huh? But I was just…    Hurry up!    Put your jumpsuits on!    Why don't I have clothes on?    Wait… what was I doing?Time got faster and I…    Crap! I'm on camera!    It's going to get misunderstood!    This is…    This place…    I know where this is!    This is Green Dolphin Street Prison!    This is the hallwayby the visitation room!
05x38 - What a Wonderful WorldQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:44This place…  This is Green Dolphin Street Prison!  This is the hallwayby the visitation room!  What the hell do you want?  I don't want to see your face.  It's too late to comeand try to act like a father!  I want to help you.  I'll get you out of here shortly.  Shut up.   You know you can't.   I'll serve this two-year sentencefor that hit-and-run and then be released.   Calm down. I've always thought of you--   That's a blatant lie.It's too late to play father figure now.   Now leave!   Who are these two?   They look so similar…   to the Joestars!   But it's not them.   Leave! I can't get along with you.   What is going on?   Wasn't I at Cape Canaveral?   And what's going on?   What year am I in?   It's     , November   th.   Pucchi!   Who the hell are you?   Even a priest isn't allowedto disrupt a visitation--   It's     ?   Did time rewind?   On the contrary.   We leapt through   to the ultimate timebeyond the acceleration.   We went beyond the end of our universe.   The ending of one universe brings aboutthe beginning of the next.   This is an inevitable truth,and in the forthcoming universe,   the Earth is created, and living thingsexperience a life similar to the previous.   The human race went beyond the endand now faces the dawn of a new start.   This is the new world   Made in Heaven has promised!   What are you saying?   There's no Jolyne Cujoh in this world.   Neither are there Jotaro,Anasui, or Ermes.   Even their souls ceased to exist.   The dead cannot be brought over.   Those who lost their livesduring the time acceleration   have been weeded out of the cycle.   I left behind all my enemiesin the prior universe.   Except for you, Emporio!   You should not have made it over.   You must be ended, here and now!   EPISODE   : IT'S A WONDERFUL WORLD   Code    . Security Level  .   Visitation room door alarm activated.   Code    . Security Level  .   What's going on?   Who knows, but now's our chance. Let's go.   They're leaving the roomjust like Jolyne and Jotaro did.   They're different people,but the same thing is happening!   This is fate.   This universe   has been through the same historyas that of the prior world.   It will remain in the same course.   Fate is brought on by necessity,not chance.   Now, you're going totry to find refuge in your room.   I'm talking about your old secret room   that you used to hide inback in the prior world.   Your next actionsare written in your destiny.   I have to go somewhereother than the ghost room!   How did prisoners get insidethe general area?   Who knows? Just run.   Those guards are from earlier.   They're going to trip over.   What is it?   -We'll trip over.-What?   We keep running in this direction,and we'll trip over ourselves horribly.   Huh? What the hell are you on about?   That's odd. Why did I think of that?   I don't know, it just came to me.We're going to trip over.   Are you chickening out?   If we don't hurry, they'll cut our pay!   -Why?-Right!   For some reason, I know.   Those two are about to…   Father!   -What's the matter?-Move.   No one can escape fate.   You will escape to that room.   What exactly is going on?   We leapt through   to the ultimate timebeyond the acceleration.   We went beyond the end of our universe.   The end of our universe?   I've read it in a book once.   How the universe begins and ends.   From the moment it is born,a universe infinitely expands.   But at a certain point in time,it begins to contract.   Like a stress ball being squeezed,   there's a point of singularitywhere it can no longer contract.   That marks the end of the universe.    The force leads to a Big Bang,forming a brand new universe.    Did we come from our world to this one?    Did we travel through Earth's historyat an incredible speed,    and now we're in the new     ?    But not everyone made it.    The dead cannot be brought over.    Those who lost their livesduring the time acceleration    have been weeded out of the cycle.    They're gone.    Jolyne and everyone,they're not part of this world.    I've become alone again.    Blessed are those who leapt through time.    They've experienced everythingthat is to come    and have arrived in this new universe.    This is the worldwhere fate is predestined.    Fate will repeat itself.    When people meet, it's like gravity.    Fate dictates one to meet another.    For example,what lies five years in the future?    Having gone through the accelerated time,    we know what will happen.    When do accidents happen,and when do we fall ill?    When will our life end?    When do we meet, and when do we part?    When and who do we love and hate?    When do we have children,and what lies in their future?    When do wars break out,and when does a new era begin?    As if watching a movie,the future events play out in our minds.    So shall it be for our children,and their posterity!    The time acceleration startedat Cape Canaveral.    Every living being thatlived through this acceleration    can recall the future.    It won't be with their mind or body,but with their soul!    And that in itself isthe meaning of happiness,    because now,we can prepare for the future.    Blessed are those who prepared!    One may say that to learn ofa bleak future will bring despair.    I say otherwise.    Should you die tomorrow,    the mere knowledge ofwhat is to come brings peace.    Preparation overcomes despair.    Humanity will evolve.    This is the path to heavenDio and I sought to achieve!    This is Made in Heaven.    The g*n! My g*n!    I dropped it in the ocean!    If I turn right and go down the stairs,I'll get to my ghost room.    But Pucchi already knowsabout the secret room.    I shouldn't turn right.    I'll turn left and find another place.    Some details may vary,but you cannot change fate.    Your only optionis to escape into that cr*ck.    Suppose I spare your lifeand you go off on your way.    Eventually, you will stand against me.    That's the destined future.    I must eliminate you here and now.    Even without Jolyne,you'll break out of here.    Fate dictates that I lose youat Cape Canaveral.    But here in this prison,before the acceleration starts,    I know exactly what you'll do.    This is my chanceto eradicate an opposing force.    Hence, I slowed time down on this date.    Prepare to meet your end.    Bracing for the inevitablebrings joy, Emporio.    You are our hope!    Your death shall serve humanity!    Die now, Emporio!    Fate is predestined and can't be changed?    Then…    I'll let you change my fate.    Your arm inserted it into my headwhen you punched me into the cr*ck.    When you k*lled Weather,    he extracted his ability,Weather Report, in a disc.    Jolyne wanted me to have it.    She gave me this disc!    Perish in the name of God!    Emporio, your futile actions…    You've merely turned your screamsinto the trumpets of hell!    Yes, the ability is now yours.    However, Weather was skilledin using his power!    It's not an ability you can masterby simply inserting it in your head!    And now!    Time…    accelerates once again!    Learn your feeble place, Emporio…    in the face of my grand purpose!    What?    What is the meaning of this?    I cannot… stand!    Something is terribly wrong.    What is this?    Weather Report!    I read it in a book once.    Oxygen is the most prevalent toxinthat surrounds living organisms.    Yes, living beings need oxygen to live,    but it can't surpass   % saturation.    Pure oxygen is highly toxic.    Organisms will dieif they are exposed to it!    In high concentrations, oxygen causessteel to rust within seconds.    It causes fire to combust,    and robs human cells of electrons!    It destroys the body's organ systemsone at a time!    Inhale pure oxygen,and your limbs will become paralyzed.    Soon, you lose the ability to stand.    The veins in the eyes burst,causing blindness.    Acceleration of time is irrelevant.    Weather Report is an abilitythat manipulates weather.    I was already filling this roomwith pure oxygen.    Gradually, you'll lose consciousness.    Pure oxygen will seep into your organs.    Pesky brat…    I'm not controlling this Stand.    This is Weather's ability you sealed away.    First, you stole Weather's memories.    Then you awakened this poweralong with the snail metamorphosis.    Pucchi, you caused your own demise.    Gravity brings one to another.    You couldn't cut this forceout of your life!    Stop this, Emporio!    Stop Weather!    Don't make him do this!    I finally attained the will of God!    It is God's will that I use my ability!    With the beginning of the new universe,humanity can be saved at last!    In this world,we haven't reached Cape Canaveral,    where I acquired time acceleration.    Made in Heaven is still incomplete.    I will gladly offer my lifeafter Cape Canaveral.    If I die,    everything I've accomplishedwill be undone!    You will change humanity's fate!    Then people will no longer knowwhat will happen in the future,    and they won't be able toprepare for the inevitable.    Remember,preparation brings true happiness!    I refuse to die here!    Don't you understand?    You've already been defeated by fate.    Stop talking nonsense, child!    Realize that I didn't do this alone.    You've also been defeated by Jolyne,who sent me here.    Weather.    F.F.    Ermes.    Anasui.    And even Jotaro.    They didn't know what lies ahead,but they all had resolve.    You're the one who's unprepared, Pucchi!    Walking the path of justiceis fate itself!    Stop this now!    Stop spewing nonsenseas if you understand!    You insignificant brat!    It's a bus.    Like I said,    I only have    dollars!    What kind of bus doesn't have change?    What?    -Is that how you talk to a customer?-Good, the bus stopped.    All right, give me a moment.    I'll break it for some changeat the gas station.    Hey kid, are you getting on this bus?    Good timing, got any spare change on you?    I need to break this   -dollar bill.    Please?    It's not counterfeit.    What? Hey!    Wait up, jerk!    He tossed my bag out, dammit!    The bus left becauseyou were taking your time!    The next bus is in two hours.What am I going to do?    You listening?    Dammit.    Whatever.    Maybe he thoughtI was a Green Dolphin jailbreak.    You're…    What?    Hey. My car's out of gas.    If you pay for my gas and meals,I'll take you anywhere.    What do you say, kid?    That how you pinch trip money?    My sis always saidnot to ride with a stranger.    See, a storm is coming.    You're free to test your luck    and see if you can stay dryuntil the next bus.    Hop in, kid. We won't bite.    I'm Irene.    He's Anakiss.    Where are your parents?    We're going to see my father.    This guy is…    my boyfriend.    Who knows how Father will react,but if he gives us his blessing,    we might get married.    Damn, you sure about the storm?    Ten dollars is all you're getting from me,    and make a stop at Cape Canaveral,got that?    Hop in. I can use your help.    Honestly, it helps me too.    Are you okay, kid?    What's your name?    Don't be shy. Hop on.    We won't ask for money.    You're shaking.    Are you cold?    Here.    I'm…    Emporio.    That's my name.    My name… is Emporio.    Look, a hitchhiker.    No more. Two is enough.    You said the storm is coming.    Stop the car, we can't leave him.    JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE - STONE OCEANTHE END
