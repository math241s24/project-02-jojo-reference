02x02 - Who Will Be the Judge!?QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:24Previously on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Come out. We're going home.  Get lost.  I didn't ask for you.  You'll "help"?  Say hello to my friend.We met in Egypt three years ago.  His name is Avdol.  Red Bind!  This is...   Allow me to tell you what it is!   It is an evil spirit, yet it is not.   Jotaro! What you call an evil spirit   is a powerful apparition,created from your own life energy.   What stands next to you, is...   a Stand!   That's a hundred-year-old coffinpulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,   off the African coast four years ago.   Coffin?   I did my research, and foundit was on the passenger ship   where my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar,   your great-great grandfather, was k*lled.   Apparently it was emptywhen they discovered it.   But I know what lay inside!   Avdol and I are trying tolocate him as we speak.   He's evil incarnate!   And his name is Dio!   Awakened after a century of sleep.   And it's our destiny to fight this man!   Take a look at the back of his neck!   Below this bastard scum's neck,   is the body of my grandfather,Jonathan Joestar!    KUJO   Jotaro! Wait!   You forgot something!   Goodness...   Here, a goodbye kiss.   Smooch.   Annoying bitch...   Quit being so freakin clingy, will ya?   Okay! Have a good day!   Good grief...   Hey, it's Jojo.   What? Jojo?   You're right! It's Jojo!   -Jojo!-Jojo!   Good morning, Jojo.   -Jojo!-Good morning, Jojo.   Jojo, what were you doingtaking four days off from school?   Hey!   Just what do you think you're doing?   He doesn't like you like that! Back off!   What's your problem, ugly?   Shut up, no-boobs.   -Ugly.-No-boobs.   Shut up! You're pissing me off!   He actually spoke to me!   No, he spoke to me!   Jojo, wait!   Wait for us!   -Jojo!-Jojo!   What?   -Jojo!-Jojo!   The branches...   Jojo!   Oh, no!   Jojo fell down the steps!   Oh, but he's still moving!   Thank God the branches broke his fall!   Did a branch just slice open my knee?   No...   It was there before the fall!   That's why I missed the step. I know it.   But...   Jojo!   Are you all right?   Oh?   I see his Stand has great power.   No wonder...   the Master wants him dead.   No matter...   He is no match for my Stand.    EPISODE TWO:WHO WILL BE THE JUDGE?    You really scared me.    -Are you okay, Jojo?-Are you okay, Jojo?   That was lucky.   Fifteen centimeters more,and you'd have hit the pavement.   People slip on these steps all the time.   From now on, we'd betterhold hands going down, Jojo.   You...   Your left leg appears to be bleeding.   Here, you can use this handkerchiefto clean yourself up.   Are you all right?   I'll be just fine.   Hold it.   Thanks.   I don't recognize you.Do you go to this school?   Noriaki Kakyoin.   I just transferred here yesterday.   Nice to meet you.    -Huh...-Huh…    So he's Kakyoin, huh? He's kinda cute.    Really?    I like Jojo more.    -Me, too.-Me, too.    -What?-What are you talking about?    -Give it up.-I'm the best for Jojo.    Back then, I was weak...    I had no body.    If I hadn't stolen Jonathan Joestar's...    If it hadn't been for his energy,negligiable as it was,    I couldn't have survived that century    at the bottom of the sea.    But this body is an expression ofthe bond between parent and child.    It seems to tie me toJonathan's descendants.    They know of my presence.    Jonathan's body has given mea new power...    The Stand!    It reaches out tothe flesh of his progeny.    Alas, with it come advantagesand disadvantages.    They are two sides ofthe same coin. Such is life.    I must eliminate them...    The Joestar clan must be exterminated.    Damnit, this room is so cramped!    This is why I hate Japan.    Avdol, how can you stand this?    I find it quite fascinating...    the "Way of Tea."    "Way of Tea", my ass.    Instant coffee will do just fine!    Speaking of Dio...    Mr. Joestar, as long aswe can sense his existence,    we must assume he can sense ours.    Indeed.    But if we don't know his next move,or even what his powers may be...    Japanese coffee is awful!    It's from America.    Jojo, how did you get that cut?    Don't tell me. You got intoanother fight, didn't you?    And take off that hat!    It's rude!    For pity's sake...    Come on Doc, has Jojoever gotten hurt in a fight?    Yeah, think about it.    Yeah!    I suppose you're right.    Okay, I'll believe you fell down,your grace.    Hey, hold on.    What are you going to do?    I'm going to cut off your pants.    Quit joking around.    Well, I can't treat you otherwise.    I'll take them off.    You'll ruin a perfectly goodpair of paints.    Who knew you were such a cheapskate.    And while Jojo does that,    I'll take your temperaturesso I can prove you're faking.    No, we've got colds.    Let us go home early.    Nope!    Whoops.    What is this?     JOTARO KUJO, TODAY, YOU DIE AT THE HANDOF MY STAND! NORIAKI KAKYOIN    Kakyoin?    Hey... Doctor!    What are you doing?    Can't you see?    I'm shaking out thermometer for you.    Thermometer? Doc...    Doc, that's a pen!    A pen? A pen you say?    Does this look like a pen to you?    What imbeciles you boys are!    You actually thinkthis thermometer is a pen?    Why don't you take...    a closer...    look!    She's...    NORIAKI KAKYOIN    My eye! My eye!    Jojo...    You aren't going to tell me    this looks like a pen, too, are you?    This upper body strength...    She's no ordinary nurse.    I saw something weirdcrawl up from the floor.    Was it a Stand?    Noriaki Kakyoin...    Did he cut my leg on the stairs, too?    Bingo.    You're...    So we meet again.    I've attached my Stand to the doctor.    She is under my control now.    att*ck my Stand,and you'll injure her, Jojo.    You bastard... Who the hell are you?    I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.    My Stand's name is Hierophant Green.    And while I am human,I pledged my loyalty to him...    Which is why...    I have to k*ll you!    I'm not letting you harm her.    Now that I've dragged it out... I see…    it's nothing more thana pathetic parasite.    Kakyoin, this your Stand?    Kinda reminds me ofa fat, shiny, green melon.    You're going to regretdragging that out of her, Jojo.    Cut the bravado.    From the looks of your forehead,    I'm about to smash    two melons at once.    For now, I'm gonna keepa grip on you for a bit.    I'll take you to the Old Man.    I'm sure he'll be pleased to meet you...    Besides, I'd like to know moreabout Dio myself.    What?    What's this green stuff drippingfrom his Stand's hands?    I already told you, Jojo...    You will regret this.    Get ready for my Stand,Hierophant Green's...    Enough foul play!    Emerald Splash!    What do you think?    Emerald Splash...    What you thought was green ooze,    is the destructive energyHierophant Green controls!    It pierced your Stand's chest.    So you must be bleeding internally.    You and that nurse...    What?    But how? I pulled the Stand out of her...    I told you...    Attacking Hierophant hurts her.    My Stand can travel farther than yours,    though it prefers closed-in spaces.    It particularly enjoys hiding from sight.    Pull it out, however,and you'll witness its wrath.    That's why it tore her throat to shreds.    It's your fault, Jojo!    You're responsible!    It's all because of you, Jojo!    This is your doing!    If you would have just let me k*ll you,    she would be perfectly fine now.    You're trying to stand up?    How sad...    You look like a sorry punching bag,    awaiting your next thrashing.    It's true: I, Jotaro Kujo,have been called a delinquent.    And it's true that I tend to b*atthe crap out my opponents.    Some are still in the hospital.    I've also put cocky teachersin their places,    so much so that some never come back.    And I make it a policyto stiff restaurants    that serve crappy, over-priced food.    But...    even a guy like me...    can spot evil when he see's it.    Evil is when you usethe weak for your own gain,    and then stomp on them when it's over.    And that's what you've done.    To a young lady, even!    Your Stand hides from its victimsand the law. But...    I will be your judge!    Evil?    You have it all wrong.    The loser is evil.    The victor is righteous.    Whoever survives to tell the tale!    The end justifies the means!    The loser is the evil one.    And now, the final blow!    What? The loser is the evil one?    Emerald Splash!    Well, in that case...    What?    Impossible!He deflected my Emerald Splash!    ...let's see just how evil you are!    The judge will be...    my Stand!    What power...    You caught me off guard back there.    I'm glad my Stand's strong,    but I get the sense it's growingmore and more savage by the day.    That was close.    A little tender loving care,and the Doc should be as good as new.    What was that? A gas expl*si*n?    It came from the nurse's office!    Everyone stay put!    They can take over from here.    I'm taking the day off.    This guy has some explaining to do.About Dio...     HIEROPHANT GREENNORIAKI KAKYOIN    At this very moment, my Jotaro mustbe thinking about me at school!    It must be that psychic connectionbetween mother and son.    It's not.    Jotaro!    What about school? And who is that?    He's covered in blood!    Did you...    Stay out of this.    Where's the Old Man?    And why does this househave to be so freakin big?    I think your grandfather'sin the tea room, with Avdol.    Oh, Jotaro...    You never want to talk to me anymore.    I...    worry about you so much.    But I can see right through you!    Deep down, you're a sweet boy.    -Hey.-Yes?    You're looking a little pale today.    You okay?    Yay! Fine, thank you!    I knew it.    It doesn't look good. It's too late.    We can't save him.    I give him a few days.    Jotaro, it's not your fault.    Look.    Do you know why he choseto obey Dio, even to k*ll?    The culprit...    is here!    The hell?    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    This isn't good at all... At this rate…    Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.    I don't really understand, either.    This is the one thing I feared most!    Tell me how we should deal with this!
