02x10 - The Emperor and the Hanged Man, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:31Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore...  So the Indian leg of our journeyis finally upon us...  But, well, I'm a little worried.  I've always heard Indiais the land of curry  and rampant disease.  I'm worried my stomach won'tbe able to handle the culture gap.  That assessment is rather distorted.  You needn't worry.  It is a beautiful countrywith wonderful people.   That I assure you.   Well, this is Calcutta. Let's get going.   Hey, give me a tip!   Let me carry that for you!   Want a tattoo? You're very pretty.   Need some anti-venom?It won't hurt your stomach.   Let me show you my hotel!   Calcutta, India.   In the   th century,its population reached    million.   Calcutta buzzes with a bustling energy   that will pull you inand never let you go!   -I stepped in a pile of cow sh*t!-I don't need any.   -Damn it!-I don't need any.   -Somebody's already stolen my wallet!-Seriously, thank you, but no!   Tip! Tip! Tip!   If you don't give me a tip,you won't go to heaven, sir.   Hey! Don't rub your noseall over my stuff!   Avdol! So this is India?   See? Great country, isn't it?   They're what make India great,don't you think?    EPISODE TEN: THE EMPERORAND THE HANGED MAN, PART ONE   Here, try this.   This is chai.   I think you'll find it to your liking.   Chai.   One of India's most popular drinks.   A sweet concoction of   black tea, sugar, ginger, and milk.   At last, a little peace.   Be patient with India.   Once you get used to it, you'll seehow wonderful this country is.   You know, I kinda like this place.It's pretty cool.   What, Jotaro? You can't be serious?   Talk about culture shock.   Guess I'll like itonce I get used to it, huh?   Well, I suppose people adapt totheir surroundings eventually.   Where's the john?   Right over there, sir.   Polnareff.   Yeah?   What do you want to eat?   Pick for me.   It'd better be something amazing.   Something gorgeous and sophisticated   that suits a Frenchman like moi.   Which means it doesn't matter.   Let's see, something he'll like...   Excuse me.   Pardon me, sir, one moment...   Huh?   If you could please use this.   What's this wooden stick for?   Hey.   That's a weird looking toilet,but at least it's clean.   A gentleman like myself simplycannot tolerate a dirty bathroom.   Sir, is something wrong?   Don't "Is something wrong?" me!   The toilet...   The toilet...   There's a pig in the toilet!   This kind of toilet is rare even in India.   The builders constructedthe pig pen down below   higher than they were supposed to.   So when the pigs gets hungry,they come up for more.   That's not what I'm aski...   No, wait, what?   You're telling me this pig's food is...   That's what it's there for?   As I mentioned, sir, use this.   Here...   See? Now you can do your businesswhile the pig's knocked down.   Our manager gets the pigto lick his buttocks   and always sings his praises.   He gets it so clean.   Please, take your time.   Wait! Don't leave me in here alone!   I don't think I could everget used to this...   Guess I'll hold ittill we get to the hotel.   Sorry to keep you waiting.   Crap.   Where is he?   Weird... I could've swornI saw someone out there.   Must've been my imagination.   Guess I shouldn't be surprised.   I mean, I did just see a pig in the john.   Of course I'd imaginea monster in the window.   So this is what they meanby culture shock here.   What?   What the hell?   I can see this damn thingonly in the mirror!    This must be the mirror StandJotaro was talking about.    This is not good.    This is so not good!    Silver Chariot!    Where'd that bastard go?    Damn it!    Stand!    Where's the user? Who is it?    The man with two right hands...    Too many people...    Damn it!    What's wrong, Polnareff?    What is this about?    If that...    If that was a Stand, then that means...    Then that means he's here!    Jotaro! It's the Stand useryou heard about—    the one who uses the mirrors!    The bastard who k*lled my sister!    The scum who heartlessly trampled    my sister's life, soul, and dignity.    Finally... Finally we meet!    Are you sure it's him?    Mr. Joestar, I'll be travelingon my own from here on out.    What?    With my sister's m*rder*rfinally within reach,    I'll be damned if I'm going towait for him to come after me.    It would put me at a disadvantage,and that's just not my style.    I'll find him first and k*ll him!    But we don't even know what he looks like,    or what his Stand is.    He's got two right hands,that's enough for me!    And he knows I'm after him,    so he'll be on the defensive.    See ya.    Tough talk from a manwho's digging his own grave.    And that means?    Just as it sounds, my friend.    Are you trying to say I can't win?    Yes.    Can't you see?The enemy att*cked to isolate you!    I won't let you go it alone, Polnareff.    Listen. Let me make one thing clear:    I never once gave a damn about Dio.    I told you in Hong Kong I'd tag alongso I could get my revenge.    Mr. Joestar and Jotaro already know this.    I've been alone from the start!    I've always been fighting alone!    You selfish fool!    Did you forget that Dio brainwashed you?    Did you forget thathe's the root of all this?    You have no idea how it feelsto have your sister m*rder*d!    I heard the last time you met Dio,    you ran like a dog withhis tail between his legs!    A coward like you would neverunderstand why I need to do this!    What did you say?    Don't touch me.    You got lucky that dayyou b*at me in Hong Kong.    Enough with this lecturing!    How dare you...    Oh, did that offend you?    Don't forget...    I'm a hell of a lot more pissed offthan you right now!    You can just keep being yourself,    with your holierthan thou attitude, Avdol.    Why, you!    Mr. Joestar!    That's enough. Just let him go.    No one can stop him now.    I've lost all respect for him, that's all.    My impression of him was completely wrong.    I did indeed run in fear from him.    But I'm certain that foresightwill let us win.    Rushing in without thinkingwill get us all k*lled.    Oh?    Then I'll say this with certainty, too.    Your little divination will be wrong.    Time to get off.    I'm here to see a friend of mine.    You're on your own from here.    Please, make me your wife.    My life will belong to you.    Just say whatever you wish of me, my love.    Please, let me stay by your side forever.    Baby, don't be stupid.You're still sixteen.    I'm old enough to marry.    I love you.    Listen. I'm just a no-good drifter, baby.    I live each day like it's my last,and one day, it will be my last.    You have royal blood.    We can't have a fairy-tale marriage.    No matter how much we love each other.    Really?    So you do love me?    Yep. You're my one and only, hun.    That's exactly why...    It's 'cause I love youthat we can't marry.    You understand, don't you?    This breaks my heart just asmuch as it breaks yours.    But I'll come back to see you andhold you like this whenever I can.    That's enough to make me happy.    Yes...    So long. Love ya, darling.    You know, it's bad manners to eavesdrop.    You think I spend too much timeon romance, don't ya?    When you've got girls like her allover the world at your beck and call...    you've always got a partner, an ally.    They'd do anything for me,even throw away their own lives.    You are aware of how I work, aren't you,    Mr. Centerfold?    By the way, about this Polnareffof the Silver Chariot.    Seems he left the group andis looking for you on his own.    What do you wanna do?    He totally fell for your plan,hook, line, and sinker.    Shall we go and k*ll him first?    Let's go.    Between your Hanged Man and my Emperor,    I have no doubt we can k*ll 'em all.    HANGED MANCENTERFOLD    So he really did leave us after all.    What?    You've seen him?    You sure you saw a manwith two right hands?    Where?    Huh?    I don't understand. He was right there.    What?    There, he was with that man in the street.    The g*n is mightier than the sword.    Not bad, if I do say so myself.    Who the hell are you?    Hol Horse. That's what they call me.    I'm a Stand user,and my card is the Emperor.    I've been paid good moneyby Dio to rub you guys out.    Look here, cowboy, I don't givea rat's ass who you say you are.    Where's the man with two right hands?    That was rude.You asked who I am, so I answered.    Well, whatever.    I came here with that guy.    He's nearby.    What?    Where is he?     There's really no pointin your asking that.     I, Hol Horse, will havethe pleasure of snuffing you out.     Morons like you always talk trash,     and it always ends upthe other way around.     Oh? Was that funny?     Lord Dio had you pegged:     "Polnareff has the fatal habit ofunderestimating his opponents.     b*ating him into a corpsewon't be any trouble for you."    He was exactly right,so I couldn't help but laugh.    If I have to take you out to get to him,    then that's exactly what I'll do.    Bring it.    Ever heard of m*llitary chess?    The t*nk is stronger than the soldier,    and tanks are weak against mines.    See, it's pretty muchthe basics of battle.     My Emperor is stronger than you,so I thought I'd be a gentleman.     I'll fill you in on my Stand'sabilities before we fight.     The g*n is mightier than the sword.    Such a brilliant quote.    What are you trying to say, exactly?    That I have a Stand that sh**t.    And a sword simply can't b*at that.    So, what? A pea sh**t?    -Prepare to die!-Prepare to die!    You underestimated me, Polnareff!    And now, you're dead!    If I take off my armor...    I can knock down a b*llet!    What?    That's impossible! It bypassed my sword!    Oh crap!    The b*llet is also my Stand.    And that cocky attitudejust cost you your life!    Polnareff!    Wha... Avdol!    I came here becauseI was worried about you,    and what do I find?    Your ego will bethe end of you, Polnareff.    You were worried about me?    Damn you!You came here to lecture me again?    The enemy already knowseverything about you!    You said you're a loner,    but from now on,you can't win on your own!    What bad timing foran outsider to interfere.    Out of the way, Polnareff!The b*llet's coming back!    Magician's Red!    I'll melt it down!    Damn that Avdol!He went after Polnareff himself.    Where are you, Mr. Avdol? Polnareff?    I have a terrible feeling...    Hey, there's a weird fightgoing on over there.    The puddle...    What?    Mr. Avdol!    Man, today must be my day.    My g*n and Centerfold's mirrorare weak against Aldol's fire    I figured Avdol would bethe toughest one to k*ll.    Talk about luck!    Looks like no more threatsin this game of m*llitary chess!    Mr. Avdol!    He's just hurt...    It's just a minor wound.    See? He's going to start speaking...    He'll open his eyes in a moment.    Right, Mr. Avdol?    You're going to wake up, right?    Mr. Avdol, you gotta wake up!    Please! Mr. Avdol!    That seemed awfully easy.    It was too quick!    That's what he gets for lecturing people.    Look at him now.    What did you say, Polnareff?    Mr. Avdol was worried about you!    Who asked him for help?     He likes to meddlein other people's business,     but he's slow as hell, so they got him.    Guys like him just get in the way...    That's why I said I was going it alone.    You bastard...    He saved your life. How dare you...    I am sick of it!    Having people up and die on me...    Polnareff...    I'm so sick of it, you hear me!    He's got a bold face,and yet he d*ed so easily.    Come to think of it,she was really good at sobbing...    Your sister, that is.    Are you telling me to hold back?    Don't fall for the enemy's provocation!    Mr. Avdol told younot to fight by yourself!
