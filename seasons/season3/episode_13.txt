02x13 - Wheel of FortuneQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:33Now with a new set of wheels,  Jojo and crew leavethe holy city of Varanasi  for Pakistan.  We're about to hitthe Indo-Pakistani border...  I guess it's time tosay good bye to India.  You know, I had mixed feelingsabout the country at first,  but now I sorta miss the hustleand bustle of Calcutta,  and frenetic chaos of the Ganges.  One day, I'll be back.   I owe it to Avdolto give him a proper burial.   Mr. Avdol...   The road's getting narrower.   Quit clogging up the road! Outta the way!   I'm gonna pass him!   Polnareff, calm down!   This four-wheel drive is great!   Hey, did you just flinga bunch of rocks into that car?   Yeah? Your point?   Another incidentis the last thing we need right now.   I'm wanted becauseof what happened in Varanasi.   I'd like to cross the border in one piece.   What now, Polnareff?   I just told you!We can't afford another mishap!   I know that!Look who's standing over there!   Good grief...   Hey! We meet again.   How 'bout a ride?    I mean, come on, I'm a girl.    Soon I'll be wearing a bra,and doing my nails for the boys.   I'd look pathetic wandering aroundthe world when I'm that age.   It's now or never! The time is now!   To see the world... To be free...   Don't ya think?   Look, I feel bad for lying aboutgoing to see my dad in Singapore,   but let's just forget that.   Hey, it's the car we passed.   Guess he's in a hurry now.   Let him pass.   Yeah...   Hey, now!   What's he trying to do?   I let you pass,now hurry up and go already!   He's probably mad fromyour little maneuver earlier.   Catch the driver's face?   Nope... Windows were covered in dust.   Couldn't see a thing.   Me neither...   It couldn't be...   Be careful, Polnareff.   Now he wants me to pass!   Looks like he realizedhow shitty that piece of junk is.   Should've just stayed behind me, dumbass!   What?   A truck? No!   We're stuck! We're gonna crash!   Star Platinum!   That was close!   Without Star Platinum,we'd have been toast.   He's gone! Where'd that blasted car go?   Looks like he drove off.   What do you think?   Think that bastard in the caris an enemy Stand user?   Or some sick bastard with an axe to grind?   Of course he's one of Dio's lackeys!   We were almost road k*ll, for God's sake!   But he didn't att*ck withanything that resembled a Stand.   Regardless,we have to keep heading to the border.   If we see that car again,we'll take him out, whoever he is!   Damn straight.   What should we do about that truck?   Star Platinum left it a wreck.It won't be going anywhere.   We pretend we never saw it.Now let's get going.   He's so cool... and dreamy...    SYRIA   A roadside tea stand...   A break would do us some good.   If we stick around here a while,we should lose that crazy driver.   What is that stuff?   Sugarcane juice.   Care for a glass?   Might as well...   What?   It's him!   That car's here!   You! I've got a question!   The driver of that clunker over there...   Who is it?   Um, I'm not sure, sir.I didn't notice it there, sir...   Our driver won't just come outand announce it.   He's messing with us!   Then I guess that leaves uswith one option. Right, Jotaro?   Yeah...   Poor innocent bastards...   We'll just have to b*at them all down!   Hey, Jotaro, stop!   Mr. Joestar, not you too? This is crazy!   Pretty suspicious mug you got there...   What? Not me!   Slippery bastard just playedthe lot of us, didn't he?    Anyone see his face?    No. What is he trying to do?    He could be some madman with a car,or he could be trying to k*ll us.    I won't rest until I catch himand get to the bottom of this!    And I'm still pissedabout what that truck did to us!    Damn it! For a piece of junk,that car can really get up and go!    That's strange.    According to the map,    we should be running parallelwith train tracks here.    Who the hell cares?    We'll catch up soon anyway.    That bastard!    I'm gonna nail himonce we round this curve!    A dead end! That's impossible!    Where the hell did he go? He's gone!    It's like he just disappeared!    There's no way he crossedthe suspension bridge...    What?    It's him!    He keeps ramming us!    How'd he get behind us?    How much horsepower isthat piece of junk running with?    It's like a t*nk!    It's no use! Everyone, get out of the car!    Polnareff!    You can't get out untilthe rest of us are clear first!    Who'll hold down the brake?    Huh?    Sorry!    Hierophant Green!    Stop!    Hierophant can't supportthis kind of weight!    You'll be torn to shreds!    Mr. Joestar, with all due respect,I am aware of my own abilities.    I am not a fool.    You took the winch with you!    Not bad, Kakyoin.    So tell me, you like sumo?    Especially deadlocksat the edge of the ring...?    Exciting, isn't it?    Ow...    Yeah, I'm a fan of sumo.    But Jotaro, it's against the rulesto punch your opponent.     STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Nothing here suggestshe used a Stand att*ck.    I think it's safe to sayhe's just some weirdo.    Yeah. Either way,he's a goner after that fall.    Well... What goes around comes around.    Yeah, but I still wonder...    How'd it get behind us?    It's so strange.    It's not strange at all...    The radio!    He's coming through the AM/FM!    It was able to do thatbecause it's my Stand, Joestar!    What?    If he knows my name,    then he's got to be an enemy Stand user!    Where is he?    He's sending a signalfrom the car down there?    No way! You see that wreck?    No. That old jalopycould very well be a Stand.    Remember the boat Stand?This could be just like Strength.    Behold the Wheel of Fortune...    My Stand will lead you to your maker!    The Wheel of Fortune?    What the... An earthquake?    I've got a bad feeling...    Everyone, get in the car!    No, don't!    Don't go anywhere near it!    Couldn't be...    Below us!    Impossible! It burrowed upthrough the ground!    If that's not proof enoughthe car's a Stand, nothing is!    The Stand's user must be inside!    What the hell?    What is that thing?    It's like it's alive!    It's transforming for an att*ck!    Want to see who's stronger?    Don't, Jotaro. Don't fight it yet!    Not until we knowwhat that Stand's power is!    Jotaro!    Impossible... I couldn't see it.    The hell'd he sh**t at me?    Don't know what hit ya, eh?    You'll figure it out soon enough...    The moment you croak, that is!    Jotaro!    Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!    The hell is this?    They're not deep,but they sting like hell!    I couldn't see it.    He's sh**ting something at us,but our wounds...    I don't see anything in our wounds!    Are you all right, Jotaro?    Don't worry bout me. First things first...    I don't know what he's sh**ting,but he's got damn good aim.    I'll pulverize your legsso you can't move,    then run you over!    Quick! Between the rocks!    Stop skittering away, cowards!    -What?-What are you? Roaches?    Oh no! He's digging his way through!    We're no match for him in here!    He's like an insanemeathead who's lost control    cause he couldn't figure outsome kiddie puzzle!    Keep running!    They all left me behind!    So I'm a runaway!    So I'm a good-for-nothing kid!No one loves me! I'm always alone!    I'm gonna die!    Good grief.    If you have time to say all that crap,    you can run away, little brat.    I love you so much, Jotaro!    Go ahead and climb!    There's no path left for you to take!    No way to escape,no way to survive, no way to Egypt,    and last but not least, no future!    Because...    This Wheel of Fortune    is going to grind you into mincemeat    and splatter you all over these boulders!    Oh, no!    It's climbing up...    Is there anything this car can't do?    Good grief.    Guess we have no choice but to fight.    Everyone, get back.    Once he climbs up here,his undercarriage'll be exposed.    We'll see how strong it is then.    I get it.    Its undersidemight be vulnerable to att*ck!    You're pretty fast there, Jotaro!    But not too bright!    Your bodies reek,and you haven't even noticed!    Come to think of it,I think I did smell gasoline!    It's coming from us!    We're covered in gas!    It was sh**ting...    gasoline!    It was sh**ting small amounts of itat high speed, like b*ll*ts.    Incredible...    He wasn't trying to wound us.    He was dousing our bodies with gasoline!    Looks like you finally caught on,but it's too late!    Now all you need is a little jolt!    What?    Jotaro!    Jotaro!    Mr. Joestar, stay back!    We're soaked with gasoline, too.    Jotaro!    I win! Part Three ends here!    Oh?    Then who'll be taking the placeof the one and only Jotaro Kujo?    Don't tell me you think it'd be you.    You burrowed into the groundwith Star Platinum!    So the only thing that b*rned upwas your jacket?    A little parting wisdom:What you said earlier about paths...    was dead wrong.    You see, in life,you have to forge your own path.    Let Jotaro Kujo show you how it's done.    All you need is a little push!    I'm being crushed...    Jotaro!    And that's how it's done.    Your body paved a nice path.    You literally made a road with it.    Here ends the lesson.    What an odd fellow.    His arms are the size of boulders,    and yet everything else is so small.    Talk about a bluff.    Hey! Going somewhere?    Don't k*ll me!I'm just in this for the money!    Oh, God.    I can't believe the Stand wasdisguising such a small car.    Kind of reminds me of    a fluffy little sheepthat's just been shorn.    How pathetic.    I AM A MONK IN THE MIDSTOF SPIRITUAL TRAINING.     RESPECT MY ASCETIC PRACTICEBY NOT UNDOING MY RESTRAINTS    Well, then. Let's take this caracross the border.    Only fair since he smashed ours.    It's pretty b*at-up.I wonder if it'll last that long.    Help!    And you're on the next flightto Hong Kong.    Aw, why?    Shut up! You're in the way,don't you get it?    We might not make it that far...    Help!     WHEEL OF FORTUNEZII ZII    My seven assassins have all been defeated.    The shame!    I cannot bear to face Lord Dio.    Curses! That despicable Polnareff!Kakyoin!    Curse Jotaro and his wretched grandfather!    I, Enyaba, shall be your nextand final opponent!    I will fight with my own Stand,the Justice card!    The fog is getting worse from over there.    They d*ed with that look of fearon their face!    Why is that?    What is with everyone in this town?    This isn't an ordinary m*rder.    Joestar and company.    You seem to be travelers.    Assalam alaikum.
