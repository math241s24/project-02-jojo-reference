Li'l Bomber finished him off!Abba: All right.JoJo-main: ,I'll go find out who it was.Bruno: Hold on, Abbacchio.Bruno: We don't know how many of the boss's men are on this beach right now.JoJo-main: ,I need you to hurryBruno: and replay the footage of the one who took the photo of Trish's motherJoJo-main: ,on this beach fifteen years ago.Bruno: We need to get out of here as soon as we can, or we'll be in danger.Nara: But there's only one of them on the cliff!Abba: Bucciarati, I remember the Stand from the plane.Abba: Despite Mista turning that guy into a corpse, we still went through hell.Abba: I have to confirm who's up on that cliff, or I won't be able to relax.Bruno: Narancia, is the enemy up there dead?Nara: He's barely hanging on.Nara: But his breathing has just about ceased.Nara: He hasn't moved a millimeter.Bruno: All right.JoJo-main: ,Narancia and I will be the ones to go and check.Bruno: Abbacchio.Nara: Use your Moody Jazz to get the replay going right away.Abba: All right.Bruno: We can't stay here for too long.JoJo-main: ,How much time do you need?Abba: Well, we're talking fifteen years ago.Abba: It'll probably take eight to ten minutes.Bruno: Do it in five.Bruno: Giorno, Trish, and Mista are standing by in the turtle, so I'll bring them out here, too.Bruno: And the moment we learn the boss's true identity from Moody Jazz's replay,Bruno: we'll leave here.Bruno: Narancia, use Li'l Bomber to signal for Giorno and the others to get out here.Nara: You got it!Riso: I finally... figured it out...Riso: I know... your identity...Riso: Before I die...JoJo-main: ,show me... show me your face...Boss: I will not allow you to continue this conversation any longer, Risotto Nero.Boss: The last thing I wanted was for Bucciarati and his crew to find out we were here.Boss: You should die with pride as the leaderJoJo-main: ,of the Hitman Team, since you made it this far.Boss: I'm sure your men who are waiting in the afterlife will be proud of you.Boss: You're going to die at any second.Boss: And Bucciarati will come find you up here at any moment.Boss: Before that happens, give me back all the iron you stole from my body.Boss: If you do, I'll finish you off myself.Boss: Wouldn't it be the worst embarrassment of your life if you wereJoJo-main: ,to die slowly and miserably in front of BucciaratiJoJo-main: ,and his men, who took the lives of your team?Boss: Not to mention, they already consider you a pathetic enemy.Riso: I... die...Boss: What was that? I couldn't hear you.Boss: Hurry up and give me back the iron that was in my body, Risotto Nero.Riso: I'm saying... that I won't die alone.Riso: Within the chunks of flesh that Li'l Bomber blew off...Riso: The parts of me that scattered...Riso: This time, I'll be the one using it...Rios: Li'l Bomber, that is!Riso: Die!Nara: What the heck? Li'l Bomber is...Nara: That bastard stuck itself to my Li'l Bomber!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HE&\c&HF&}F{\c&HED&}o{\c&HCFFFB&}o{\c&HAE&}mBoss: Emperor Crimson.Boss: I blew away . seconds' worth of time.Boss: Everything that was in this world within that span disappeared,JoJo-main: ,and all that remains is what happened after those . seconds.Boss: Just the results of the b*ll*ts hitting you.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HDB&\c&HD&}Rata tat tat tat tat tatBoss: Well done, Risotto Nero.JoJo-main: ,You d*ed before you could lose your pride.Boss: But that also means I'm still facing this unfortunate predicament.Boss: This isn't good.JoJo-main: ,I have to do something...Bruno: Are you sure, Narancia?Nara: Yeah.Nara: Something made its way into Li'l Bomber!Boss: sh*t!Boss: They're coming...Boss: I have to hide... and somehow replenish my iron...Bruno: Stop right here.Bruno: We need to assess the situation carefully from here.Nara: Got it.Nara: It's all right, Bucciarati.JoJo-main: ,His breath's completely stopped, and his Stand has disappeared.Nara: He's definitely dead.Nara: Though, I sh*t him in the face, so it might be hard to tell who he actually was.Bruno: That man is probably the leader of the Hitman Team.Nara: How can you tell?Bruno: He's here alone without a team, which means that eitherJoJo-main: ,he was a very confident k*ller someone sent after us,Bruno: or he had no one left on his team.Bruno: And he was just k*lled by whoever this other very confident k*ller wasJoJo-main: ,for getting in the way.Nara: Uh, hello? Bucciarati?JoJo-main: ,It was my Li'l Bomber that turned him into a honeycomb—Bruno: You're wrong. You were just being used.Bruno: There was someone else here.Bruno: Look at his right foot.Bruno: Li'l Bomber's att*cks would have left burn marks.Bruno: But there are no burn marks on that foot.Bruno: It was only torn off.Nara: But... there was only one person on Li'l Bomber's radar!Nara: I'm still not getting any other signal!Nara: And why would anyone need to do that, anyway?!Bruno: Neither of them likely expectedBruno: the other to be as powerful as themselves, so the survivor is probably very badly wounded.Bruno: Though, I don't know how they're hiding their breathing.Bruno: Narancia, you sent out a signal for Giorno and the others to gather, didn't you?Nara: They should be heading to the place the picture came from right now.Bruno: All right, let's go after them.Bruno: From now on, don't overlook even the smallest hint of breathing,JoJo-main: ,even if it's a lizard or a mouse.Bruno: The other k*ller is still nearby.Bruno: He's an extremely dangerous k*ller sent by the organization.Boss: Damn it...JoJo-main: ,To think I'd have to endure this hellJoJo-main: ,back home on Sardinia,Boss: all because of those bastards...Nara: I know this is a rocky area, but there are way more than I expected.Nara: When I'm tracking the breathing of things like frogs and field mice,Nara: there are just too many!Nara: And if I make the range too sensitive,JoJo-main: ,I'll even pick up the breathing of the tourists and the exhaust from their cars.Nara: Damn it! Should I just light this whole place up?!Bruno: Calm down!Bruno: Frogs and field mice will try to hide in nearby holes.Bruno: Those aren't the movements you're looking for.Bruno: Look for the movement of someone trying to get away from us.Nara: Movement of someone trying to get away from us...Boss: I have to hurry...Boss: Abbacchio...Boss: I have to stop his Stand!Mista: That must be it.Mista: Hey, where are Narancia and Bucciarati?Mista: I only see Abbacchio on the beach.Gio: An enemy must've appeared.Gio: They're probably pursuing the enemy.Gio: And it seems that Abbacchio hasn't started his replay yet.Gio: Trish remembered that the photo was taken fifteen years ago in June,Gio: but she doesn't know the exact date.Gio: Moody Jazz is searching with a timer for the exact time.Gio: When it figures that out...Mista: It'll be able to change into the boss.Gio: Let's go.Kid: Hey, let's play over here.Kid: You're the goalie today.Kid : What? No way!Kid: Rock-paper-scissors, then!Bruno: Well? Can you tell them apart?Nara: I found it, Bucciarati! There's just one!Nara: It's  meters to our right.JoJo-main: ,That must be it. It's not very fast,Nara: but it's headed toward the tourists!Bruno: Narancia, don't att*ck just yet!Bruno: First, we have to determine exactly who we're dealing with.Nara: His movement stopped.Nara: Bucciarati?Nara: Blood?Bruno: You, there! I'm about to att*ck you!Bruno: If you are unable to fight anymore, come out from behind that rock.Bruno: I promise not to take your life.Bruno: I'll wait just three seconds. Got it?Bruno: It's been three seconds!JoJo-main: ,I take it you're prepared to fight!Bruno: Zipper Man!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HD&\c&HAB&}R{\c&HD&}i{\c&HDFAD&}pKid: Hey, come on!Kid : Where the heck are you kicking the ball? You suck!Kid: Oh, come on!Kid: It's your fault for not being able to get it!Kid: Just shut up and go get it already!Kid: You go get it!Abba: It's already the th. June's going to be over soon.Abba: How long is this gonna take?JoJo-main: ,It better actually be June fifteen years ago, damn it.Kid: Higher! Higher, damn it!Kid: Throw some rocks at it!Kid: Shake the branches! Climb up there!Abba: Hey! Pipe down, you little brats!Abba: Go play someplace where there's more room!Kid: Duh, we know that.Kid: Who the heck kicked it up there?Kid: Hey! Stop throwing rocks!Kid: Reach out your hand a little more!Kid: I know, damn it!Kid: I can't reach any further!Abba: Oh, hell. Go on, move out of the way!Nara: What the hell is this?!Bruno: Wait.JoJo-main: ,Don't att*ck, Narancia!Bruno: He's just a kid! He's one of the tourists!Nara: His mouth is sewn shut with the laces from his sneakers!Bruno: Only a Stand user could have done this.Bruno: They must've switched places with him.Bruno: And by the look of this kid, he seems to have lost a lot of blood.Bruno: But where did all that blood go?Nara: What the hell?! Where's the bastard that did this to him?!Nara: How the hell did he disappear?!Nara: He was super weak a second ago!Bruno: I don't know...JoJo-main: ,What in the world is going on?Kid: Thanks!Kid: All right!Kid: C'mon, let's hurry!Kid: Thanks, mister!Kid: Thanks!Kid: Hey, wait up!Dop: Thanks!Boss: Nothing beats coming back home.Boss: Luck's on my side.Kid: Let's go!Kid : Kick it right this time!Kid: You're the one who kicked it over there!Kid: I don't know what you're talking about.Sign: {\c&HFC&\fad(,)}Leone AbbacchioSign: {\c&HAC&\fad(,)}Moody JazzAbba: Uh... What are you doing under there, officer?Cop: Sorry to bother you while you're eating.Cop: I'm conducting an investigation.Cop: I'm looking for fingerprints.Cop: There was a robbery across the street last night.Cop: The victim was struck with a bottle.Cop: It shattered, and shards went everywhere.Cop: But all the shards weren't on the sidewalk.Cop: Particularly the part that was being held.Cop: We heard that the suspect threw something away here,JoJo-main: ,so I thought I might find something in this recycling bin.Cop: I should be able to get some fingerprints.Cop: That's the part I'm looking for.Abba: You're going to look through all that?Cop: Well, it's my job.Abba: I see.Abba: Yeah...Abba: Say, uh...Cop: Yes?Abba: For reference... I'm just curious.Abba: What are you going to do if you don't find the shards?Abba: You might not get any fingerprints.Abba: No... Even worse, if you do find them,Abba: and the suspect hires a crafty lawyer and is found not guilty...Abba: What makes you keep working so hard despite all those problems?Cop: Well...JoJo-main: ,I'm not just after the result.Cop: When all you want is the result, you start to look for shortcuts.Cop: And if you take that shortcut, you might lose sight of the truth.Cop: You'll become less motivated.Cop: I think the most important thing is the will to find the truth.Cop: As long as you have that,Cop: even if the suspect gets away this time, you'll get them eventually, right?Cop: Because that's what you're after.Cop: Don't you think so?Abba: I envy you.Abba: I used to think I wanted to become a police officer.Abba: Ever since I was a kid,Abba: I wanted to become a distinguished police officer.Abba: At some point, I even had that same will you have.Abba: But I messed up.Abba: You see, people like meAbba: are worthless.Abba: We never see things to the end.Abba: We always mess up somewhere along the way.Cop: That's not true, Abbacchio.Cop: You're doing great.Cop: We have the same will.Cop: That will you had when you first became a police officerCop: resides within your heart again now...Cop: Abbacchio.Abba: Why...JoJo-main: ,do you know my name?Abba: Come to think of it...JoJo-main: ,I think we've met before.Cop: Where are you going, Abbacchio?Abba: I'm getting on that bus!Abba: I'm starting to remember...Abba: That's right!JoJo-main: ,I have to go!Abba: I need to get back to my comrades!Cop: Did you forget, Abbacchio?Cop: You came here on that bus.Cop: This is the last stop.Cop: You can never return.Abba: Y-You're...Abba: That's right!

You can't be serious!Nara: Hurry up and heal him, Giorno!Nara: I said hurry up and heal him!Nara: Don't make me kick your face in, you bastard!Gio: It happened in a moment...Gio: It happened in a second at close range.Gio: We were too late...Gio: We were too late.Gio: How could someone like AbbacchioGio: let him get that close?Bruno: Mista...JoJo-main: ,Don't let Trish out of the turtle.Bruno: The enemy will probably att*ck again, to try to finish Trish off.Bruno: We have to leave here immediately.Bruno: This is my fault.Bruno: We can't gather any more clues about the boss here.Nara: Wh-What are you talking about, Bucciarati?Nara: Abbacchio is gonna wake up any second!Nara: It's just taking a bit longer than usual!Nara: He'll wake up if we just wait a little longer!Nara: Right, Giorno?!Nara: That's what happened before, right?Nara: H-Hey!Bruno: That's enough, Narancia!Bruno: It's too dangerous here!bruno: You need to use Li'l Bomber to survey the area.Nara: What are you talking about, Bucciarati?Nara: What the hell are you talking about?!Nara: If the enemy's gonna show up, I'll k*ll him right here, right now!Nara: If he's nearby, I'll face him head-on!Nara: Mista! Right, Giorno?Nara: Hey, Mista!Gio: We have to go, Narancia.Gio: Just as Bucciarati said!Nara: Wh-What?Nara: What did you just say?!Nara: Giorno!JoJo-main: ,You're probably just not trying hard enough!Nara: Bring him back!Nara: Give it all you have, you bastard!Mista: That's enough, Narancia!Nara: Shut the hell up!Mista: Narancia!Nara: Abbacchio...Nara: Are we just going to leave him here, Bucciarati?!Nara: Are we just going to leave Abbacchio all alone?!Nara: I don't want to leave him behind!Bruno: This is an order, Narancia!Bruno: Abbacchio knew that this was a possibility when he came here!Bruno: We're leaving.Nara: Bucciarati, wait!Gio: That's...Gio: Bucciarati, wait.
