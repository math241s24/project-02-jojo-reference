Polnareff, keep your guard up.   Forget who you're talking to?   Mr. Joestar and Avdolseem to have gone.   And it doesn't seem likethere was a struggle.   Old man. Avdol. Anyone home?   Jotaro.

You don't get it, do you?   You didn't realizeI lured you here.   You thought you were hunting me?   You're going to fry!   Magician's Red!   Hermit Purple!   Avdol can defend himselfwith his flames.   It's over for you, Joestar.   My Stand, the Goddess Bast,   is far stronger thanyour Hermit Purple!   Um... Uh...I dropped my change...   Where'd it go...   Hey... What do youthink you're doing?   I can tell you're following us.   I can see the evil in your eyes.   Huh?   Were you talking to me?   I'm not sure whatyou're talking about.   Evil? My loving parentsgave me these baby blues...   I found my change.   Oh? Then prove it!   Prove that you're not a Stand user...   Bastard!   That was close...   So you are a Stand user!   He's running?   Hey, Jotaro! It's the enemy!   I found him!    Polnareff...    Where'd you go?    Jotaro, over here!    Come back here, you!    Wait!    What the hell? He's fast!How can he be so fast?    He's already so far ahead...    Huh? My voice... Whoa!    Ow!    What's with my shoes...They're huge!    Hey, watch it.    Run around in the streetand you'll get hurt.    You're lucky I wasn't some car.    Shut up, idiot!    Lecture someone elsewith that big mouth!    Now outta my way!I'm chasing someone!    What do you thinkyou're doing? Hey!    What? It's really high up here!    He's lifting me up with one arm?    How tall is this guy?    His face and hands are huge!    Hey, you little brat!    I'll teach you not to talkto adults that way.    You think you can be a grown-upjust by wearing grown-up clothes?    Annoying, good-for-nothing brat...    You bastard...    What? What the hell?    Move it, kid! Get outta the way!    What's going on?    Everyone looks like giants!    What?    What the?    I'm a kid?    Is this really me?    I've turned into a kid!    SETALESSI    Could this really be...    Is this kid really...    Me? I'm a kid!    I turned into a kid!    Impossible! No way!    It must be his Stand!    That creep must haveput a curse on me    when his shadow Stand touched me.    This can't be happening!    sh*t, this is bad.This is really bad!    Jo...    Jo... No, Jay, Jackie, J...    What was his name?I can't remember!    But I know this guy...He can help me!    Why can't I remember?    Hey, kid. Have you seena French guy around here?    He's about yea tall, and he's gotthe same haircut as you.    That's me! It's me!    Good grief... That was a mistake.    Wait!    You're a kid now, my boy.    Both in mind and body,you could say.    Soon, you'll lose all the memoriesyou built up during adulthood.    I'm going to forget everythingI knew as an adult?    It's true...It's all becoming a blur...    Guess it's about time, huh?    I love picking on the weak!    Attaboy, Alessi!    Hold it right there!I won't let you get away, brat.    I can't really say this too loud,    but picking on the weak reallydoes it for me. Maybe too much...    I may be a littlesick up here, but...    You know what they say...    If you think you're crazy,then you're probably not.    That must mean I'm all right.    And it feels oh so good to knowI'll never lose to some kid.    Mister! Whatever your name is hel--    So you see...    my mission is to dispose of you.    Unfortunately...    I don't have time to savor the fun.    That's Silver Chariot, huh?    I suppose I should'veexpected as much;    seems you were able to summonyour Stand when you were a kid.    But...    Chariot... Even Chariot is a kid!    Pami!    And he's weak!His sword's bent from those b*ll*ts!    My Stand, Set,reverted you to childhood.    Your mental abilities reverted too.    Meaning, your Standis also a child's Stand,    back before you two werefully attuned to each other.    Now do you get it?    Seems you do. Attaboy!    Still, as weak as it is, your Standis still at your disposal.    I shall use my Standfor your execution.    Die, Polnareff!    You're mine!    Oh, no!    It snapped!    Huh?    Take that! I meant to do that!    Ow! It hurts!    Are you all right, little boy?    He's gone!    That guy runs as soon asthere's another adult around.    I'm safe for now, but what a freak!    Wait, little boy.    You're hurt! What happened?    Huh? Uh... Um, uh...    What are you mumbling?    Huh?    Those wounds need treatment.I'll fix you up at my house.    Come on.    Should I go?    I have to defeat him or else    I won't be able to transform backinto an adult!    But he won't att*ck mewith her around.    I can think of a planin the meantime!    Come on, now.    Whoa...    Oh, right.    You're hurt. Here, grab on.    She smells good...    It hurts!    Damn it!    I'm not just going to sit back andtake this from that snot-nosed kid!    He's gonna pay...I swear I'll butcher that kid!    Doesn't look likehe's coming after me.    All right, little boy.    We're going to take a bath.Let's take those clothes off.    -Huh?-You're covered in grime.    I'll clean those wounds right upand put some medicine on you.    What are you staring at?    Oh, all right.    I'll take them off for you.Here, raise your leg.    This isn't...    What's wrong?    Nothing.    No, it is something!    It is definitely something!    I don't know why,    but I feel likeI should be really embarrassed...    And...    It's so tiny!    I don't know why,but I'm really sad. Boo-hoo!    Here, hold on.    We need to get all that dirt off.    -Here, lift your leg.-Huh?    I'm so happy!    Is it really okay if I do this?    Is it okay? Of course it is.    If we don't clean those woundsthey'll get infected.    Oh, you've got dirton your wee-wee too.    I just don't know why I'm so happy!    I guess it's all part ofbeing a "kid"!    All right, be a good boy, okay?    Okay!    Look at him... he's delirious...    I'll chop his delightedlittle face in two!    What are you grinning about?    All right. Time to wash your hair.    Huh? No!    I hate shampoo!    -It gets into my eyes! I hate it!-Rock, paper...    Scissors.    Monkey...    -Monkey do...-Monkey do...    I lost!    Now, sit down.    Does it sting?    It stings a lot.    Then can you washyour hair all by yourself?    Uh-huh, I can.    Oh! Attaboy.    Yes, that's it.    Attaboy!    That's impossible!    You fell out of the window,covered in blood...    The iron bars feel too close!    This is what it meansto be utterly helpless!    I touched the shadow again!    -Lick, lick...-The lady's gone... The lady...    What do you think happened to her?
