02x29 - Anubis, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:44Under the chin, right, Polnareff?  What?  It's me, you fool.The Anubis Stand!  Now what?  Die!  I'll shave your jaw clean off!  Who the hell are you?  And what've you donewith the barber?  Could that sword possibly be…   Could it be the Stand?   Is it controlling the barber?   So the guy at Kom Ombowasn't the Stand user!   Polnareff…   Either way,I'm still stronger than you!   He's so strong…   I learned Chariot's movesand powers during our last battle!   I won't lose twiceto the same opponent!   Come on.    Come on, you've almost got it.    EPISODE   : ANUBIS, PART     Oh?   Polnareff and Jotaroseem to be taking a while.   Polnareff, what's…   Is this barber a…   Stay back, Jotaro!   This sword is the Stand.   It's too dangerous to useStar Platinum's bare fists   against this blade.   The barber isn't the Stand user!He's just a puppet.   Not to mention,   this Stand's even stronger now!   You bastard!   Whoa, there.   Too much to handle?   Now I know the limitsof your defense.   Let's see if you can survivemy next att*ck, Polnareff!   Polnareff!   He's getting stronger…with every strike!   I can't keep parrying.   He's going to get me!   Now!   Take this!   What?   I know all your moves now.   It doesn't matterwho my wielder is.   If I fought you once…   I never…   ever lose twice!   It's no use.Without my rapier I'm dead…   sh*t! Help, Jotaro!   Star Platinum!   Think he's through?   No, that was a shallow punch.   And it took just abouteverything I had.   -Hey, Khan. Are you all right? Hey…-sh*t. This guy's strong.   We haven't seenone like this in a while.   A stand that doesn'trely on gimmicks…   Just pure power.   Not bad, Star Platinum.   So the rumors are true.You're swift.   But now that I've seen it,I can b*at it.   What's wrong, Khan?   Stay back!   He's being controlled!   If you want to remain in one piece,get back in and hide!   We're in major trouble, Jotaro.   The more we fight,the faster it gets.   Its next att*ck will beits fastest,   and strongest yet!   Move, Polnareff.   It's me he's after!   Run, Jotaro!   Die!   He caught it withhis bare hands?   To take that risk is…   Now I know.   The true source ofStar Platinum's strength   isn't its speed and precision.   It's Jotaro's split-seconddecision-making ability   and nerves of steel.   Now I know…   Is he dead?   No, he's just unconscious.   Jotaro, don't touch that sword!   You snapped it in half,   but the Stand's powersmight still be lingering.   Unsheathed, the sword controlsanyone who touches it.   Let's get the blade back inwithout touching the hilt.   Now what?   If someone ever draws it out again,we're done for.   This thing's alreadylearned our abilities.   We won't get any second chances.   How about tossingthe freaking thing into the river   to live at the bottom of the Nile?   The bottom of the Nile, huh?Sound's good to me!   Hold it! Police!   Perfect timing.This guy needs a hospital…   I have reports of a brawlat the barber shop!   What are you doingwith that sword?    Hand it over!    Hey, stop!    Don't pull it out!    Polnareff!    No!    His eyes… that stare…    He's under the sword's spell.    Hey! You drew the sword!    I drew the sword?    Officer, you should reallybe more careful.    And you call yourselfa servant of the law?    Hey, what are you doing?    You're the one who drew it!    I don't know who you areor where you're hiding,    but it's clear Polnareff'sunder your control.    I've never foughtagainst Polnareff.    And with Chariot I won't be ableto pull any punches.    I could end up k*lling him.    Don't forget that I, Anubis,    have already witnessedall of Star Platinum's moves.    If I've fought you once,    I never lose twice!    Hey, now.    His speed… it's incredible!    He's getting faster.Soon he'll outpace me!    I have to stop his sword!    I've got to catch the blade again!    It sped up!    I'll take your head!    Wha...    Such speed and power.    It's the fastest StandI've ever faced.    At this rate I'll lose.    I have to fight Polnarefffull force, or I'm dead.    So you head butted the sword away    after you realizedyou'd failed to catch my blade…    I almost had you.    I was so close.    But…    I've learned that skill now, too.    Jotaro.    You think you can k*ll Polnareffand live, don't you?    Such wishful thinking. How naive!    Because… what I'm about to show youwill end all of this!    Can you…    b*at this, Jotaro?    Behold the Silver Chariotand Anubis…    two-sword technique!    ANUBISKHAN    Dammit…    This extra sword,his accelerating speed…    Even my Star Platinum…    What's the matter?A bit winded, Jotaro?    I'll stop him before he kills me!    Star Finger!    My right arm is as lightas a feather now.    Interesting.I guess that was one option…    You look surprised.    Round two! Armor release!    You fool!Your "ora ora" is no match    for two swords wieldedby two master swordsmen!    Your stomach is wide open!    I've got you now!    I did it! I win!    Master Dio!I've exterminated Jotaro!    I, the god Anubis, have k*lled him!    Victory!    Don't think you'll be able to stopthe blade or pull it out.    I've already surpassedStar Platinum.    Now for the final thrust…    The final thrust?    Precisely!    I'll slice open your bowels!And Master Dio will rejoice!    Stop.    Don't drive the blade inany further…    It'll be m*rder.    No mercy!    I'll spill your gutsonto the pavement!    What?    You're breaking me!I have to pull free!    Stop!    Weren't you saying somethingabout slicing me open?    I told you it'd be m*rderif you drove that blade in any further…    your m*rder, that is.    You're an easy targetwhen the sword is still.    What a pain…    This last att*cktook everything I had.    Luckily it was enough to defeat him    before he could learn itlike all the rest.    I've never been so exhausted.    I have to find Avdoland the old man, fast.    What just happened?    The sword didn't possess me,did it?    Yeah… But it's over.    Forgive me…    Polnareff, get the old manand Avdol.    I can't walk. I'm too tired.    Wow, it's shiny…    Now I've learned that trick, too…    My Stand user was the swordsmithwho forged me     years ago.    He perished long ago,but I survive.    I am a Stand with no master.    Master Dio found me and saved mefrom the shadows of the museum.    Master Dio's Stand, The World,is far more powerful than me.    That's why I pledged my loyalty.    Jotaro,    I swear, I'll m*rder you!    I know your strength.    Your speed…    You'll never see it coming!    I'll s*ab you in the back!    Die, Jotaro!    What?    No! I missed!A dog tripped me?    Where did that mutt come from?    Hey, Iggy.    What are you eating?A lollipop?    Eating right off the ground again…Filthy mutt.    That river is…    The Nile River!    No, this can't be happening!    I'm heading right for it!    If I fall into the river,I'm done for! I'll rust away!    Somebody stop me!    Ah ha! A wall!The wall will stop me!    Lucky me!    What?    No! I was so panicked,    I went right throughthe wall by accident!    I'm going to fall in!    Yes! It's a ship!I'm saved!    If I wedge into those planks,    that guy's curiositywill make him pull me out.    Then, I'll take over his mind!    I'll use his bodyto take revenge on Jotaro!    Ack! A cow's on board?    Wait! Calm down! Hey!    Cool it, you stupid cow!    I know!I'll take over the cow's mind!    And then…    I won't make it in time!    Hey, look.That cow is going berserk!    Good grief.Who cares about a damn cow?    Just go get the old man and Avdol.    Help me!    Hey, fishies. Come here.    Come on, swim to me.    Hey, wait! Where are you going?    Hey, Mr. Crab.    Do me a favor and take me ashore.    I'll give you something yummy.    Wait! Don't leave me, Mr. Crab!    I'll be rusted throughin a couple of days!    Help me!    Don't leave me!    I'm so alone!     ANUBIS DEFEATED    Stupid mutt.    What are you staring at?    There's nothing to eat over there.    Wha...    You stinking…    What the hellhave you been eating?    Polnareff…    To think,all that happened without us.    The Anubis Stand, huh…That must have been rough, Jotaro.    Yeah…    -Stop!-I'm never going anywhere...    -Get off of me!-...with him again.    Stop it already, you stupid mutt!    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    The average tourist to Egypt    is mostly unaware of the country'srich ethnic diversity.    Take this Egyptian man,    wearing the traditional jellabiya.    Or this Egyptian nationalof Nubian descent.    Here is a Bedouin residentfrom Egypt's desert region.    This gentleman    hails originally from a differentcontinent altogether, India.    And for a particularlynon-anthropological example,    another member ofthe Egyptian community…    Hey! That chick's legs are smokin'!So hot!    I can't keep my eyes off of her.    She's just… wow!They pull you right in!     PREVIEW    Is something wrong, Mr. Joestar?    There is something wrong!    What do you think you're doing,    -you old pervert?-Something is wrong.
