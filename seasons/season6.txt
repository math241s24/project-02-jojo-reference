05x01 - Stone OceanQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:11: P.M. It's raining. OCTOBER ,  It was… always raining. What the… Hey, what are you making the fuss for over there? You're getting on my nerves! I'm done for. I can't live any longer. He saw me last night. A male prison guard. I can't live anymore! Just k*ll me! Dammit! Man, what the hell? What's up with you? What's your name again? Jo… What was it? Jolyne, was it? What do you mean he saw you? Well, you know, like… The "M" word… What? In other words, I… Speak up! I'm trying to say… Well, like… Masturbation… -What? -What? What? -Hold on. -I won't be able to get married anymore! So wait, you were seen? A prison guard saw you touching yourself? Which guard was it? I woke up before sunrise. Something about the moonlight going in through the shape of the window bars kind of, well, turned me on. So, I… Yes. When I came to my senses and looked up from the bed, the youngest guard here was staring at me with a face like he couldn't believe what he just saw. He stood right in front of this cell! Just k*ll me! I've seen him around. He's the one that's kind of handsome, isn't he? Oh, my god. So how much did he see? I'll get to the point. How low were your panties? Man, you're really after me. Like hell I'd tell you. But I learned my lesson. I'll never masturbate again ever as long as I'm alive! I swear it! I don't know about that. What? Man, how can you get turned on with those bars? Shut it, snotface. Stop butting in, you airhead! As if you've never done it before. I'm not dirty-minded like you lowlifes. And who the hell are you? You want to bet on who can last longer? Idiot, how is this a bet? Masturbation is done in secret. How can we prove that we haven't done it? What if I told you that the joint on your left ring finger tells all? You're in here for sexual as*ault, aren't you? Your ring finger's discolored. Inmate , , and . You're getting transferred. Standby at the bars. Reach your arms out of the cell. What you said about the ring finger, was it true? Or like fortune-telling? You're Japanese, aren't you? You're an interesting one. So what did you do? Why did you get thrown in? I'm innocent. EPISODE : STONE OCEAN You were charged. For stealing and hit-and-run. VISITATION ROOM You were arrested for robbery twice in the past. You won't be granted parole. In other words, Jojo, you will be transferred to Green Dolphin's holding cell where you'll be tried at the court. Don't call me Jojo. Only my mom calls me that. And what's this criminal history? Sure, I borrowed a bike without asking. I was  at the time! Like I said, I'm innocent! You better defend me at any cost. I'm coughing up money. Yes, I will do my best for you and the law. Dammit. Also, when do I get to see my mom? You know she's tender-hearted. She's a little worn out. Most of all, she's worried sick about you. She brought you a few things. You won't have to wear a uniform while awaiting your sentence. Here's your change, a book, and a magazine. Not to mention your homework. What is this? It seems to be a charm of some sort. There's a tiny stone inside. Your father had given it to your mother to pass it on to you when you're in trouble. What did you say? That hurts! It hurts! Are you okay, Jolyne? What's that screaming for? Be quiet! It's nothing! It was just a pinch. Is this a stone? Where did you hear about my dad? Your mother is attempting to contact him. His daughter faces a great predicament, after all. As you know, your father is a marine biologist. He is conducting research in Africa and he hasn't been able to fly out here yet. She's trying to fly him here? No way in hell he'll come. He's… That bastard… I don't need this cursed charm of his! What the… What's the matter? It's nothing. When is your next visit? In two days, at the visitation room of Green Dolphin Prison's holding cell. Hey, Jolyne, I thought you were innocent. Though it's a probationary cell, it's still under Green Dolphin Prison. If you're transferred there-- The trial will clear my name. I won't go to prison. We are crossing the bridge now. We'll arrive in ten minutes. That didn't take long. Ten minutes until we're there. -What? Who said that-- -I heard it from the driver's seat. You can't hear them from here. We're crossing the bridge now. ETA is ten minutes. Understood. How did you know? Is this another fortune-telling of yours? Yes, it's strange, isn't it? I'm not sure either. You sure are a funny one. I'm Ermes Costello. I robbed a gas station. It's my second time, so I'll be sentenced without a doubt. Nice to meet you, Ermes. NOVEMBER , : P.M. Green Dolphin Street State Prison and the adjunct probationary cell, aka "The Aquarium." The premises cover  square kilometers. Imprisoned here are  males,  females, and  minors under  years of age. Hey Jolyne. You got cash on you? Maybe. Hey, I'm warning you. If you don't bring in a few Benjamins, you might end up dead. If you don't have any on you now, make sure to have someone bring them to you at a visitation. And you're assuming I'll be thrown in because? I'm just giving you a heads up. As if you've got cash yourself. The guards would've taken them right out of your hand. How naive, Jolyne. There are many ways to stash them. You mean, you stuck them up your ass or the other hole? Gross! I thought that was a movie thing! Dumbass, that's the first place they inspect. Then where? Ah, you got them in your boobs, don't you? You slid some cash in on top of some silicone implants? No way! I was kidding! You found me out. Don't tell a soul, though. See the stitches? It bleeds a little when I take them out, but I got five s in one and a  under the other. We're at Green Dolphin Street Prison's probationary cell. Inmate  and , get off. Inmate , Ermes Costello, this isn't your stop. Welcome back, Ermes Costello. What brought you back? Robbery? An injury incident? What? Did you say something to me just now? Inmate , look straight ahead! Spill it, Ermes. I know you've got some. You got cash, right? Cash? I got none, I'm afraid. I hear them! Something's not right! These guards can't hear them at all! It's just like when we were crossing the bridge. I can hear faraway voices! Ouch! This is… Spit them out, Ermes. This is your second time in the Aquarium. I know you're carrying some! What is this? Do not talk, Inmate ! Can't they see these threads springing out of my hand? Okay, I'll take them out now. You know, Ermes. This isn't enough to prove our friendship. I bet you got more on your body somewhere. Oops, the bus is braking! Please let me off the hook with the . I've got no one who can give me more. Please, I'll die in there without the money! You got big tits for someone with a big build. Those tits are suspicious. Let's search them. Hold her still. Sure. No… Stop! Let go! Who do you think I am, bitch? What… What just sprung out? What is this… Could it be… Did that stone cause this? What did my dad send me? NOVEMBER ,  A.M. Hey, remember how I tossed that charm… PROBATIONARY JAIL …at the visitation room? I wonder where it ended up. Well, I do not recall. Anyhow, let's discuss our case. If you wish to claim your innocence, I need to know this detail. During that hit-and-run, were you the one in the driver's seat? OCTOBER , : P.M. WEST PALM BEACH, WEST FLORIDA So about your nickname. Romeo, can I call you "Rocchu" from now on? Sure thing. Only when you're gargling mouthwash. What, you don't like it? Why not? Rocchu, I'm hungies! How about that? Doesn't that fly? No way. My friends can't hear that. I love the way it's all lovey-dovey. My mom has called me "Jojo" ever since I was a baby. I want you to call me Jojo too, Rocchu. Hell no. Anyway, I'm thirsty. Let me take a sip. You can't. It's a cocktail with a strong alcohol content, %! I'll be safe. No, you can't. I said no. Romeo! Romeo… Just now, we… Romeo! This isn't happening… No! This is bad! We need to get help. Romeo, call an ambulance! Jolyne, please. Please don't do that. Don't call. Listen to yourself! We need to get help! He d*ed instantly! You're going to run? No! This was an accident! And we can't run! This car is the evidence! Let's say the car was stolen! But… Jolyne! Jolyne, if I'm arrested, our future together is over! Not to mention, I'll go to jail. We'll be separated! So please! Don't you love me? Of course, I do. But this is… A car is coming. We're finished if we're seen! Jolyne! I need a hand! He's dead, like I thought! Please. Help me, Jolyne! I love you! Jolyne! Jolyne, the police believe that you stole the car and caused the accident while under the influence. And what is Romeo's claim? He claims his car was stolen. Goddammit… I want to die! Was Romeo the one driving? I can't tell you that. All right, then. This is what we'll do. Jolyne, do you know what a "plea deal" is? If you admit all of your crimes, they'll reduce your DUI charge. Then you'll only get sentenced for stealing and involuntary manslaughter. You'll be paroled after a year or so. I told you to fight for innocence! I understand, but we need to compromise. If they find you guilty during the trial, you'll get at least five years. We don't have time, Jolyne. We must agree to the deal before the trial starts! Defendant Cujoh. You voluntarily admit to the details of the plea, is that correct? Yes, I admit. This court will consider that the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh, admits to the crime and consider her release since the m*rder was not premeditated. However, this court cannot condone the act of disposing of the victim, who was still alive, in a swamp, effectively murdering him. The victim was alive? What is that about? What is he saying? A m*rder? This court finds and determines that the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh, shall be confined to Green Dolphin Street State Prison for  years. This court is adjourned. What? Hold on… Fifteen years? How could you? I struck a deal! I agreed! Didn't I, Mr. Lawyer? I've done my best. Take care, Jolyne Cujoh. Hold it. Where are you going? What are you saying? Fifteen years? What's this about? That's not what we agreed on! Hold still! I said hold it! You bastard! You don't need to worry anymore. The sentence has been finalized. She agreed to the plea deal. She won't be able to appeal. There won't be any further investigations. Congratulations, Romeo. Thank you. You saved my life. Please thank your rich father. Romeo, you… Romeo! Fifteen years… My entire youth,  years! From now on, in addition to the name your parents gave you when they birthed you little shits, the state will give you an inmate number, so be grateful! This prison is Category Level , Maximum Security! FE. When you hear this number, whether you're taking a sh*t or eating, it's referring to you! b*at that into your head! FE, we will now conduct a body search. Throw everything you're wearing into this tray and… Strip! Begin! Remember, education is the first thing you need to do to trash. Make sure to humiliate them. What's taking your time? "Strip" means your panties too! Now, show me your ass… Are all fours okay? Or do you want me to lie on my back? I can perform a stunt or two if you'd like. You bastard… You think you can stroll out of here? It sure is hot in here. My shirt is covered in sweat. It might rain. Would you like to take a break in the director's office? The AC is on. Oh, don't inconvenience yourself. All the documents have been submitted. This heat is nothing compared to my client's fate. For her to receive a -year sentence at her age… If only I were able to help. No, you are a spectacular lawyer. Oh, speaking of your client, Jolyne Cujoh, she asked me to give this letter to you. The content's been cleared. I see. Pass this on to him too. Feeling comfy? But you will keep sweating. Now and forever. What the hell? I can't reach him right now and I'm powerless. I can't wait  years. I'll come to see you. And Romeo, farewell, my first love. Between that dingy place and my car, the air sure is different. To think that I have to breathe the same air as those scum with this job. I can't breathe… This thread… is choking my neck! The AC might be drying it out! I must… remove it! This is another way to use it. It activates with my thoughts and I can manipulate it with the force of my mind. He wanted me to protect myself using that charm. This will be fun.
05x02 - Stone Free / Prisoner FE40536: Jolyne CujohQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:12Welcome, inmates. I am the warden of Green Dolphin Street State Prison, Locobaroco. And this lovely crocodile here is Charlotte, my assistant. Great to meet you! Charlotte, please explain how life is in this institution. Okay! Similar to the United States, this prison is based on the concept of freedom and equality. You may freely walk around the facility and exercise as you please. You may use the phones, the shower, and the library as well. If you are an exemplary inmate, you may even own a TV. You could also work or study and earn university credits. That's right. Yes! What is it, Charlotte? But Warden, there are rules too, right? You're absolutely correct, Charlotte! First, do not remove the wristband with your inmate number. No lending or borrowing of items between inmates. No possession of metal objects. How about earrings? The warden's still speaking! Shut up! Earrings are prohibited, FE, Jolyne Cujoh. Feel free to ask any questions to the prison guards. You are now dismissed. All right! Everyone, face left! It's so spacious. The entire island is the prison. Oh, a crocodile. FE. Cell  will be your home from now on. Today's free time is over. The cells open at : a.m. Breakfast begins at seven, but you may choose to sleep in. Try to get along now. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I'm Jolyne. I'm Gwess. Want some? Thanks. But I don't have an appetite. There's so much to get used to-- Ouch! What the hell-- The bottom bunk is mine! You got a problem with that, you bitch? I didn't mean to instigate a fight. I just misunderstood since your things were on the top bunk. That charm! Bitch! Get your dirty hands off of my stuff! Can I see that charm? There should be a small stone and a photograph of my parents inside! It could have belonged to me! I bought it for two dollars from a newcomer the other day. Because it's just so beautiful. Let me see it! You better watch your mouth, ugly! Okay, I'll buy it off of you. How much do you want? Two hundred dollars. What? You heard me, dumbass. I said  dollars. You bitch… Lights out! What's going on? Too much is happening all at once. I have so much to think about. I'm so sad that I'm starting to cry. What the hell? I'm sorry. About last night, I mean. What? It's morning. Here. You can look at it. But… There was nothing inside it. No pictures, no nothing. See? Was there anything else in it? Like a stone? No. Nothing. Anyway, please forgive my behavior last night. I'm shy around new people. Oh, there's nothing to forgive. It was my fault. I don't know the rules around here yet. Jolyne, you are a good person. Let's be friends from now on. Yes, I'd like that. Anyway, it's breakfast time. I'll see you there. Hold on, I'll go with you. What the hell? There's water all over the place! My pants are soaking wet. This sucks! What do you mean it's "sold out"? I haven't eaten yet. As you can see, you're free to sleep in. You're also free to get here late. Isn't there food for everyone? Any leftover milk or bananas? That's the strange thing about prisons. That makes no sense! Oh, Jolyne, you took your sweet time. I'm so full. Hey, Gwess. You had two milk cartons and two bananas! Two bananas? No way. Are you still asleep? Also, sorry about the water. I accidentally spilled it. I'll clean it up later. I already cleaned it off. Oh, thank you. You're so kind, Jolyne. This is… Jump for me. I believe in you. I love you, and you love me. Don't we trust one another? Do it for me. Good boy! Aren't you an adorable little birdie? Good job! Here's your reward! Good morning! No, Pi-chan. Not "good morning." Say "I love you." You're such a darling when you say that you love me. I love you! Good boy! You're such a good boy, Pi-chan! Next, perch. Jump over. Taking risks is part of trust-building, Pi-chan. What? Come on, jump! Whoa… What did you just say? "Whoa"? Say that again! Do birds go "whoa"? I love you! I love you! I love you! You're covering it up now, aren't you? You think such a blatant lie works on me? Do you? I've had it with you. We're through. What was that? A banana? What is this? Though it's tiny, it's definitely real. That woman… had already k*lled it! What is she doing? I knew it, she must have used that charm to gain some sort of ability! Where did she get that tiny human? What… happened to me? STAND NAME: G.G. DOLLS STAND MASTER: GWESS This is… My body shrank! I knew it was you. How did you snatch away my Pi-chan? Jolyne! Jolyne. I'm starting to like you, really. What happened to my body? Explain! Listen, Jolyne. Please don't talk. The person inside that parrot-- Hey, I said no talking! Get in it. I removed its guts. There was a flaw to using a parrot. Birds can't use their arms and they can't grab. Rats, though, have front paws. He was a prison guard who got fired for slacking off. The warden thinks he left the facility. Also, I told you to keep quiet. But if you can mimic a rat squeak, I'll let it pass. You can say, "I'm going, squeak!" or "I'm hungry, squeak!" Got it? Just as I thought, you look darling! Now it's time for training. Go, faster. Run! No slowing down. Lift, Chorokichi. Chorokichi? Everything has a name. The Word was with God, and all things were created by the Word. That's why I named this power that shrank your size. "G.G. Dolls." This is the name of my mental power. Let's stack another book. You… You think you can cheat me like that? How dare you betray my trust. We're through! Just kidding! You passed, Chorokichi. Your shrewdness will prove useful. Very very good! Can you see? Down this corridor is the control room. The switch within that room can deactivate the locks in this facility. You can pass through. You see what I'm getting at. You are I are breaking out. For some reason, I can't shrink myself. But if we cooperate, we can leave. We need to trust each other. Of course, we'll need to concoct a more reliable plan. First, I want you to check out everything beyond this corridor. Do you really think we can escape? I told you to squeak like a rat! Squeak, how do I get to the control room, squeak? How cute! How precious. But how should I know, dumbass? That's why you're on this mission. Look up. That's the surveillance camera. But it can't see below this bar. Walk under the handrail. Put your hood on. Now go! Hey, you. What are you doing? That's right, you with the headband. State your name and number! FE. My name is Gwess. I'm just loitering around. If you have no business here, then leave! Leave immediately. Sure thing, Mr. Prison Guard. There are four steel doors. Which one is the control room? Also, there are two cameras here. What's going on? I'm running out of space. What's happening? Did you hear that? Yes, I heard it too. It was close by. My body… It's getting larger! The coffee's ready. Maybe it was from the coffee maker. -It didn't sound like it. -This is bad. What's going on? Distance? Is it because Gwess is far from me? Is this ability affected by distance? I heard it again! Something's lurking nearby! sh*t! It's right under there! Hey, move out of the way! I said move it! That's hot! What the hell, man? What the… I told you it was from the coffee maker! My bad. This investigation is over! I need to get back before I get too big! What is that? G.G. Dolls! This monster… This monster… It resembles a doll, but it's transparent. It's just like my thread. Others can't see it. It's the materialization of Gwess's ability. "G.G. Dolls." This is the name of my mental power. It shrank me and tore the prison guard to shreds! This shithead was inside the rat with me! And Gwess. She didn't know that the ability would get deactivated. My body is returning to its original size. This monster thinks I'm ditching, so he's here for a hunt! Not only that, he wants to completely k*ll me! -G.G. Dolls! -sh*t! Why is this happening to me? Am I going to get k*lled by a monster like him? I'm stuck! Threads. A bundle of threads. This must be the shape of my energy. Its form! The yarn weaves into its form. Hey, monster! Scream, you shithead! Get Gwess. Hurry! Jolyne… Turns out you have an ability. Gwess! Stop! Don't hurt my precious G.G. Dolls! Shut up! Make my body smaller so I can escape! Just by a bit, though, got it? All right, you can sleep on the bottom bunk bed! Please don't hate me despite what happened between us! But please squeak every once in a while. Just hurry it up! Finally. Now, the charm. Give me the stone and tell me who sold it to you. Of course. Two hundred dollars, was it-- Shut up, bitch! Tell me who sold it to you! All right. Some woman named Ermes sold it to me. Ermes? I don't know much about her. Here. Well… I got her! Guards! We have a problem! This bitch here crossed the g*n point! Come here, quick! What are you doing there? How did you get over there? Jailbreak! Code ! It's all over for you now. The prison guard is retrieving the shotgun as we speak. He has every right to sh**t you down! No questions asked! Jolyne! Serves you right! It's what you get for trampling on my heart! Good grief, Gwess. You said everything has a name. I'll name this ability of mine too. "Stone Ocean." I'll become free from this ocean of stones. Did you hear me? Stone Ocean. That's the name. If there's a hierarchy system in this prison, I'll follow it. However, I'm the one who gives orders. Now let me cross over. -What? -Where is she? -She disappeared. -What? Are you sure she was there? Well, I just saw her back, so… Strange… Dad…
05x03 - The Visitor (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:13This court finds the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh… You're an interesting one. So what did you do? Why did you get thrown in? I'm innocent. …shall be confined to Green Dolphin Street State Prison for  years. What is this? Turns out you have an ability. "Stone Ocean." I'll become free from this ocean of stones. EPISODE : THE VISITOR () Stone Ocean. When unraveled, this thread can reach far. However, it becomes less powerful and inflicts less damage. When it bundles, it hardens. Its reach is reduced to about two meters. Can I break through the bars with Stone Ocean? No, it lacked the strength to do so. The most it could do was this. My mental energy is harnessed using the stone inside the charm. I'd like to get out of here using this power, but now's not the time yet. First, I need to learn all I can about this place. Hey, you. I'm talking to you! Sorry, but can you lend me some change? I've got some in my room, but the call is about to disconnect. I can pay you back as soon as I'm done. A dollar is all I need. I haven't spoken to my family in a while. Sure. Here. Thanks! You saved my skin! I'll pay you back for sure! Move, bitch! Don't try to cut in line! Hold on! I was waiting for her to finish for  minutes! I didn't see you waiting in line! Dumbass, you must be new. You've got to reserve these phones in advance. No one told me that! Well, now you know. Also, the reservations are made a month in advance. A month? Why should I wait a whole month for a few minutes of phone time? That's what's strange about prison, isn't it? Hey, I'll buy that spot on the phone from you. And this is the cause of the phenomenon. Hey, Mom! I want to call her. I need to hear her voice. The voice of my mom… Jolyne! How do you fare? Shut your trap! Keep away from me! I already told you I'm through with you! Don't push me away like that. I'm giving you a warning. You messed up big time just now. What? You just lent a dollar to that blondie, right? Get her to pay you back right now. No, your life here will be over if you don't get it back now. What are you saying? Of course, she'll pay me back. It was just a dollar. Hey, you said "just a dollar"! You're digging your own grave with that mentality! What? Listen closely, Jolyne. At the Aquarium, lending or borrowing money between inmates is one thing you should avoid at all costs. Even if it's just a dollar. Let's say that you fail to get the dollar back. You know what will happen? You'll become a bottom feeder like her. "Jolyne the newbie couldn't even extort back her dollar." The rumor will spread like wildfire and you'll be the target in no time. Just like her. One after another, every single day. Once you're out of money, you'll be forced to give your body and even your mind. Isn't that what hell on earth is like? Hey, now. You're exaggerating. Am I, now? It was "just a dollar" for her at first. See that blonde from earlier? She went to her room, but she's not planning on coming down for you. I'm telling you for your own sake. Got a minute? Oh, hello there. Apparently, this one's a classic. Have you read it? No. I'm here for the money. Are you ready to pay me back? Oh, of course. A dollar, right? I haven't forgotten. It's all in my head, don't worry about it. I'll pay you back later. You said you have the money in your room. You went back, right? Do you have it now? Shut up, you bitch! I said I'll give it back later. I don't have it now, you hear me? You a tightwad or what? Anyway, can you lend me ten more? I can call up friends on the outside and ask for more money! Please? You've got to have some on you. Come on, don't be shy! What's this… What the heck is this? I can't hold it in! Hey, you in there! Can you hurry it up? I know you're in there! I'll give you the dollar! -Please! -You'll pay me later, right? Don't worry about it. Take your time. I'll buy the time from you! I'll pay five… No, ten dollars! Sold! Sorry. That'll be ten dollars. Hey, you. Go use the bathroom next. Someone else will have the urge to use it soon. It's up to you whether you can get your money back, though. You're the only one who can save yourself. What the… What's going on? That's right, I'll be leaving soon. Somehow, I'll get out. Inmate number FE. I'm returning to my cell. Please unlock this door. Tomorrow at noon, you will have a visitor. But you must not meet him. You must not go to the visitation room. If you do, you and others will be in grave danger. A fate more terrible than death will happen. Who was that just now? How did a child sneak in here? Hey you! Didn't you hear my order to standby? Do not touch the bars! Stand back! Open the door. Right now! I said do not grab the bars! A visitor is coming tomorrow at noon. Not to see you, though, but someone in the next building, you know what I mean? That's the intel. Oh, by the way, you got it on backwards. Your pants, I mean. You're overreacting. Sorry about yesterday, FE. But it's your fault for grabbing onto the bars like that. Rules are rules. I had already let go. But you still hit me twice. What? Did you mutter something? Couldn't hear you. Never mind. How can I help you? Someone's here to see you. Stand up. I'll handcuff you. A visitor? Who is it, my mom? How the hell should I know? Give me your hands. Stand on the mark right there. I'll explain the rules. You have  minutes. You are allowed to hold hands, but kissing or undressing are not allowed. You will receive anything they bring after the visitation. Foreign languages are forbidden. Depending on the visit, the guard may choose to end it. Wait there until you're authorized. You mustn't go any further. Turn around. Go back to your room! It's not too late! Who are you? How did a child like you get in here? I don't quite understand either, but there are some things more fearsome than death. And it's happening at this very prison. So please turn back. Go back to your cell! No. My mom must be here to see me. I want to see her. She must be missing me too. I need to let her know that I'm doing well! Then take this. It should protect you. FE, all right. Enter! These are bones! Stop dawdling. Get in. Jolyne, did you receive the charm I asked your mom to give you? Dad… STAND NAME: STAR PLATINUM STAND MASTER: JOTARO KUJO Car and wallet theft. as*ault. This must be some mistake! My Jolyne would never… Since she's only , she won't be charged this time. You're headed to Tokyo? This is your daughter we're talking about! Why not go tomorrow instead? And you call yourself her father? Hello? Are you there? Jolyne, are you listening? Where's the pendant? I'd rather receive disciplinary action. Had I known it was you, I wouldn't have come here. Hey, open the door! sh*t, I hit him too hard. Get up! Good grief. Jolyne, listen up. It was not your boyfriend Romeo who conspired to frame you for m*rder and had you sent to this prison. Johngalli A. This man is incarcerated in the men's prison here. He's ex-m*llitary. A veteran sn*per who could hit his mark under any difficult circumstance. According to the report, his vision has deteriorated due to cataracts. This man was behind it all. Even that manslaughter accident. A henchman of Johngalli A. kidnapped an innocent hitchhiker and threw him in front of the car. He also hired a greedy lawyer to set up the trust-fund baby. Johngalli A. was pulling the strings from this prison. Help me, Jolyne! Do you know what a "plea deal" is? I love you! This court finds the defendant, -Jolyne Cujoh… -Fifteen years… Damn you! You hit me twice yesterday! Dammit! What's the point? Why would he plot my imprisonment? -Sit. -Answer me! I said sit. Listen. Johngalli A.'s target was you all along. It's so that he can eliminate you any time he wishes within these prison walls. Why is he after me? Because you are my daughter. You are of the Joestar bloodline. Joestar? The Joestar bloodline can be traced back hundreds of decades. And Johngalli A. plots to take revenge on our family. We are endowed with the wonderful gift to move others. But at times, powerful emotions leave dregs. Dregs called grudges, that is. In the past, I defeated a mortal enemy of the Joestar clan. Johngalli A. is a pawn of this enemy. We've never met, but I have no doubt about it. Though it's been over  years, Johngalli A. uses his fanaticism for this man to exact his revenge. I don't understand. I thought you were just a marine biologist. What's this about enemies and grudges? Just know that you are being targeted. I'll get you out immediately. We will bypass the law. Have you acquired your Stand yet? "Stand"? As my daughter, you are predisposed to the ability to use this power. Did you see any changes from the pendant I gave you? It seems you have. That's the Stand ability. Stand… Then you too? Use your power to get out. Okay? Quit your yapping. Don't try to act like a father now. So you're finally here to save me. What, because you love me? I've already forgotten about you. But fine, whatever. I'll keep that shocking story and the Stand ability in mind. You can go now. Don't ever visit me again. My handcuffs! When did I get out of them? Since when… The brand is different. The guard didn't even approach the table. Jolyne, get away from that door! Star Platinum: The World! Time, stop! What happened just now? Stay still! The fight has already begun. What's the layout to the right? Any windows in that direction? Two or three. But they're all barred. This is a real b*llet. This b*llet, called a sn*per Premium, is specific to r*fles. The sh*t was undoubtedly taken by Johngalli A. Hold on, I thought he was an inmate. Inmates are prohibited from even having pens. Is that so? But g*ns can be disassembled, you see. Precise parts may be snuck in through various objects. Guards can be bribed by his henchmen and the objects won't get searched. Little by little, slowly but surely. But we're in the women's prison! He can't possibly sh**t me from the men's! We're inside a building. There are obstructions! A r*fle and an ability make that possible. In other words, Johngalli A. is, without a doubt, a Stand user. Look. What's that? Keep your distance. Certainly, that's not just some rubbish. But it's moving away. It seems really light. It's just floating in the air. Don't engage it. First, we must know what it can do. It dodged! I said don't engage it. Can it see my thread? Don't be so loud. It's reacting to something. However, not to the thread. Its movement seems unrelated to the thread. Oh, could it be reacting to that? What was it called? The change in the air from the thread. Like, the movement of the air? Aerodynamics. It detected our positions using aerodynamics. All right, so he knows our location. But how can he sh**t us from the men's dormitory? That's the real problem. Jolyne, you were saved by a fortuitous accident. Do not make a move until we understand the contraption. Don't order me around! -I know that! -You… FE! You're done for, I'll have you know! Got it? Jolyne Cujoh! -What? -It's headed towards us! I'll make sure you get disciplined! Don't move! After I b*at you to death, that is! Calm down! Jolyne, don't leave the wall! I know! And don't order me! Let's knock him out before we get into more trouble! Damn you, who do you think you're talking to? You bastard! Jolyne!
05x04 - The Visitor (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:13Tomorrow at noon, you will have a visitor. But you must not meet him. You must not go to the visitation room. Someone's here to see you. Turn around. Go back to your room! Dad… Johngalli A. This man was behind it all. Johngalli A. is, without a doubt, a Stand user. Just know that you are being targeted. I'll get you out immediately. My handcuffs! When did I get free? Jolyne, get away from that door! Star Platinum: The World! Time, stop! What happened just now? Stay still! The fight has already begun. Aerodynamics. It detected our positions using aerodynamics. Do not make a move until we understand the contraption. Don't order me around. -I know that! -You… FE! Who do you think you're talking to? You bastard! Jolyne! -You… -Don't move! Keep your voice down. It'll detect our position again. Johngalli A. uses that Stand to read the airflow. It may even react to the change in our breathing. Plus, that Stand can be used remotely. He can sh**t at that Stand to reflect the b*llet to his target. It's a sniping Stand. We cannot att*ck Johngalli A., who is in the men's prison. We have to destroy that long-range Stand. Any damage dealt to the Stand is reflected on its user. I'm well aware. The problem is, the moment we move to prompt an att*ck, the Stand will detect our position and Johngalli A. will sh**t at us. Stay by the wall, Jolyne! It's detecting your location! Jolyne, what are you thinking? EPISODE : THE VISITOR () Your own muscles cannot be trusted. When skin comes in contact with a breeze, the muscles have a twitching reflex. This is an a*t*matic reflex you cannot control. Therefore, I use my bones to affix the r*fle. Bones land firmly on the surface. The g*n is as stable as the surface itself. Its stability is something we can trust. Meteorologists may argue that the direction of drafts cannot be predicted. That may be true, but only to an extent. Is this fly flying randomly? No. It flies while smelling things nearby and feeling the air current. The wind is the fly's movement. Just as the guard said, Jotaro Kujo is here. He's here to see his daughter, Jolyne Cujoh. The descendant of the Joestars is in the visitation room at this very moment. Within range of my ability, Downtown Transfer. Joestar… Joestar! My life will finally begin after I eradicate your family's blood! You will pay for robbing me of the one who was my rock! I see. You said we have to destroy it, right? Look at its movement. It can't detect the wind due to the precipitation. Now's my chance! Stone Ocean! No, wait! Look closer! It's evading every drop of water. It's reading the drops' air current to avoid them. Jolyne, go back to the wall! He's going to sh**t at us! This isn't good. Once the guards arrive, the air will stir! -Hey, listen! -What? Hurry, move the base of the pillar! Kick it with all your might! -But you're… -Don't worry about me. Got that? Please don't forget what I said. I want you to survive! I don't know why, but there's a descending hole between the walls. It seems to be a passage. Maybe it leads to the sewer or the vent. What is this? It may lead us to the outside. Let's go, Jolyne. Seems it's our only option. -It flew away… -No. It's still close. It's looking for the perfect angle to snipe us. No… It's following the boy on the other side of this door. He plans to hunt the boy because he helped us escape. Jolyne, go down the hole! I came to break you out! Before I entered this room… he grabbed this arm of mine. I'm sure of it. I can't believe it, but he's here. He was just an ordinary kid like you'd see at any park. And we don't know each other… We're complete strangers. But… he grabbed my arm with desperation in his eyes. The warmth of his hand even felt as if he cared about me. I'm going back inside. Before he sh**t the boy, I'll k*ll Johngalli A.! Good grief. To the visitation room! That's where the fire alarm went off! There are no cameras there. -Be prepared to engage! -Where did he go? That boy… How does he move through this place, appearing and disappearing out of nowhere? Hurry! To Visitation Room B! Did that boy dig this hole? This wall… So he used this! His height is about cm. His build is small, almost like a child's. I don't know who he is, but the hole that suddenly opened is a vent. I know where it leads by reading the air. However… I can't have this small guy guide Jotaro and his daughter deep underground where I cannot reach them! I will not lose those two again! I'll finish this small one first! Jolyne, our situation is too dire. Our Stands are only good for defense at the moment. Should we strike, Johngalli A. will read the movement of the air. This is too dangerous. Hey, you! You can't just leave the room! This side is the prison! -Good grief. -Leave from the other side! What the… There it is! Just as I thought, it's chasing the boy! But there aren't any windows here. How can he aim through the men's prison? No… However… This boy… Look at him! How smart! No, we're blessed! With his body submerged completely underwater, the air is unaffected! And, he's inside a pipe! Johngalli A. cannot find him now! Not only that, there are no windows down here. Surely he can't sh**t him now… The pipe is bursting! But how? Where is he aiming from? Could he be… Distance to the target is m. The b*llet drops .cm while airborne, and there's a slight ocean breeze of . meters per second. The b*llet will drift by .cm to the left. Finding its target. Targeting his heart. sh*t! Stone Ocean! Threads! Jolyne Cujoh… This is her Stand ability! She followed the boy down? Is she an imbecile! She thinks her net can stop my b*llet? Changing my target to Jolyne Cujoh. Targeting the forehead. Now, sh**t! How? I'm so glad I broke this pipe beforehand. The moment I came in, I punctured this gas line. Gas is lighter than air. It creates a layer of gas separate from oxygen. I thought it would obscure your aim. Man, was I right. How did she do this? You're too late! You're mine now! Stone Ocean! Seems you couldn't read your own fate. STAND NAME: DOWNTOWN TRANSFER STAND MASTER: JOHNGALLI A. Who are you? How is a child like you roaming freely about this prison? I hit myself. This bone. That's right. You gave me this. What is it? It looks like a bone. What's going on? You tried to stop me from going to the visitation room. Just what do you know? Hey, answer me! Not yet… I can't, yet. You mustn't let that go. This smell. Is this your doing? That sn*per guy, Johngalli A., his Stand? It was nothing once I got to it. I pounded it into a thousand pieces. I see. It seems you're quite used to fighting with your Stand. Not out of choice… There he is! Right there! He's on the move! Hide! He has a r*fle. He's hiding behind that pipe. I saw him going above the t*nk! That's impossible. He was targeting from the men's prison, which is  to m away. There are layers of bars between us. Not only that, he is almost completely blind. How do you suppose he traveled so fast? How the hell should I know? If I said he's here, he's here! Hide! He's directly above you! All right, I believe you. And get ready. The gas must have been accumulating. We did it! Hey, we're safe now! What the… Where did he run off to? Are you hiding? You don't have to be afraid anymore. Come out and explain what's going on! What are you doing? I'm looking for the boy. Did you see where he went? I don't understand what you mean. What boy are you talking about? Oh, I see. You didn't see him, did you? I was talking to a little boy outside the visitation room. Johngalli A. tried to get rid of him first. Get rid of him? What are you talking about? You came here on your own. And so I followed you. Hold on, our stories aren't matching up. You must have heard his voice. No, I know you did! He's the one who told us about the secret passage! You were there with me! Did you hear a ghost or something? I don't know of a secret passage. Damn you! You're messing with me at a time like this? You're here now because you followed me down the secret tunnel… Hold on… Something's not right with you. Your wound… You were sh*t. What happened to your wound? Wound? The b*llet wound from when Johngalli A. sh*t you! On your right shoulder. But you aren't bleeding, and your clothes… I don't have a scratch from being sh*t either! This man… He isn't Johngalli A.! He's the prison guard! But I saw him get sh*t through the head! His head is unscathed! What do you mean he was sh*t? And who is Johngalli A.? What's going on? Something's amiss. It's not adding up! What is this? A fate more terrible than death will await us all. You must not go to the visitation room. The visitation room… That's right. Something was off from the very beginning. When was I uncuffed? And that b*llet… Was I really sh*t back there? But my dad and I don't have a scratch. Was Johngalli A. attacking us to begin with? Something's wrong. Nothing is making sense! This isn't reality! I'm in a dream of some sort. No, I'm under someone's spell! This is… A dream… Was I… dreaming? Since when… It looks like I did knock out this prison guard. This photo of Johngalli A… Dad showed it to me. The accident with the hitchhiker. I heard that it was all a plot to imprison me. That was all real. And then I tried to leave the room. That's when I noticed I was uncuffed. That was the moment. No, I was sitting down when I awoke. So before then… We haven't stepped outside of this visitation room. In other words… Johngalli A.'s Stand was an illusion my mind created. The secret passageway too. The moment we stepped into this visitation room, we fell under their trap and were forced to dream. As if engulfed by a python, slowly but surely, we're being melted to the bone! The boy in the garbage can who gave me this bone. He was real! I was able to wake up because I cut myself on this bone! Without the pain from the cut, I would have stayed asleep. This ability is Johngalli A.'s att*ck! My thread! I can't unravel it, not even for a few centimeters! This is bad! Dammit. I'm getting sleepy again… We need to get out of here. Out of this visitation room! Stone Ocean!
05x05 - Prisoner of LoveQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:15EPISODE : PRISONER OF LOVE What's this? Looks like you're awake. Were we dreaming just now? Yes. And this substance is dissolving us. In this very room. Please break down the door… Use your ability, Star Platinum. Hurry! You did it! Now drag me out! Let's get out of here! Hold on. What did you just say? Did you say "Star Platinum"? That's my Stand name. How do you know that, Jolyne? From the looks of it, we started dreaming after I told you about Johngalli A. Which means you haven't seen my Stand ability yet. Since we are related, you may be feeling its presence, but you couldn't have known its name. It's not adding up! This is not reality! Stone Ocean… Jolyne. You finally woke up. That took too much effort. My thread melts fast. Jolyne… You were dreaming too. I don't know about yours, but mine was a terrible nightmare. I see. So we were both dreaming as if watching a movie. Guess so. It would've been perfect if only we had some popcorn. I can't move anymore. Not even a finger. What about you? Can you move? What we are perceiving could still be a dream. If you can't move at all, then we're awake. We are in this reality where we can't escape this room. I see. We'll die at this rate. The charm's ability… Show me the ability you used to wake me up. Stone Ocean. Yes. Can you materialize it? I mean your power. I understand, but it's no use. It was hard enough to wake you up. No way could I break down the door. No, just materialize it. That's it. Keep going. Can you bring it out a bit more? Move it slightly towards me. It'd be best if you could move it a bit more to the left. This will do. It's not ideal, but it's close enough. Now we can leave this room. That was my Stand, "Star Platinum." Pull me out. This isn't a dream. I'm certain of it now. Damn you… Bullshit… It hurts and I'm pissed. I can't believe you hit me. We got out, but I'm pissed! We're definitely not dreaming, all right! Okay, give me your hands. What now? Let's go. Oh, right. Do you know what this is? This bone saved our lives. It's a human bone. Plus, it's the sacrum from the pelvic area of an adult female. Its surface looks like it was dissolved with some kind of acid. Dissolved? Is that what was used on us? Can't say. I don't know why you have that bone, but it doesn't matter now. I was the only one who saw that boy, but he's definitely here! It's a mystery, but he's within these prison walls! Code , emergency level . Emergency alarm activated in the visitation room. Emergency level , code . What's your plan now? I guess now you're a criminal too. Like I told you, I'm breaking you out. You have the charm, don't you? It's crucial that you hold onto it. Don't lose it, no matter what. Let's go. We're leaving this place. Who would have thought that they would be able to escape this room. Is it just me? I don't see that many guards. This is a common area. Look at this. We'll escape through the window marked with an X. This window faces the beach. We'll board a submarine at the beach to escape this island. A submarine? I have an amicable relationship with a group called The Speedwagon Foundation. They have provided our way out. There doesn't seem to be a camera in this hallway. Our target window is one left turn away. Then we'll be about m away from the shore. I'm sure there is a lot to consider, but let's get out of here first. Let's go. It's just the fan. Jolyne. It hurts! Where are you looking? Stay calm. Stand up. What's the matter? Give me your hand. It's just that… Well, thanks, but I can stand up by myself. That's not what I meant. You almost lost this. Be careful when you trip. I told you not to lose this charm. What is it? I told you it's important. You must hold onto it. Take it. You're headed to Tokyo? This is your daughter we're talking about! And you call yourself her father? Hello? Are you there? You haven't changed a bit. You're calm and collected as ever. When I almost d*ed from a fever, you didn't come home to check on me. When I drove a car for fun and was accused of theft, you took a plane to Tokyo instead. Right. As long as I'm safe, you don't care, do you? Even now, I'm just a troublemaker that doesn't get hurt even if I fall! See? Lucky me, no harm done! Yahoo! What are you talking about? If it's that important, hold it yourself! Listen. Shut up. I don't want it! That's not it. Something is off. We're being quietly followed. Jolyne, duck. There's no one over here. They might have headed the other way. Oh, it's just a guard. Hey, look closely! The door is bent! The convicts have come this far! We are at-- That's… Johngalli A.! That bastard… He's here to finish us off himself! Jolyne! Head towards the window. I'll take care of him. That's Johngalli A.'s Stand! But the only time he ambushed us was in a dream. -Die! -Are we still dreaming? No! This is reality! Time stop! Our enemies… There are… two of them! Not only did he force us to dream, but he showed us Johngalli A.'s actual Stand within it! They had been preparing for this moment. The moment I have no choice but to use my Stand ability to protect my daughter! Their target was me all along! Time will move again. Jolyne! You were one move behind. Jotaro Kujo, I have been waiting for this moment! It was just ready for me. Perfect. I finally got what I've been after from Jotaro, the invincible Stand User! This is Pale Snake's ability! Those b*ll*ts! The Stand! How? I thought we only saw his Stand in our dream! Anyway, while he can't sh**t, I'll… I see the shore! We're close! Go on without me. I'll catch up. Were you actually… sh*t? Listen to me. A Stand User only controls one Stand. This means we are up against two enemies, Johngalli A. and the one who tried to dissolve us. Go on ahead. Take this charm. Don't drop it. A transmitter is implanted within it. It's there to track your location. The submarine is honed to follow the GPS signal. You understand what I'm saying, right? All you have to do is go to the beach. The submarine will come to you. And The Speedwagon Foundation I told you about will find you. If you understand, then go, Jolyne. This charm… But earlier, you… No. You couldn't have… I've always cared about you. What is it? Your chest… You're not… No, why? Go, Jolyne. It's just a little blood. I'll catch up soon. Liar! Earlier, you sacrificed yourself, and the enemy took something from you! That's why you couldn't evade the b*ll*ts, right? What did he take? Don't tell me… your Stand? Jolyne! What? These are… These threads! Since when? Take this! Shut up. We're about to leave from this window and head for the beach. Don't get in our way. Got that? You… When did she acquire such a Stand ability? An ability of this strength should have been reported before her sentencing! Very well. I will drop my g*n. I wasn't asking you to drop your g*n. I was just looking for the best angle. Your body's best angle to punch, that is. I only like it when your chin is tilted slightly to the right. Just now, I should have finished her first instead of Jotaro! Jotaro wasn't the one I should've gone for first. Does Pale Snake know about this? Jolyne Cujoh. Without a doubt, she is Jotaro Kujo's… She's a Joestar! Jolyne. Back then, in that dream… you said you'll stay behind at this jail for some child you barely just met. He grabbed my arm with desperation in his eyes. I'm going back inside. It was a mere dream I saw. But… Dad! Dammit, we're so close to the beach! Dad! Find them!We have permission to sh**t! A guard has been sh*t. The convict is armed. We can sh**t to k*ll! Where is it? I'm at the beach already. Where are they? That organization you're friends with, called The Speedwagon Foundation… I don't know who they are, but if they really did send us a submarine, then they must have incredibly advanced technology and financial power! A g*nsh*t wound like this… This foundation must be able to administer the care you need better than anyone else! Where is the submarine? Where is it? Everything you said was true. The submarine is already at the beach! We're saved… What the hell are you doing? You can't… No, this can't be happening. No, this isn't happening. He was sh*t, but it wasn't deep. It's not a fatal wound. It can't be a fatal wound. Then, Then his heart… Why isn't it b*ating? Now, I know. The Joestar blood runs in you. Jolyne, with your strong conviction, I know you'll be fine. Found them! Something's moving on the other side of the fence! Watch for the g*n! No, I'm not outside the fence. I'm right here if you're looking for me. You! Hold, don't sh**t! Her hands are up. -But… -Don't sh**t! She's unarmed. Are you surrendering? There must be another man. A tall man who visited her. He must be nearby. Find him! That's where you were. Why? Why didn't you run? I'm sorry, but your father is already dead. His spirit was stolen by that sludge. You barely managed to survive! Why didn't you leave? Why? The m*rder*r escaped inside the prison. Not outside, inside! The m*rder*r had planned to steal my father's Stand by giving it form. That's his ability! Then the m*rder*r retreated back into the prison. He won't leave this place. He is within these walls! Are you actually trying to get his ability back? Do you think it'll bring him back to life? That's precisely why I'm going back inside. I'm sorry to say this, but a corpse will only rot away. That melted bone I gave you belonged to my mother. That sludge stole her ability and she d*ed. I see. My mom was an inmate here and gave birth to me. I grew up in hiding within these walls. What's your name? I'm Emporio. Emporio. Your mother's bone saved my life. Thank you. But, I can't explain it, but I'm certain of it. My dad's not dead. If I get his Stand back, he will come back to life. That's why I'm going back! You've done it. You finally acquired this powerful Stand which can stop time! Yes, and I have you to thank, Johngalli A. We make a great team together. Please take me to the men's prison. I let my guard down. And have you seen my g*n? It's right here. You're the only one who knows who I am. You shall be my scapegoat for the m*rder of the guards. This way, everything works out peacefully. To be able to communicate something to someone... Jotaro had said that is a wonderful thing. I agree. And here, we have a way.
05x06 - Ermes's StickersQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:16Green Dolphin Street Prison. Also known as "The Aquarium." At some point in time, it had birthed mystery and power. Something unseen by ordinary men. Power and mystery drenched in filth. PUNISHMENT WARD Jolyne got five added years for her jailbreak and has been in the Punishment Ward for a few weeks. Everything will start afterward... Everything. INFIRMARY WARD Before that, I must investigate something. It concerns another inmate. Her name is… Ermes Costello. Jolyne has already met her. Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? Hey! I'm talking to you, bastard! Is this... the infirmary? EPISODE : ERMES'S STICKERS sh*t! That was the bathroom janitor. That was my hard-earned money. Dammit! Oh, I'm starting to remember now. I hurt my right palm. I had a fever too. But my hand is almost completely healed. Was I dreaming? Hold on. It's coming back to me now. Right before I got sent here to serve five years for the robbery I committed, I picked up that charm. It was in the washroom of the holding cell. But that charm cut my hand, so I got pissed and sold it to… What was her name again? Oh, I think she's called Gwess. Anyway, I sold it off to her. And that night… something caused me to pass out. I've been held here since. Have I been bedridden since? My hand is better too. Hold on, what just… Just now, I peeled off this sticker from my palm. Is my memory okay? In , Columbus discovers the Americas. Bugs Bunny's birthday is July th. No, my memory's fine. What the… I'm sure I peeled it off just now. Wait, what? My shoes… There are… One, two… three, four, five, six… Huh? What? Ouch! Ah, five of them? They're back to normal. Did the high fever cause astigmatism?! But that sticker just now... That's the sticker I tossed aside. No way… Gross! -What are you hollering about? -Keep it down, will you? It's nothing. Go back to sleep. sh*t. No. I didn't get astigmatism from my fever. I'm definitely touching the shoe, and I feel its weight. This sticker… When I attach it to an object, the object is duplicated. Once you peel it, there's a bit of destruction, but it merges back into one. And this sticker… I know it sounds crazy, but there's no doubt about it. It emerged from inside my body! And now that I've accepted it, it's quite useful. This is awesome. No point in overthinking it. This sticker emerges from my palm. This is reality. assh*le. Give me my money back. What is this… He left… He didn't seem to notice it. I grabbed it without thinking. This disc… What does it do? Your fever has gone down. You may now return to your cell. Well, I have a question. The bathroom janitor. Is he a model prisoner? What's his-- And what will you do with that information? Next! The janitor inmate? How the hell should I know? No idea. It's not a CD, but it's shaped like one and even reflects light like a disc. But it's soft and elastic. Also, I saw another disc on his face. There were two of these on him. What's this? It's projecting something. The money I took from the sick inmates. They're mine now. All , dollars. No one will ever find them here. This image… McQueen. Would you like to cooperate as my partner? McQueen! What did I just see? It's as if I was watching someone's memory! I heard… you've been sneaking around asking about me. I've stalked before, but I've never been stalked by a woman. Yes, this is a first. And who the hell are you? I saw those discs sticking out of your face! Discs? What? I can't remember a thing! What discs? I'm such a loser! I can't remember a thing! What got you crying all of a sudden? You took my money at the infirmary. Just this morning! Money? That's right. I had a huge sum of money, and I hid it somewhere. But… I forgot where I hid it! Hey, are you all right? Are you messing with me? Did you just ask if I'm okay? How nice! It's been ages since I last spoke with a woman! No, it's a first. I've never had a heartfelt conversation with a woman before. I'm in bliss right now. I hope I can spend the rest of my life with a wonderful lady like you someday. What the hell? But that'll never happen. I'm pathetic, aren't I? Yes, I'm trash. I want to die. What… What the hell are you doing? What is this? This thing! STAND NAME: FREEWAY THRU HELL STAND MASTER: THUNDER MCQUEEN McQueen… You have pure evil within you. You have no malice or animosity. You think you don't inconvenience others. You victimize yourself, and you have no interest in others, yet you're always wishing for someone to save you. But that's precisely why you are the worst. You drag others down with you. You are the purest form of evil. I really like you, McQueen. If you ever find my enemies within these prison walls, you will surely clean them out and take care of them for me. Dammit! He hanged himself... and now my neck... Someone! Someone help! I'm passing out... Maybe if I bring his body down, my body will be lowered too? Sticker. He has strange powers like I do. So there are others like me! Dammit. Just who the hell are you? Why did you hang yourself? Did you save me? I owe my life to you. Who the hell are you? What do you want from me? I know you have some sort of ability! An ability? I don't know what you mean. But don't worry. I won't do that again. I can see clearly now. And I owe you for saving my life. I'll repay you someday. Don't worry about that. It was nothing. What the hell are you doing? What is this? Those scars… He must have suicidal tendencies! And he himself is unaware of his ability. This is bad. I'm even in the same position as him. Dammit, I'm farther away from him now. You bastard! Dammit! The disc! I don't understand what's going on, but it's got to do something with those discs! Let me die. I said I'd repay you, but a guy like me would never be able to do that because I'm trash! I don't want anything to do with you! Stay away from me, or I'll k*ll you! Please do! I wouldn't mind being k*lled by a beautiful woman like you! It looked like she picked up a disc from the bathroom floor. For some reason, I think it belonged to me. I wonder if she'll give it back. No, probably not. Let me pass! I have permission to leave. I'm returning to the women's prison. Dammit! I need to get as far away from that psycho as possible. I need to get back to my cell. I knew it. So your powers have awakened. I'll tell you one thing. That power that awakened within you… It's called a Stand ability. Stand abilities are drawn to one another like gravity. It happens without reason. That's why you ran into that janitor. Why is there a kid?! You picked up and sold Jolyne's charm. That's why she told me to keep an eye on you. You know Jolyne? What happened to her? Our enemy has the ability to steal souls. We are looking for a soul he stole. A soul? The culprit's name is Pale Snake. Please tell me anything you know. Soul? Could you be talking about this disc? That disc! This belongs to the janitor. What's the significance of these discs? Did he have two discs? Two discs? He did. A memory disc and a Stand disc. Discs come in pairs. Two discs make up a soul. If only we can get his other disc, we may be able to learn the identity of Pale Snake! Hell no… No way! It's still following me around. Dammit! I thought I got far enough. What's happening? Electricity! That bastard! He's electrocuting himself! It... It stopped. Electrical resistance. You can't k*ll a person just by sending  volts of electricity on human skin. We have electrical resistance. That's why it stopped. His su1c1de attempt failed. But… if he wants to electrocute himself again, he'd be looking around for some saline solution right about now. Saline solution would increase conductivity to almost  percent. Electricity can pierce and burn the heart completely. Saline solution? They are used as IVs and disinfectants. There's a bunch by the infirmary! I can't go any further. There are too many inmates by the stairs! I'll b*at him up and take his other disc. That's my only way! Stop! Don't do this! Look at my left arm! It's a little burnt, just like your arm. You have obtained a strange ability. Every su1c1de attempt is reflected onto me! Don't think about su1c1de! There are lots of fun and lucky things in life too! Four years ago, I was only cleaning. Cleaning the shotgun in my apartment. But for some reason, the g*n was loaded. The g*n accidentally fired. I live on the tenth floor. Just as the g*n went off, a woman jumped to k*ll herself. It was like the lottery. While some win millions of dollars, I guess sometimes the exact opposite happens. She was supposed to hit the ground and die. Everyone thought that I aimed at and k*lled the woman on the th floor. The judge even called me cold-blooded. That's the kind of man I am! Hold on! Oh, panties. Has anyone given you panties before? Wouldn't you feel lucky if a girl gave you her panties? You're going through tough times right now. But imagine. If a girl gives you panties, that means lucky things can happen even at the worst moment. Oh, I'm so embarrassed! But you can have it. I'll give you the one I got on right now! You'll really give me your panties? I keep my promises. But remember this. Everyone hates Mondays. We all hope for the fun Saturdays to come around. Not every day is a Monday! I was arrested on a Saturday. You're saying nice things to give me hope, but I bet it's just lip service to save yourself. That's not… You are pretending to be kind just to get out of this situation. You don't mean a word you say. Am I wrong? That's how everyone always treats me. Nobody likes trash. But I'm worse than trash. My presence is invisible to everyone! Hold on! Yes, I'm talking to you because I don't want to die. But listen up. You are being used by Pale Snake. He's exploiting your mindset! If you don't think about su1c1de, nothing will happen! You are the one who's being selfish, you bastard! You really are a nice person. How wonderful. Those words were sincere. I sure am fortunate. I ran into such a beautiful woman before my passing. Thank you! If I can die with you… If I can spend an eternity with you, then I'm really blessed! He's evil. He is, without a doubt, rotten to his core! I'm not lonely! -Here! -Bastard! Let go of that switch! That was close. Too close, dammit! I managed to attach the sticker. It'll burn from the sparks of electricity. Once the sticker burns off, the copy created with the sticker will… merge back to one! Goddammit. The shock made me remember. He hid the money he stole, , dollars. I'll take it as payment, you little sh*t. And then there's Pale Snake. I went through this because of him. Just what are you planning? ERMES COSTELLO, STAND NAME: "SMACK" I have to go see her. Jolyne… Jolyne Cujoh.
05x07 - There’s Six of Us!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:17His heart… Why isn't it b*ating? My dad's not dead. If I can get his Stand back, he'll surely come back to life. I'll tell you one thing. That power that awakened within you… It's called a Stand ability. I have to go see her. Jolyne… Jolyne Cujoh. PUNISHMENT WARD I see. So Ermes has learned about Stand abilities and about the discs too. When Ermes inserted McQueen's memory disc back into him, he came back to life. He was resuscitated. We may be able to bring your father back if we have his discs! And what did you do with this janitor's discs? I'm keeping them safe. I have both discs. She said the guards would find it during body checks if she brought them to her cell. I'll hold on to his Stand ability, but I'll insert his memory disc back later. McQueen's memory disc. This disc contains memories related to Pale Snake. And maybe memories of Dad's discs too. It's coming! Hurry, shut the door! I was only trying to change the tractor's tire! I barely touched it! Hurry! Hurry, get out of there! We need to close this door! Come on, help me! Okay! It's heavy! Pull harder! It's almost closed. Now, pull! What the hell are you doing? I said pull harder! Those aren't my arms… Bro! I know. I was the one… who didn't pull hard enough-- EPISODE : THERE'S SIX OF US! Fine weather, as always. Tell me, Charlotte, what is this commotion for? Why did we call this assembly? This afternoon, two inmates went missing on the farm grounds. Is that so? That's not good. The prisoners could not have escaped from the farm grounds. They must have drowned in the surrounding wetlands or gotten bitten by venomous snakes. I think we need to assemble a search party. Why don't you talk about the possibility of them being eaten by a crocodile? Maybe a female crocodile. Who was that? What did you say?! I did not eat them! I am innocent! Anyways. I have called you here to form a volunteer search party. You will not be compensated, nor will your sentence get shortened. I'd like to ask for your compassion. Are there any volunteers? Come on, Jolyne. You just got out of the Punishment Ward. Why would choose to tire yourself more? Because you won't be there. What? Very well. A party of five is plenty. Guard, bring the usual please. Inmates going to the farm must wear this on their wrists to prevent escape. "Like a Virgin." Also known as "invisible wall." In trying to take the bracelet cuffs off you give it impact, or if it breaks, it will explode immediately. Furthermore, if you stray farther than  meters from me, it will explode. It would be difficult to wipe your asses without your arms. Let's go, all five of you! Fifty meters? We're supposed to run? Wait up! Hey! All right, we'll split up here and start the search. The grassy area there is a marsh. There could be crocodiles, so watch out! They wouldn't be here. Why did you volunteer, Jolyne? Well, it works well for me. There are plenty of things I have to ask you. About the disc and about the guy named Pale Snake. Did you try it out? Did you read McQueen's disc? Yes, I gave it a try, but it made me feel terrible. It felt as if a stench was entering my brain. -Then you haven't noticed. -What? The image within the disc contained clues on Pale Snake's aim. McQueen. This disc will suit you. It's yours now. This is now your Stand ability. They're stored in one of the farm tractor tires? You saw a bunch of them there? His aim is to collect the discs. He was collecting Stand abilities and memories he stole from other Stand users. There are dozens of discs. He has to keep them hidden from the prison guards and other prisoners. That's why he has them hidden in a tire. My father's Star Platinum and memory discs might be stashed there. What? Father? So you're searching for your father's discs? Sorry, but I don't know anything more about him. I'll look for the tractor from the disc. A tractor? There's a good number of them here. -That shed. -Right. Hey! You two seem to be enjoying yourselves. You think this is a picnic or something? You're not searching at all! No, we were discussing that shed over there. We'll go search there. You made us run after you on purpose. Who's the one having fun here? Hold it! Did you mutter something? Oh, it's nothing. I swore to run around like a dog and search. I don't like her. Crocodile feces. I said hold it! You disrespectful bitch! I'm the guard here! Oops. That was an accident. The stick accidentally hit it, right? What is this sound? Why is my bracelet beeping? That wasn't on purpose. You ran into me. It won't explode, will it? That was a bad joke. Do something about it! Hey now, stay away from me. What if it explodes the moment you come near me? Hold on. I said I'm sorry! I'm apologizing! Watch it! I said don't come near me. I said, make it stop-- Boom! Yes! That's what you get! Eat crocodile sh*t! It stopped. Come on. Don't panic and trip, Ermes. That sound was a warning. Right, Mr. Prison Guard? Dammit… So that was your ability, huh? Come on. There's only a tractor and bags of flour in here. There's no point in looking inside. If this was an easy assignment, then there was no need for volunteers. Seriously? There it is, Jolyne! It's the same tractor. That's the same tractor I saw on the disc. The number is the same too. STAND NAME: STONE OCEAN STAND MASTER: JOLYNE CUJOH The same vehicle number. It says four. They're inside that tire. We can get to the discs if we remove the tire. Listen up! We will now sweep the wetlands! The missing inmates could have drowned in the waters. You will go look! Hey, there's no way I'm going in the water. I'm not going. Let's go! Guess that vehicle is amphibious. Give me a break. Who knows what sort of disease we'll catch in the wetlands! What a pain. Now's our chance. Let's remove the tire now! Hey, Jolyne. Doesn't something seem off? No, something is definitely wrong. Yes, if we don't remove the tire now, we would be separated from the guard. No, that's not what I mean. He said, "Five is plenty." That Warden. He said five inmates are enough. but there are six of us! Jolyne, what could this all mean? Including you and I… there's six of us here! I know there were only the five of us when we left. But I wasn't paying attention to how they looked. Jolyne, what do you think? I can't say. I was fixed on catching up. But then, everyone's wearing a bracelet. That's strange. Were there six of us right from the start? Hey, you think this is odd too? There should've been only five of us, right? Can you tell who joined us and when? No, I could be mistaken. And it doesn't matter how many of us there are. She's been with me the entire time. I remember her. She's Atroe. She gets picked on a lot. She volunteered to escape the bullying. Right? I don't know you. Hey! What's going on? Why is my bracelet beeping? Crap, mine is too! -Mine too. -What the hell? They're all beeping. We must be nearing the -meter limit. But he can't be that far off. The guard is gone! Where did he go? The ATV is covered in blood. Why is that? The bracelet won't stop beeping because the guard's body is getting farther away from us. Did he fall in the water and being washed away? Find the guard! He must be within  meters! This is bad! Hey. My bracelet's beeping faster! No way. She's dead. No way. Did the additional person att*ck? Is it because we got close to the discs? Look  meters away opposite from the girl that just exploded! There he is! Get near him! The bracelet will stop beeping and it won't explode either. Keep your guard up, Jolyne. Our enemy is among them. Someone's a real psycho. She looks suspicious to me. The woman with the shaved head. And Atroe didn't recognize her. It must be her. Her Stand ability must have k*lled him. We'll k*ll her before she gets us! Calm down, Ermes. Say that the shaved woman is the culprit, so she was guarding the discs in the shed since before we got here? That's what it would mean. That's impossible. She's an inmate. An inmate can't keep watch /. Jolyne, stand back! -Something's there! -What? Just step back. Get away from the water! Ermes. -Did you see something? -No. It was nothing. But I'm not getting in the marsh anymore. And Jolyne. We can't be separated, no matter what. We don't know who the enemy is. Right. And these bracelets complicate things. To take the discs from the shed, we must be within  meters of the guard and the other three inmates. Ermes! Something's in the bucket! My face got sucked in! What is this plankton-looking thing? What? It split into two. No, four! These creatures… The bucket wasn't empty. I didn't look hard enough. They were already in the water. Smack! Ermes! Jolyne, don't come in! The water is not safe! They're multiplying! They can rapidly multiply. Get out of the water. You won't make it in time. I fell into the Stand's trap. Stone Ocean! I'll get him now. Jolyne. You're walking on the thread? Doesn't that mean you're unraveling your own body? Jolyne, stay away! I'll take care of myself! This is crazy! It's true. Yes, it's pretty crazy. Good grief. I would've been toast if I hadn't unraveled so much thread. So this is your power. Her body has a hole in it. She let him punch her so she could grab onto him. Jolyne, get out of the water now. Don't stand up, Ermes! That thing. It's a bunch of small Stands clustered together! It hid inside the tiny bit of water in the bucket, and it dragged me in! I know that. So don't stand up. Grab it underwater. The thread that I'm releasing! It's fast. It's powerful too, but its speed... Just what is it? A Stand's speed and power should weaken… the farther it separates from its user. It got me! Stay calm, Jolyne. I put my sticker on it. When I was caught in its arms earlier. This is my Stand ability. I'll peel it off now! Run further inland! It's not coming onto land. Seems it only att*cks in the water. Please respond! This is inmate FE. This is an emergency. The guard got in an accident. Send help immediately! What happened to you two? It looked like you were running on water… You three, don't take another step! Step away from the water! Don't try to pull anything on us. I know one of you did this! In order to obtain the discs, it seems we have to defeat the User first.
05x08 - Foo Fighters / F.F.QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:18You three, don't take another step! Step away from the water! Don't try to pull anything on us. I know one of you did this! Did what? The one who k*lled the guard and tried to drown us! I know it's one of you! We really need to figure out who snuck in, or we're all toast! What are you talking about? I said don't move. Atroe said she didn't recognize you. What about you two? Do you recall seeing her from the start? I don't recall your faces either. Come on, you know I've been here right from the start. I don't remember your face. Hey! No one remembers you either, bitch. I'm the one who called help over the radio just now. You could be trying to trick us. Wait a second. You, with the black hair. You've got a nosebleed. What the… I couldn't see well, but… Ermes, when I punched the enemy Stand earlier, someone almost collapsed. Step back. Stand away from the water. Hold on, you've got it all wrong! This bitch punched my face just now! Look at her! She's bleeding too. What the hell? Her tooth scratched my arm! I was definitely here right from the start. The culprit is one of these two! Listen, I remember what happened with that crocodile warden! You're the one who caused a scene! She did do that. You guys are just as suspicious… Jolyne! Was it this bitch that att*cked us? How did you figure it out? Well, to be honest, I have no clue who the k*ller is. So I'll just b*at you all up! You… You bitch! She's… I was going to finish you off one by one in the water. Who would've guessed she had a thread ability and would survive the att*ck? Just what are these people? They all k*lled him? What's going on? Who's the actual Stand User? You're wrong. One Stand User for each Stand ability. The women who were here from the start were the black-haired and the shaved-head one. I finished them off because they approached the tractor. I then took over their body and mind. This body, I created it… using the missing inmates' flesh! EPISODE : F.F. The black sludge is gathering from those two. The divided parts of me have now formed into one. For the ability and the intellect Pale Snake's discs have enabled me, I will protect myself at any cost. It is my duty to eliminate those who approach the storage shed. Dammit. Where is the Stand User? You're misunderstanding it, Ermes. He is the Stand User himself. What? He is an organism. He is a living creature who received life and power through the discs. The guard of the discs wasn't human. A living creature? You mean, that conglomeration of those tiny things? It must be using the water in the bodies of its victims to move on land and guard the shed. It stays on land by dividing and multiplying. However, as a car needs gasoline, it needs water to live. To acquire the discs, we need to keep this creature out of the water and defeat it! But Jolyne, how can a tiny flea-like thing talk? F.F. Call me by my name! An astronomer named Fred Hoyle once said, "It is probabilistically wrong to assume that life was born spontaneously on Earth. The power of intellect already existed in this universe, and it created the origin of life." Meaning intellect existed long before the Big Bang, and all substances and organisms already possessed intellect. What is he blabbering on about? He's trying to say that humans are not the only ones with intellect. Even plankton have memory-- I told you to call me F.F.! I am a being of superior intellect than you! This is bad. He's trying to hide the discs before we can get to them. If he buries them underground, we'll never be able to find them! Jolyne, we're in trouble here. Look behind you. That's the creature that att*cked us from the water. He's trying to drag the guard's body. Remember the bracelet? We must stay within  meters of it. It's over, Jolyne. Let's give up on the discs. We must get the guard's body! The bracelet will explode. I'll leave the bracelet to you, Ermes. What? While I run  meters, you protect the guard's body and drag it within my safety range! That's the only way! Hey, I said wait! What a woman. She's nuts! Why would she leave that to me? But, dammit. If it takes the guard's body, then it's over for Jolyne and me. I need to act now! I did it, dammit. But I'll never use the sticker like this ever again. I'll never create another arm for myself. This will hurt, dammit. I just have to carry him within  meters of the shed… Water. You little worm! That holler… You think you've won? This is the corpse your original dried out to the bone. This corpse has zero moisture. My sticker has split it into two. When I remove the sticker… You sure absorb water like a tampon. Or should I say, a drop of water in a desert? Shut up! You're in the way! Scram! Jolyne. We need to dehydrate it. That's the only way to win against these tiny bastards. You made it in time. Either way, I will k*ll you two. I was planning to ask you questions after hiding these discs. But very well. Let me ask you this. Will you jump into the puddle? Or will you try to run? Which death do you prefer? I have questions as well. The one who knows what you are. Is it Pale Snake? Also, what is his aim and reason for collecting the discs? How interesting. I understand the logic behind an offensive defense. And fighting to protect your friends, I can't relate, but it's also within reason. However, I don't understand why you'd come here to die. Well, Pale Snake, was it? Who knows? I've never seen him. You thought I was distracted, you fool? These puddles are already a part of me! Did you plan to break this bag of flour and absorb water? Either way, I fully understand my ability and have created the optimal environment for myself. It may not be so bad to use your body as a host for a while. No. You've already lost. This environment you've created by spilling water everywhere… It will lead to your defeat. You didn't even hear me start the tractor using my threads. The sound was drowned by the water. You got distracted with k*lling me. And now, you've failed to guard the discs. You… Damn you! I cannot allow you to have them! Those discs are my… The dirt in the field is much softer than that of the wetlands. Water is getting absorbed from its body. And there won't be water at the end point! I won't let you lay a single finger on those discs-- Jolyne won this battle of wits. The discs don't belong to you anymore. You're finished! Dry up and become feed for the crops! Jolyne. Jolyne, what the hell are you doing? I'll give it water. Let's just say, I'm saving it. What? F.F. He wasn't guarding the discs out of loyalty to Pale Snake. I know that now. Though it knows its body will wither away, it chased after the discs. It was guarding the discs to protect its own existence. The discs gave it ability and intellect. It risked his life for the gratitude it has, to be able to exist. It could care less about Pale Snake. Hey, you want to save it? It k*lled five people! And it's literally not human! If it's not human, then it doesn't understand evil. Pale Snake is the evil one. Pale Snake only gave it the information that would allow him to take advantage. What? And I have another reason for saving its life. I made a deal with you. These discs, I want you to keep them safe. But do it for us. Keep them out of Pale Snake's hands. My intention is not to take those discs from you. I only want my father's discs back. And I want to know what Pale Snake is scheming to do. Well? Will you help us? But no more k*lling humans. Dammit. You really are something. I don't quite understand your feelings, but I no longer feel like fighting. And, I have lost… completely. DISC OBTAINED SUNBURN (NO CORPSE) SHAVED-HEAD (NO CORPSE) BLACK-HAIRED (BONE-DRY CORPSE) ATROE (DEATH FROM expl*si*n) STAND NAME: F.F. STAND MASTER: F.F. So the discs really were stored in the tire! We finally found them! This is Star Platinum! Jolyne! Are you okay? Hey! I have no doubt about it. This is Star Platinum's disc. My father, Jotaro Kujo, can be resuscitated with it. It's finally in my hand! But I don't see his memory disc. Where could it be? Hey. If I jump out of that window, do you think I'll die? Come on, it's just me. It's me! F.F., just call me that. I recovered whatever remained of her. I wore another inmate's bracelet. I want to use this body as a host for a while. This hand is useless, though. Take over her life? You mean, you'll live in her cell as a prisoner? Jolyne, I want to protect you. According to the memory in this body, her name is Atroe. Inmate number FE. Her childhood dream was to get kidnapped. But when she grew up, she ended up kidnapping a child. She wasn't after the ransom. She doesn't know why she did it. What the… Your arms are bleeding. Do they hurt? But I can't heal them. -What the hell? -Gross! Water! You might want to wait on going inside the prison. How about practicing drinking from a cup first? A cup? That's a piece of cake! Drinking from a cup is nothing. Gross. Hey, I wanted to ask you about Pale Snake. Does he come to this shed often? No, he barely swings by. I've never seen his user either. The discs stored here are the ones he doesn't use. No matter how strong the Stand, the body rejects the disc if you're incompatible. So all the discs are the ones he cannot use. He must have another hiding place for the important ones. And that's why the memory disc you're seeking isn't in this pile. What he really wanted from your father wasn't an invincible Stand ability but his memory. It must be one hell of a secret. Secret… The guards are here. What are you going to do, Jolyne? You have the Star Platinum disc. My next step is to deliver this to the foundation treating my father. If I don't resuscitate him soon, his body will begin to rot. And I'll find his memory disc no matter what it takes. Deliver it outside of this prison. It's harder to get things out of here than in. And the guards will soon conduct a body check. Let me see that disc for a sec. I'll just make my boobs a bit bigger. Ta-da. F.F., raise your hands or you'll get sh*t. Ermes, you too. The guard was att*cked by a crocodile. We saved him. We don't know what happened to the other inmates. That's the story we're sticking to, okay? She was just bait. Jolyne was just bait to attract Jotaro. I believed she would be harmless. Jolyne Cujoh. Did she defeat the guard by herself and take the discs? Could it be that the surviving inmates aided Jolyne? Hey, it's already sundown. You must return to the prison soon. Are you that worried about the missing inmates, Father Pucchi? A moment, please. I will be staying here until I give the sacrament on Sunday.
05x09 - Debt Collector Marilyn Manson / Debt Collector Mary Lynn MansonQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:18Father, my incarceration has taught me how foolish I had been in the past. I couldn't restrain my greed and continued to steal. I'm ashamed of myself. It's all thanks to you, Father. Could I please ask for your assistance in receiving parole? Recent studies have revealed… that proper training can teach even dogs and parrots how to read, utilize fire, and understand art. If that is the case, then what is the difference between man and animal? What do you think? I'm not sure. Anyway, about my parole… Excuse me. -Hey. -Got it. The point is, after finishing the first cherry and leaving it in your mouth, which tooth would you bite the second with? You must not bite the first pit while eating the second cherry. Sure… And what about my parole? I think there's a possibility. Do you really, Father? I will recommend you to the committee. Thank you, Fa-- I quite like your mischievous habit of theft. Truly, an evil disposition cannot be corrected. However, I cannot deny this talent. You will prove useful to me. I cannot let Jotaro's Stand leave this prison, after all. EPISODE : DEBT COLLECTOR MARY LYNN MANSON What the hell? What do you mean F.F. is hiding it? It's an important disc containing your father's Stand, right? Are you fine with not knowing where she's hiding it? -How do we know we can-- -This place is fun! -It's not like the wetlands at all! -Really, now. I want to play too. It's called "catch," right? I trust F.F., and Pale Snake doesn't know that she's alive. It's the safest place. You're right. But it would be even better if you could deliver the disc to him. I know. But I'm not allowed visitors or phone calls because I attempted to escape. And I don't have a plan to carry it out yet. Hey, you! That's my drink! What's the matter with you? I'm thirsty. Put that cup back on the bench now! If it's that important to you, then don't put it down. Especially in here. F.F., I'll bring you more water! Don't cause any trouble! Give it back! Oh, well. I ended up with more water. Lucky me! All right, let's get back to playing. -Jeez. -What? You've never thrown a ball, have you? Oh, crap. Tuck your hips in. A bit more. You got it. Your form's looking better already. Jolyne, did you know that we've tossed the ball  times now? We haven't dropped it at all. Think we can reach a hundred? A hundred dollars says it won't last. I bet  dollars. Sorry, but who are you? What do you mean  dollars? I'm Miraschon, inmate FE. I'm betting  dollars that you won't be able to make it to the th throw. Where did that come from, all of a sudden? I'm just k*lling time. Let's do it! We only have  more throws! You keep quiet! I don't have that kind of money. I can't match this wager. You can bet any item. Tobacco, dr*gs, gum, a phone call, a vibrator… I'll accept anything valuable. Let me be frank. I'm not betting on anything. Hold it. Jolyne, we should accept this bet. It's a chance to make money. You can use my money. F.F. might suck at playing catch, but still managed to continue to . We can win! Come on, Ermes. You suspect that this is Pale Snake's trap. But I know that Miraschon because we're on the same floor. She's the greedy self-destructive type that kept committing petty theft. Think about it. Even after your restrictions get lifted, you need to buy your time on the phone. So, gonna play or not? I want to give it a go! We can win this! Good. But you don't have  dollars, do you? If you raise your voice or get too close, the bet is immediately off. Got it? The wager has already begun. But it wouldn't be fair for me if you play too close or hold onto the ball too long. We'll stay at least three meters away and throw within ten seconds. Good. Time to play ball! Let's go. Don't rush and take your aim. You have a whole ten seconds before you throw! Eighty-nine. Only  more throws to go! Bitch, stay away from my cup! F.F.! That was close. Come on, focus! It wasn't my fault! It's her! She got near my water! I'm just enjoying the show. Just stay away from my cup! All right. Five more seconds. F.F., throw the ball! -Damn, she's distracting me! -Hey! I'll hold your cup for you. -One second left. -F.F.! Idiot! Jolyne! That was close, but she caught it. Sorry, I panicked. Be careful next time, F.F. I'm fine now! See? A hundred throws! Good. I can go another hundred throws! See? An easy win. Now, give us the  dollars. Hold on, she made a wager with F.F. too. That makes it  dollars. That's true. She owes us  dollars. Now, cough it up. A thousand dollars if you throw a hundred more. You heard me. I said let's play for , dollars. Are you serious? Do you even have that much money? Of course, I do. But like I said, I'll take anything valuable too. The rules will be the same as last time. What do you say? No, I'm done playing with you. I'm going to be frank. There's something I don't like about you. -If you want to wager, go play else-- -I'll play. Good. F.F., hand me the glove and the ball. -Okay! -Ermes, no! Jolyne, you're right, she is suspicious. Especially the way she insists on betting. But… we can potentially make , dollars. There's no way we can pass that up. Be careful, though. The game begins the moment you agree to play. Might be  seconds soon. -Ermes! -F.F.! More easy money. Thirty. Thirty-one. Thirty-two. Great, the next one makes it . Inmates, put away your exercise equipment! Recess time is over! Five… F.F.! Thirty-three! Bitch! What's with that attitude?! Hey, this bet is off. Got that? Let's say that a meteorite falls from the skies above into this yard right now. Then, you'll persuade to end the game, blaming it on the meteorite. Not to convince me, but yourselves. Does that sit well with you, though? Maybe you ran out of time because you took too long to throw the ball. If you can honestly say that you didn't break the rules of the game, then go ahead, end this game. Dammit… Ermes, you know you'll be thrown in the Punishment Ward. Please, mister. Give me five… No, three minutes. I'll make another round, so finish up in two minutes. F.F., hurry! But a measly  dollars only pays for the ball. I'm putting the glove away. Give it to me! What? Goddammit! sh*t… I attached a sticker to it in case something like this happens! Ermes! Whoa! Let's keep playing. I'm just watching. I won't interfere or object. And I can't prove anything, but… Ermes… She knows what she's done. Without a doubt, she violated the rules of the game just now. I know this because Mary Lynn Manson, the debt collector, appeared. Ermes! She's a Stand User! Mary Lynn Manson will always collect the debt no matter where you hide it, or what it is. All of it. That's not enough. Smack… It's game over. Ermes! Ermes… If I sell this liver on the black market, it will compensate for the remaining  dollars. Bastard! Take this! I am the shadow of Ermes's conscience. You cannot att*ck me. Ermes broke the rules and lost the bet. I only collected her debt. If you have any other valuables, I can exchange it for this liver. The bet's not over yet. What? One thousand throws. If I win, give back everything you took from her. Everything. Good. However, I hope you are prepared to wager something as valuable. I'm aware. Very well. The game has already started. I shall see you again. F.F.! Jolyne. Ermes, this wasn't your fault. Miraschon is a Stand User. Pale Snake must have a hand in this. She must be here to collect my father's disc from me. Then you really shouldn't play this game. You got caught in me and my father's problem. I can't let you die. But what are you going to do? A thousand throws? That Stand seems invincible. You're right. We'll chase Miraschon herself and b*at her! The Stand may be invincible, but Miraschon isn't. That's why she ran. Let's go! She's here. She must have entered this room. There's a door to the back. Maybe she escaped that way. F.F.! Jolyne, don't throw it yet! Crap! F.F.! It's coming towards you! Where is it? I can't see a thing! Don't move! The ball will hit you! Whoa! I got it! That was too close! Great job, F.F. Now, calm down so you can throw it back. I'm right here! -Where are you? -Hurry! It's over for them. F.F.! I don't have time for this! F.F. I sh*t towards the direction of her voice. I didn't even aim! Dammit! What is she? Lockdown will soon commence. All inmates must return to their cells. Prepare for headcount. I repeat! She ran to the right! How unfortunate. You can't run anymore. Now that we know that you are a Stand User, I won't hold back. Wait, I'll give it all back. The liver… and the money too! That's not enough. Who gave you that Stand ability? What? Pale Snake. It was him, wasn't it? I want to know who his User is. What are you talking about? You shouldn't test me. I'm serious! I only wanted to go on parole! What is this? This is an elevator for transporting cafeteria food. How many more seconds? Six… No, is it five? Jolyne! Two seconds left… F.F, the ball! Throw it to me! Dammit! What's your next move? Eight seconds left. Seven, six… F.F.! Will this do, Miraschon? Such an easy and simple request. Feel free to ask me again. The game of catch was just interrupted. It's game over, Jolyne Cujoh! Mary Lynn Manson will always collect what's owed! No matter where it is, even if you don't know where, Mary Lynn knows where it is. Jolyne! I'll take the most expensive organ. And for the remainder, your most prized possession, your father's disc. And the disc… was on her since the beginning! I won! Your organ, your disc… They're all mine now! The game of catch isn't over yet. But how? The ball… Impossible. -You broke the rules. -No. We never agreed on my partner. The guard is okay too, right? The debt collector agrees with me. How many throws do I have left? Is it ? Or ? It's a pain to count. Let's say , throws. We did it! MIRASCHON STAND: DEBT COLLECTOR MARY LYNN MANSON OUT OF COMMISSION I will return the disc to my father. Along with the other disc that Pale Snake has. No matter what.

This is Star Platinum! Jolyne Cujoh. Did she defeat the guard by herself and take the discs? I will return the disc to my father. Along with the disc held by Pale Snake… No matter what. Of course. All memories relating to myself have been deleted from Miraschon's disc. Therefore, no one will be able to track it to me. The difference between humans and animals, is that humans seek heaven. Humans ought to lead a life that leads them to heaven. This is what makes humans beautiful. EPISODE : OPERATION SAVAGE GUARDIAN (HEAD TO THE COURTYARD!), PART  -Soap. -Here's my rent. I want the most expensive watch you got. Move. I'm using the phone next. What? Are you crazy, bitch? I'll take real good care of-- Take a seat! You won't get tired! Here's a complimentary drink. Feel free to ask me again. This is The Speedwagon Foundation HQ in Dallas, Texas. We do not accept collect calls on this number. I looked up the number in a phonebook. I only have this number. And I'm an inmate at the Green Dolphin Street State Prison in Florida. My name is Jolyne Cujoh. Please connect me to someone who knows what this means. Please hold. Thank you for waiting. Are you Professor Jotaro Kujo's daughter? And you are? I am just a foundation representative. And I am not a Stand User. I see. But you seem to know about Stand abilities. Do you know about the discs? Yes, of course. After retrieving Dr. Jotaro Kujo's body from the UUV, he has been sheltered, not here in Dallas, but somewhere safe. I am so sorry to inform you of this, but your father is medically unresponsive. If I say that we can bring him back to life, will you believe me? I am merely a scientist. I cannot comment. I have obtained a disc. Just one of them. We can bring him back. I just know that the discs will bring him back. I'll do whatever it takes to deliver them to you. I just don't know how to do it. I want you to come up with a plan to deliver the discs there. Immediately. Isn't this conversation being recorded by the prison? Yes, probably. But that's a risk I'm willing to take. I have no time. This is urgent. I'm in a dangerous situation where I cannot hide the disc anywhere. There must be a way. And just so you know, I am not allowed visitors. I understand. Since you insist… What about the courtyard? The courtyard? Do you mean the courtyard between the men's and women's prisons? Yes. Please be there in  minutes. I can manage something. In  minutes? From now? Yes. You said this is urgent. If you instruct us to retrieve the discs, we will do everything we can to do so. If you say he will be revived, we believe you. However, we are a non-militaristic medical research foundation. We neither have the resources nor the ability to help you escape or save your life. Is that risk acceptable to you? Okay. I'll be there. And how will you retrieve the disc? We shouldn't speak of that over the phone. But please look for Savage Guardian. You will understand then. Let's call it Operation Savage Guardian for now. Savage Guardian… Is that an object? Or is it a person? Fine. I need to head to the courtyard. I'm at the cafeteria of the women's prison. To get to the courtyard, first, I must pass through the gate, go up the stairs in the back, cross the second floor corridor to get to the medical wing from the women's prison. You may pass. FE, you're the nuisance who got sent to the Punishment Ward. Your access to different parts of the facility is restricted. Jolyne. Emporio! Here! Do not touch the ball. We can't let others see us. Come with me. Wha… Emporio, those two… It's fine, they can be trusted. He prefers to sleep on a bed, but this room doesn't have one. So he ends up sleeping in the piano. Jolyne, I live in secret in this ghost of a room. Ghost of a room? Does that mean you're… No, Jolyne. He and I are alive. We aren't ghosts. You can touch us. We're warm and have pulses. Listen closely. Ghosts do not live here, but the building itself is a ghost. What? Does "the ghost of objects" make sense? This prison caught fire in  and went through a huge renovation. This room b*rned down in that fire. This room belongs in the past. It's a ghost of the music room. So… this means… Emporio, are you… Ever since I was born, I've been able to materialize the ghosts of objects. That's my Stand ability. But I can only use them. So even this chocolate bar and this orange juice… I can't consume them. But they still have a taste. They're quite good. What? Don't worry. This clock stopped when it b*rned along with the room. You still have time before your  minutes are up. But… you made a plan to deliver the disc over the phone. How reckless! I understand your situation. Pale Snake will learn about this. Please, Emporio. Tell me how I can reach the courtyard. Don't misunderstand me. I can't access just any place from this ghost room. I use the ghost items like this to get around without getting caught. I know you have no choice. He says he wants to tag along. You should take him. He can aid your cause. His name is Weather Forecast. This is a music room. Don't be so alarmed. Weather doesn't talk much because he has no memory. -Memory? -Yes. He has no memory of his childhood or when he arrived here. He's serving a six-year sentence. He has a habit of walking on tip-toes. He's a TV guide fanatic, but he doesn't watch TV. When he talks, he barely opens his mouth. And he talks right up to your face, so you may feel his lukewarm breath. He has no memory? Is that because Pale Snake stole them from him? Probably. He wants to learn about himself. He also wants to know why Pale Snake wants your father's discs. He says his Stand ability is not tied to the discs. He was born a Stand User. As for his ability… he can manipulate the weather to his will. His Stand name is… Weather Forecast. Pretend you didn't notice him. Someone was peeking to see where the music was coming from. Now it's confirmed. Someone knows you made a move and came to check on you. And we now know his face. STAND NAME: JUMPIN' JACK SPARK STAND MASTER: LANG RANGLER Dammit. He's already close. But if he's a Stand User, we need to take care of him now! No, Jolyne. We should hide for now. He doesn't know that you're headed for the courtyard. He didn't hear your phone call and that's why came to eavesdrop! If he knew, he would have waited at the courtyard. That's why, right now, he's chasing us! What's up with him? Turn into that corner before he gets any closer. Hurry! Just as I thought. He doesn't know where you're going yet. But what's with him? He had a weird way of running. We were able to hide because he's slow. Anyway, you need to head to the courtyard. Your phone call earlier was definitely recorded, but I don't think Pale Snake heard it yet. The sooner you go, the less dangerous it'll be. The medical wing is up ahead. Once you go downstairs and pass the medical wing, there's a gate for the corridor. It leads to the factory. It also leads to the men's prison across the courtyard. The medical wing is accessed by both men and women. Weather Forecast is a man, so if tells a guard he's going back to the men's prison, he'll have no problem getting to the connecting corridor and getting to the factory entrance. Go on ahead. I need to bribe the guards, right? Is  dollars enough? Tell them you want your boots repaired at the factory. But even if you manage to pass the medical wing, you'll have to get to the courtyard by force. The security is light, but if you get caught, they'll sh**t. and you'll get five more years for trying to escape. By force, huh? Guess I have to get used to using it. I just have to go. Another five years is nothing at this point. Thank you, Emporio. Right. This is the most I can do. Please revive him. If your father comes back to life, then I think I might be able see some hope. Oh, dammit. What's wrong with this cola? You touched the can, didn't you? Did you shake the can? Get me another one, will you? Oh, I didn't touch it. I only touched the plate. My shoe's got a hole on it. Over in the back. Can you see it? I wanted to get it repaired at the factory. Oh, man, my cola spilled. Where did I put that washrag? "Go get a cola"? You really want me to get one? And you want me to pour it into this cup? Do that yourself why don't you… What's going on? Oh, here's the washrag. You can go. But make sure to be back here in  minutes… Oh, she already left. What? Where's my cup and the plate? What's happening? Could it be… This is… The plate is floating! The cup and the boot as well. But, the contents of the cup aren't spilling out. It turns into balls of liquid and floats! Everything I touch is floating upwards! That money must have floated out of that guard's pocket! I'm in the air too. Since when that strange guy started chasing me...? He spit at me then. Did that cause this? The disc! Dammit. It slipped out when I rotated! Stone Ocean! My thread! I can't control it! There is no up and down. There's no gravity! I'm in zero gravity! You're going back to the men's prison? Okay. Go ahead. This is bad! He'll take my disc! If I try to punch, I'll lose my balance. I need to focus. Aim in a single direction like a rocket! What? Dammit. I can't destroy this disc. It just comes back like rubber. That's why Pale Snake told me to just collect it. Hold on! Weather Forecast, don't go any further! Can you hear me? I'm being att*cked! He took my disc. If we lose him now, everything is over. Everything will end! Don't let him go! No… My voice can't reach him. What a nuisance. Jolyne Cujoh, I thought I only needed to k*ll you. Jumpin' Jack Spark! Weather Forecast, his ability takes away gravity. Do not touch whatever it is he projects. You'll become weightless! Zero gravity. So you are a Stand User yourself. Surely, you understand the implications of my ability. He projected pieces of junk. Weather Forecast. This man, who is said to control the weather, is a mystery to me. But that cloud-like thing must be a layer of air. He used its resistance to deflect the enemy's att*ck. And he's using centrifugal force to spin his arm. It's weightless, it can accelerate forever with that spinning force. His body's center of gravity won't change, so he can accurately project a powerful att*ck. Jumpin' Jack Spark! Weather Forecast! This flame! Aerodynamic friction? Dammit, it's spreading! Zero gravity, deactivate! Meet your end! Corridor B. Emergency alarm activated. Dammit. That impact… And I have the disc, too! The gate is closing. What do I do? It's even harder to get to the courtyard now. But I have no choice. The enemy will be trapped too! This is my chance to get back the disc! What the hell?! Everything you touch… becomes weightless… Right? Jolyne Cujoh? The courtyard is just ahead. But where did he go? I need to get the disc back!
05x11 - Operation Savage Garden (Head to the Courtyard!) (2) / Operation Savage Guardian (Head to the Courtyard!) (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:21I have obtained a disc. Just one of them. We can bring him back. I just know that the discs will bring him back. Let's call it Operation Savage Guardian for now. You should take him. He can aid your cause. His name is Weather Forecast. Jumpin' Jack Spark! Weather Forecast! But where did he go? I need to get the disc back! EPISODE : OPERATION SAVAGE GUARDIAN (HEAD TO THE COURTYARD!) () Emergency alarm activated. Corridor B. -Yes, that's correct. Corridor B. -Emergency alarm activated. We are awaiting reports. Did something happen? We aren't sure as of yet. But Corridor B's sole function is for access to the factory. There is no possibility that it is a fire or a prisoner riot. Rest assured. Yes, indeed. I trust this prison and the prisoners. With all the commotion, curiosity got the better of me. Surely, you are aware that no prisoner has managed to escape from this prison for  years. Furthermore, the courtyard is outside of Corridor B. No prisoner would choose to escape from there, of all places. You're quite right. Leave the rest to us, Father. I'll be off then. Just one more thing out of curiosity… Is the clock on the wall accurate? Yes, of course. It is now : a.m. It's almost lunchtime. : a.m.  A call to The Speedwagon Foundation. I have the usual request. I'd like access to the collect call list and the recorded conversations. Women's prison, phone booth . The call from about seven minutes ago. Weather Forecast. Since you touched me, you are now weightless too. I don't see our enemy anywhere. We need to retrieve the disc right away. Stay calm. He must be within this laundry room. He is lurking somewhere. The courtyard is past that door. You are trying to reach that door, but it is most likely locked. You might need to blast it, or force it open somehow. There's... A slight problem... I know now's not the time for this… It's a personal thing… But it's urgent, and I need to go now. So, like… I don't know why it suddenly so suddenly. But, well… It's something that happens to everyone! What is this about? Well, it's the P-word related to the pelvic area. I'm just glad it's not "number two." You know, the biological phenomenon! You need to take a piss? No need to say it up close. I'm serious. I need to go. Just pick any corner. Dammit, why did I even try talking to a guy about this? I have relieved myself already. See? It's floating over there. In zero gravity, the blood in your body will suddenly collect in your head. Blood that is usually in the lower parts of the body due to gravity. The space between the skin and the bone is swollen and squishy with blood. It's called a "moon face." However, it's dangerous when too much blood goes to your head. The kidney automatically works harder to reduce the amount of blood. This triggers an acute diuretic effect. It attempts to thin the blood content by expelling salt. -But-- -Don't worry. I'll use my clouds to absorb your urine. What? Hey, wait, what are these droplets? They're leaking out of your cloud! Weather Forecast! No, that's not it. It's being sucked out through the gap in the wall! Me too. Blood from the wound I got earlier. My nose won't stop bleeding! I'm having difficulty breathing… No, it can't be! Jolyne! Everything I touch becomes zero gravity. I touched the walls leading to the door. That means the whole room is unaffected by gravity! The air! Air can't stay in zero gravity! It'll get pulled by the surrounding gravity, and it'll escape! We need to close up the gap! Otherwise, we'll suffocate to death! Jolyne, you're wrong. Suffocation isn't our primary concern. The blood in our bodies will boil first, leading to our death. In a vacuum, blood boils up like water. In a zero-gravity vacuum, people's blood will dry up in  seconds, before even suffocating. I'll reload my b*ll*ts. We'll get sh*t. We must hide somewhere! What are you saying? I'm bleeding out of my nose! We need to stop the air! Weather Forecast! Just take shallow breaths. I gathered what little air is remaining in this room, and covered our bodies with clouds. Cloud suits. The room is almost a complete vacuum. This is all the remaining air. Your nosebleed has stopped. How long can we keep breathing? I wish I didn't have to answer that. I'd say about two minutes. It's a cloud suit on the verge of death. If we don't defeat our enemy within that time, we'll be thrown into the vacuum, right? Precisely. Where is he? We must find him. Whether we act or not, his att*ck will finish us both. Hey, now that my nosebleed has stopped, I notice something. Listen, Jolyne. I said two minutes, but it could be one! We must find him immediately! Carbon dioxide is increasing as we speak! The laundry hampers. They aren't floating. The hampers over there. I touched the walls, shutters, and floor of this room. That's why the whole room entered zero gravity, and everything is floating. But why are those hampers and barrels not floating, and attached to the floor? Also, that enemy. How is he breathing in a vacuum? Shouldn't his blood be boiling over? In other words, that's the range of his ability. There is a distance range to this zero gravity. It's not the entire room! An att*ck range! From here to the hampers is about  meters or so. Zero gravity ends there. If we can get there, there will surely be normal air! You must go, Weather Forecast. He is outside of the vacuum range. If you do not control the air now, we will never reach our enemy. You may be correct. Outside that hamper… Go, Weather Forecast. The pressure in the suit is becoming strange. Go before this cloud suit disperses into the vacuum! Don't think you can get out of my att*ck range! He's gonna sh**t him down! I won't let you! I'll protect Weather Forecast! STAND NAME: WEATHER FORECAST STAND MASTER: WEATHER FORECAST He's coming around us! I'll charge ahead! He's going to reach air in a few meters. Once Weather Forecast gets air, he's going to corner you! If you want air that bad, you can have it. No need to even reach the hampers. I just now completed my att*ck. I wasn't trying to ricochet the b*ll*ts to injure him. I sh*t the barrel itself! A bit of air is left in the barrel. Highly pressurized air on the verge of expl*si*n, that is! Weather Forecast! He was pushed back to zero gravity. He is done for. He won't be able to gain enough force to stop the momentum. Weather Forecast! This is it. The suit itself is about to collapse! Jolyne! How reckless! You must go back! He'll sh**t you down! That thrust itself will dissipate your suit! She makes incredibly quick decisions. She charged into that bastard to stop his movement, and to push him outside of the zero gravity again! However, I won't let you through! I already know. Your Stand is very powerful. My rotating b*ll*ts aren't fast enough, and would get flicked away in defense. That's why I've been preparing. I've looked for them. I'd captured them away from view. There were quite a lot. Rats! They're alive! Could they be… Stone Ocean! Push them away! I can't see! Okay! I did not expect you to fight against my ability like this. This is checkmate. You're finished, Jolyne Cujoh! My mission is now complete! Jumpin' Jack Spark is the best. I feel invincible. I'm glad I was imprisoned here. With this ability I obtained here, there is nothing I can't do in this world. My future is rosy! I will hand this disc over to Pale Snake. I can defeat him too, if I wanted to. WIth my own hands! I knew it… I knew you'd do it. I was waiting for you to reload. I was waiting with my threads ready for you to reload your g*n. And you sh*t at me. These threads! When the hell did you do this?! Stone Ocean! What? You are the one in a complete vacuum. And now, without a suit, your blood will boil up and explode faster than us! We won! If you don't want to die, you must deactivate the zero gravity immediately! Dammit! The crime that put me in this prison… How many times did I s*ab her? When I k*lled the female professor, the prosecutor said I stabbed her  times. That compulsion. It's surging within me once more. sh*t. I won't let you underestimate me. That bitch! A reaction between hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide produces oxygen. Just like the oxygen in this bottle, it keeps coming out! My urge to slaughter someone like back then! Take this! I'll make a headstone out of your piss-soaked body with this glass! Jolyne Cujoh, your blood vessels will rupture first since you are covered in wounds! I got incarcerated for m*rder. I will k*ll you and leave this place an invincible man! Take this. This will be sufficient just to take the disc back from that bastard. Weather Forecast! What? Dammit! My body is at its limit! If I deactivate my ability, the air will rush in. I may be able to escape using the impact! Zero gravity, deactivate! Jumpin' Jack Spark! You should've deactivated it the first chance you had. The change in air pressure might have let you escape. If only you had deactivated it while you still had distance from Stone Ocean. The air is blowing you back toward me! How much longer until The Speedwagon Foundation arrives? Three minutes? Or two minutes? There is a corridor past this door. Alongside the right wall, there are windows that look out to the courtyard. There, you'll be able to see a revolving door's gate. This gate leads to the courtyard. The gate is accessible during the day and is unlocked. The next challenge is how to go about opening this door. I'll get a prison guard to open it. We have his work permit. We'll trick them into opening it. I see. Once the door opens, you'll knock the guards out and force your way to the courtyard. Very well. Not only will you be charged with attempted escape, but you'll also receive solitary confinement for six months where you cannot even exercise sufficiently. That's fine. I'll go to the courtyard and hand this disc over to someone from The Speedwagon Foundation. That's my only mission in life right now. The guards are coming. Weather Forecast, go find somewhere to hide. I'll go by myself from here. You're severely wounded, and if the guards see your injury, they might lock the gate. Very well. I understand. What is it? Why are you knocking? It's you. "It's you"? What is it, Rangler? What is this noise about? Hold still. I'll open the door. If you are returning to the men's prison, Lang Rangler, how about we stop by the chapel on the way? I'd like to speak to you. It's not a guard! Who is he? He's neither a guard nor a prisoner! What could his attire mean?

No, she would've already att*cked me if she knew I was her enemy. Wait! Please, Father! Please… Don't sound the alarm! I'm not here to cause any trouble! What should I do? It would be easy to b*at him unconscious. That's nothing compared to my father's life. Hitting him is nothing… There is already a problem. You unlocked the door using another inmate's work permit. Where is the owner of this permit, the inmate, Lang Rangler? I know I just met you, and I don't expect you to believe me. But I'm no liar, Father. That inmate att*cked me. It was self-defense. He's passed out in that basket over there. I must report this to the authorities. I understand, Father. But it has to be after I go to the courtyard. I only need two minutes… No, give me just a single minute, Father. I must go to the courtyard. That's all I ask. You want me to turn a blind eye? It's a matter of life and death. My father's life and soul depend on it. A man of God should understand. Are you here by yourself? Is there anyone else with you? No, I'm alone. I lied to a chaplain. But surely, a small lie can be forgiven. And I can't tell him about the disc. Please. I only need a minute. Doing something for others is all an act of expecting a reward. To be kind to others is to expect kindness from others. There is no such thing as unconditional love. Because unconditional love is a reward to go to heaven. You may go. I will pretend I didn't see you here. But only a minute as requested. You have to come back to this gate by then. I have no choice. Someone is hiding behind that container. If she has an ally with her, I can't reveal myself. I can't expose Pale Snake and k*ll Jolyne. The Speedwagon Foundation said I'll know how to hand over the DISC once I arrive once I go to the courtyard. You… Do you have a pass permit? Seems like you don't have one. You are charged with attempted escape. What?What just happened? I never intended to sound the alarm. I made the right move to have a prison guard watch the courtyard. EPISODE : TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR WARNING It was . I befriended a man from Egypt who claimed that he had the power to stop time. This man suddenly said to me… There may be a way to go to heaven. He was young and beautiful, and yet he had the countenance of a man who has lived for centuries. I was  at that time. A student advancing my studies. Hey, don't make a face. I'm not talking about death. The heaven I'm talking about pertains to our spirits. The place our spirits are headed. The power of our mind must surely evolve there. And ultimately where our spirits end up. Surely, you understand what I'm talking about more than anyone. True happiness lies there. Only if you can reach heaven. I know that happiness can't be obtained by having the mightiest body, the most money, or the highest status. True victory belongs to those who have seen heaven. I will do everything to reach that end. Can you be more specific? I've recorded it in a notebook. Come visit Egypt sometime. I will show you then. I will need your help to test my theory. However, before I learned of his methods… his notebook was b*rned to ashes. The one who b*rned it was Jolyne Cujoh's father, Jotaro Kujo. Jotaro read the contents of that notebook. And he sealed its contents forever along with Dio Brando who aimed for heaven. I laid in wait for over two decades to gain access to Jotaro Kujo's memory. The contents of the notebook are within his memory. And I finally obtained his memory along with Star Platinum, which surpassed Dio. And now, Jotaro's body will only decay. Though his daughter has acted quite unpredictably at this prison, my plan is back on schedule. She got sh*t! Jolyne got sh*t! Who? Was it a guard? Or did our enemy learn of our plan and Pale Snake is lurking nearby? Jolyne! The guard will retrieve Star Platinum. My business here is finished. I shall return to the chapel. What… What was this thing? It's a disc. That's right, I was ordered to retrieve this disc. He also ordered me to finish her off completely. But whose order was it? I don't remember… Anyway, I received an order to blow her brains out. It's over. There's nothing more I can do. I cannot help you… You're finished, Jolyne Cujoh! What the hell?! My ability, Weather Forecast, manipulates the weather. This is all I can do. Jolyne, I may not be able to save you, but I can still protect the disc. And if you still have the conviction, you too may be able to make it out. Between  and , in Florida alone, it was reported that more than  cases of fish, frogs, snakes and sheep fell from the sky. The cause is attributed to tornadoes and whirlwinds. And these are poison dart frogs, which live atop the trees of Central and South America. It carries subcutaneous poison so deadly, even aboriginals used them for blowguns. What the hell are these frogs?! These are… These frogs. Aren't they poison dart frogs, known for their toxicity? Once their poison enters the body, it takes mere seconds for the heart and respiratory system to shut down. That's what's splattering along with their body fluid right now. Pale Snake! This ability… Could it be his, who manipulates the weather? Weather Forecast. He should have lost his memory. Was he the one hiding behind the barrel? This is bad! Card key! These frogs are poisonous. What happened to me? Did I get sh*t? Are the wounds deep? The poison, it's seeping through the threads! Someone, open the gate! Please! Calm down. I must keep my composure. What do I do in such a situation? Two, three, five. Calm down. Seven. Count prime numbers and calm down. Prime numbers are solitary numbers that can only be divided by  and itself. They give me strength. Twenty-three. Twenty-eight. No, . Dammit. The frogs are covering my  dollar pants! Weather Forecast is in the laundry room. He's too far. I cannot stop this downpour of frogs. I must escape. Forty-one. That's right. The guard in the courtyard. He's still under my command by the disc. What happened to him? Guard, do you hear me? I order you to come here! Father! Help me! Ask God to save me, please! Forty-three. Forty-seven. Fifty-three. Fifty-nine. What a potent poison. -Tell God to save me! -So you do hear me. Give me your card key! Will I make it out? Hey! Don't take it out right now, idiot! Father! Sixty-seven. Seventy-one. What is going on here? These frogs… I'm saved! Open the gate immediately! Father? What's going on? I don't know! A tornado, most likely. Anyway, hurry it up! Understood. I'll open it now. These frogs, they're… What are you doing? There's an unconscious guard on this side. Hurry, open the door! An unconscious guard? Hold on, Father. I'll get help right away! Wait! Where are you going? Just open this door! That's it! I understand, but what if I need permission? Let me ask my superior. Stay calm. Calm down, Father! I am very calm. The one who's not calm… Seventy-three. Seventy-nine. …is you! You dare abandon me? I'll be back soon, Father! Pale Snake! Give me a disc! I may not be able to control all of them, but I can control one frog. Explode after jumping ten meters. I order you! My eyes! Save me. Father, call for help, please! Father, please! Eighty-three. Eighty-nine. Ninety-seven. I'm right here. You believe that if I leave here and call for help, you could get treated right away. That is what you're thinking, right? Then come towards my voice. Father! Jotaro Kujo's disc, Star Platinum. What should I do with it? I have eliminated Jolyne Cujoh, but I cannot leave her there. Did the gate open? Take me with you… Father? Where are you, Father?! I'm at the end of my rope. I can't guard against the the poison! The disc that I let go… I don't know where it is anymore! The rain stopped. Where is Jolyne Cujoh's corpse? The disc must be close by. That was vexing, but my Snake would never lose to frogs. Search for it. Pale Snake's range is  meters at most. It would pose a serious problem if anyone spots me here, but I'm out of options. The soul of a dead criminal returns to the earth in the form of a frog in want of companions to the afterlife. I've heard of such a legend existing in the East. Doesn't it describe this hellish scene perfectly? And the disc must be somewhere around here. Pale Snake. Search towards the gate from there. The guard might have taken it. It must be within that direction. I found it! I've recovered the disc. Thanks. I was waiting for you to find it. Goddammit. It's grossing me out. They're stuck on my face. Yuck. The frogs splatter poison when they hit the ground and burst. If they aren't crushed, they are harmless. I made a net with the living frogs to lessen the impact of falling frogs. And I waited for you to find the disc. What a futile attempt! I'll k*ll you, you piece of sh*t! He was already here. The envoy from The Speedwagon Foundation, that is. He wasn't even human, and he came exactly on time. He weaved past the rain of frogs and reached this courtyard. Savage Guardian is the name of a pigeon. The trained homing pigeon will carry the disc to the right place. Pale Snake! The g*n the guard dropped is by the gate! sh**t the pigeon down! That damn guard! He used up all the b*ll*ts! Dammit! I won. Don't underestimate me! Nothing has changed. Even with Star Platinum, your father is still a living mummy! He won't even recall his own daughter! Look! A guard is down! Don't step on the frogs! Search the courtyard! Someone might be there! Don't blank out yet. Its Stand User must be close by. I must find Pale Snake's Stand User first. The User has my father's memory disc. Now's my chance to find its User! Hey! Look out the window! Oh my god! It's a miracle! It has to be! But who's going to clean this up? The tide hasn't changed. I took Jotaro's Star Platinum only out of my pledge to avenge Dio, my friend. The memory disc is the one that matters, and it's in my hands. Everything is according to plan. Only Jotaro's memory contains clues to attain heaven. An abnormal situation where the frogs rain only in the prison courtyard. Jolyne's escape attempt was unquestioned in this chaos. And The Speedwagon Foundation obtained Jotaro Kujo's Star Platinum disc. But Jotaro's soul won't return without the Memory disc. Sports Maximum. I wanted to ask you about this bone. I want you to try something using your ability. Is that a human bone? Whose is it? That doesn't concern you. Let's just say it belongs to an old friend of mine. My dear friend, Dio's bone.
05x13 - Kiss of Love and Revenge (1) / Smack of Love and Revenge (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:23GREEN DOLPHIN STREET STATE PRISON Stop right there! What's going on here? What are you doing? ULTRA SECURITY HOUSE UNIT Prisoner FE. Name, Jolyne Cujoh. This is the second time you've caused us trouble. First, you attempted a jailbreak. And now, at the prison mausoleum, a female inmate has been found dead from blunt force head trauma. And yet, you refuse to talk and continue to act defiantly. For some reason, v*olence and death follow you wherever you go. We have no proof that you're the culprit, but you are, without a doubt, the troublesome type. Therefore, from now on, you will be disciplined according to protocol. You are hereby confined for an indefinite amount of time in this Ultra Security House Unit. f*ck! -f*ck! -There's a woman! The newcomer's a woman! I smell a woman! Her smell is seeping out under the door! What the hell? Yes! I got sh*t on her face! My own sh*t, on a woman's face! I want to bash her up too! One thing that must not happen here is the exhaustion of my mental strength. The unnecessary stress and the physical toll it takes. There is something I must accomplish in this Ultra Security House Unit! I must succeed, no matter what. And for that, I must not waste any energy. No. I will grow even stronger! It may be possible to attain heaven.  YEARS AGO Hey, don't look so glum. I'm not talking about death. The heaven I'm talking about has to do with the soul. The place our soul travels to. The power of our soul must surely evolve there. I'm talking about the final form of our souls. Surely, you, out of anyone else are able to comprehend. True happiness lies there. But this is contingent upon attaining heaven. I know happiness is not attained by obtaining the mightiest body, having lots of money, or having dominion over others. True victory belongs to those who have seen heaven. I will do everything… …to reach that end. Let's say I place this sticker on this pen. EPISODE : SMACK OF LOVE AND REVENGE () It then creates a copy of the pen. This is my ability. I call it Smack. Peel the sticker off, and… the pen fuses back together with force, leaving a fissure. It is now easier to destroy. I take this ability as my sign from God. He'll remember in no time that this seal of kiss is my license for revenge. Good morning, Father. May I have one of these flowers? I've grown a fondness for them recently. Of course, feel free to take it. Sports Maximum. F.F., she's cutting in front of you. Hey, I said she cut in line. I know. For some reason, I feel like the others don't accept me here. It's like they're looking down on me. Don't cut, dumbass! Tell her off. I disagree with you. It's not good to force something. You have to change yourself before seeking approval from others. Isn't that right? So, I decided to do the exact opposite of what I usually do. What's the opposite of coffee? Tea? That's right. Atroe's body, which I took over, is craving coffee. So I go with tea instead. On purpose. Does that make sense? Instead of bread, I eat rice. Use my non-dominant left hand instead of my right hand to eat. I'm trying to change myself by doing the exact opposite. Listen, F.F. The wound where I got sh*t… It hurts like hell. I told you. I can only fill the holes with plankton. The rest is up to your body's ability to heal. -Got that? -Damn. Jolyne, what's the opposite of pork? Maybe chicken, or even beef. The opposite of pork is salmon. Pigs lie around in mud all day. Salmons swim against the current to go upstream. I love that. They're cutting again. Scram, bitch! Come on, tell them off! Like I said, I'm trying the exact opposite. Like dragging people into the line. Come along now, right here. What's the matter with you? I won't let you cut in front of me. Don't touch me, bitch. Go to the back, dumbass! What did you call me, bitch? -The hell? -Look at that. It's so much easier to grab food now. Easy as pie. By the way, where's Ermes? I haven't seen her for a few days. Haven't you heard? She's following a man? Is Ermes really doing that? Yeah. Every morning for a while now. Even when you got sh*t, Jolyne. I haven't seen Jolyne. Something's going on in the courtyard. Looks bad. Hey, Ermes! Leave her be. The inmate Ermes is tailing? Yes. You know all the rumors around here. That's correct. I'm honored you came to me, Jolyne. Oh, you don't expect me to tell you for free, right? An information fee. I'll give you a friend's discount. Found it. "The body of a female thought to have been caught in the crossfire of g*ng v*olence was found by the river before dawn." Florida's local papers. It's dated six years ago. It's exactly as Gwess said. Gloria Costello. So she is Ermes's older sister. THE NEXT DAY Over the last few days, I've waited for the right time  as I watched you, carefully and closely. I don't know what caused you to change your heart, but I watched you sweeping the old prison's graveyard. You also left flowers at a grave. Were they for your fellow g*ng members who were ex*cuted in the electric chair? I also watched you making taxidermy birds and alligators in the prison's workshop. Now, why would a grunt like you take up a sudden interest in such a hobby? Well, none of that matters. But there's one thing I must know. Jolyne, F.F. You seem well, Ermes. Here you go. Your share of breakfast. Ermes, about that man you are following… Following? I don't know what you mean. Don't play stupid. His name is Sports Maximum. He is a notorious gangster in the outside world. But now, he is incarcerated in the male wing here. Is that so? Not that it concerns me. Ermes. You were sent here at Green Dolphin for armed robbery. Did you do that just to become a convict at this facility? For you to exact revenge on Sports Maximum for your sister's death. Jolyne. You don't pry into other people's business in prison. Really? Well, I'm doing opposites today. I don't need you to butt in. Go back to the female wing. Ermes is right, Jolyne. You have your own mission to worry about. I know. Just a little longer, Gloria. I'll avenge you with my own hands. Ermes. Think of me as your mother from now on. From that day on, Gloria… you always put the family first. Ermes. You can help at the store sometimes, you know. I want you to inherit your father's restaurant with me. The hell should I care. I'm getting out of here. I want to get a cross-country scholarship and go to college. Don't act all high and mighty and tell me what to do. Ermes! Don't leave! Help me… Fetch me that thick stick with your mouth. Not like a dog, but as a baby would do it. I'm not interested in seeing what lies in the dark. I wouldn't report it to the authorities either. The darkness will handle those who live by it. That's the only way to keep a restaurant open in that city. But that night… Gloria had no choice but to put herself in danger and call the police. She did it to protect me. But even then… Defendant Sports Maximum, you are hereby sentenced to five years in prison for tax evasion and as*ault. Five years? Only five years? We can't corner him with a weak witness. This is the best we can do. He had her k*lled! He destroyed all evidence of that. Bullshit. -Wait. Wait, dammit! -Stay put! f*cking bastard! So you do remember her. That's right. You must not forget Gloria. Gloria! I've been waiting for this chance. I've been waiting for you to be alone so no one can hear your screams. That's what I've been wanting to know. The things you made Gloria suffer through. Sports Maximum. I'll make you remember them! STAND NAME: SMACK STAND MASTER: ERMES COSTELLO The hell is this? What are you doing to me, bitch? Your sentence ends in about a year. Once you're free, you'll have bodyguards. But you are defenseless in here! Yes. It's a perfect fit for you. It's true that prison pipes are not big enough to fit a human being. But that means it fits you perfectly as a coffin. Is that the sound of you falling down? Hey, help me out. Who the hell are you? Let me out, now! -You still don't understand who I am? -What? Take the last few moments of your life to think it through. You left Gloria's body in the gutter. And her suffering drove my father ill. I… lost everything. Beg them for forgiveness in hell, Sports Maximum! If you can with that mouth full of wastewater, that is! I placed a second sticker on the pipe. It'll be a lid for this coffin. It's completely closed now. Now, scream all you want. -You bitch! -Go on, call for help. Only cockroaches and rats will hear you. You belong in the gutter, bastard. Now try to scream, Sports Maximum! Those who rise from the darkness, Limp Viscuit… Come forth and join me… We will share joy in the darkness, Limp Viscuit… Something's there. It's coming towards me. This att*ck! It can't be! Sports Maximum can't be… f*ck, my finger. He's using a Stand ability. I don't understand why I can't see it, but I definitely felt its form. It was bird-shaped! Sticker… Did I win? Did I crush it? I couldn't have known that he gained a Stand ability. How's that? Sports Maximum, you've gone quiet. Did you get crushed inside that pipe? Or did the filthy water fill you up from your mouth to your assh*le, drowning you to death? What is it now? Is Sports Maximum still alive? He must still be alive in that pipe, hence this strange unseen power. It's bigger than the last one. It's fast! This power… Could it be the stuffed alligator from the workshop? Earlier, that was… the bird's corpse moving around. The invisible corpses have gained the power to move. They're the ones attacking me! That bastard. He's trying to bust the pipe and break free! Ermes. Why are you up there? Ermes. Jolyne is worried about you-- Jolyne, F.F, don't come any closer! -F.F! -There's an enemy. There's an alligator. Invisible, dead beasts are crawling around! Damn, it got my leg. Ermes, just what is happening here? -Is this a Stand att*ck? -That's right. It's that bastard, Sports Maximum. He gained a Stand ability without me knowing… Run! It's charging towards you! It's already on the move! Stone Ocean!
05x14 - Kiss of Love and Revenge (2) / Smack of Love and Revenge (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:24It may be possible to attain heaven. Can you be more specific? I've recorded it in a notebook. However, before I learned of his methods… I laid in wait for over two decades to gain access to Jotaro Kujo's memory. The contents of the notebook are within his memory. The m*rder*r had planned to steal my father's Stand by giving it form. That's his ability. My dad's not dead. If I get his Stand back, he will come back to life. I won. Don't underestimate me, bitch! Nothing has changed. Even with Star Platinum, your father is still a living mummy! The User has my father's memory disc. Now's my chance to find its User! There's something I want you to try doing to it. Is that a human bone? Whose is it? It doesn't concern you. Let's just say that it belongs to an old friend of mine. My dear friend, Dio's bone. EPISODE : SMACK OF LOVE AND REVENGE () Damn, it got my leg. Ermes, just what is happening here? -Is this a Stand att*ck? -That's right. Run! It's charging towards you! It's already on the move! Stone Ocean! Jolyne! So this is a Stand ability. He must have gotten a disc from Pale Snake. This must mean… I see now. Jolyne, take F.F. and get out of here. This is my problem. You stay out of it. No, Ermes. This isn't just your problem anymore. Sports Maximum must be after something. Most likely, it's related to my father's stolen memory. He is trying to find something within these prison walls. And we can learn what he's plotting by reading the disc inside Sports Maximum's head. Jolyne, focus on escaping this corridor for now. He has got to be close to drowning in that pipe. If we can hold out until then, his ability will disappear. -Something's off. -What? Where is it? The invisible stuffed alligator. If it moves, the threads should vibrate and show me its location. It's on the wall! The hell? sh*t, an invisible corpse has no concept of up and down. It can travel on the floor or the walls! Stop! I'm the one you want, bastard! You're wrong, Ermes. He's no longer just an enemy of you two. This bastard bit off my left leg. Where is my leg now? In its stomach? So this assh*le is my enemy too. Stay back, F.F. We don't know where it is. It'll take a bite out of you! Stop, F.F. You're right. It'll bite me. That's all these corpses can do. But it's fine. I got my hand inside its mouth. We did it. I felt it going down. Isn't this a part of your mauled shoulder? Dammit, it may not be big enough to patch up. He chomped your shoulder to pieces. Here, F.F. Oh, thanks. -Ermes, come closer. -Yeah? Ermes, am I correct that we were att*cked by an alligator-like ghost? Sports Maximum controls these ghosts. No, I don't think that's right. It was way too vicious. It wasn't a ghost, but an invisible corpse. What? A living dead that hunts for blood by instinct. Sports Maximum's ability can create invisible zombies. The pipe! What is it now, Ermes? What happened to Sports Maximum? Did he drown to death? I can't tell. It's too dark for me to see. He may be lodged deeper in the pipe. Or, maybe he… These handprints… f*ck… My throat is coated with shitty water. I want to rinse my mouth, dammit. What was I about to do? Where was I trying to go? Oh, I remember it now. The chapel… I'm headed to the chapel. My mission… is to find that piece of bone. If you fail, surely you understand that the ability I bestowed will no longer be yours. I know it. My ability, Limp Viscuit, can find that bone. The bone Pale Snake ordered me to find. I can find it. Dammit. I sure could use a break before I start. Like a good scrubbing and something to drink. Something refreshing. That woman there… Perfect timing. She's a bitch type… What was her name? I can't recall it. I'll just call her a bitch. Damn. Won't even greet me though I'm bribing him. Hey, how's it going? Are you on duty? I could use a drink. You want to go to the cafe with me? Afterward, we can have a little fun in a corner in some room. We can rub each other's bodies all over. assh*le, how dare you touch me? You touched me. You better pay up first! What are you talking about? Little sh*t. How dare he touch you when he hasn't even paid? What the… Dammit. Where did Sports Maximum go off to? He must have escaped that pipe while we were dealing with the alligator. Or… Maybe he has already turned into an invisible corpse. That was just a little kick. Stop fooling around! Fooling around? He looks down on you once and it's over for you, bitch. Do whatever it takes to make him pay up. Lend me a hand, and let's find his cash. Are you listening? Come on, help me. He's got something on his sleeves. What's this? Oh, so you will pay me? Why didn't you say that first? That's what I just said. Listen closely, idiot. What else can he be hiding? What about here inside his mouth? Hold on, you want to do it right now, right here? I don't get it. What is it that you want to do? Come on, stop fooling around. I don't do that kinky stuff. I'll be taking this. You had something nice, after all. What the hell is this? This isn't a drug. It's seeping out of my skin. This smell… It's sewage! It's the stench of sewage! My body… The filthy water seeping out of my body reeks of… f*ck! No, I can't already be… The hell? It's flowing from midair. The f*ck's going on? I didn't want anything to drink in the first place. I wanted to devour something! I wanted to devour and satisfy this craving! Yes, the brains! I remember it now. I drowned to death in that pipe. sh*t! She did this to me! That younger sister of Gloria Costello! That bitch, how dare she do this to me? How dare she! I thirst! Ermes, look over there. Oh, my. Be careful. He's out of the pipe just as I thought. How did he do this to her? Did he bite her to death? Are human teeth capable of such a vicious att*ck? Can they destroy a human body like this? He's no longer human, neither in intelligence nor morals. But Pale Snake's disc is with this man, without a doubt. I'll do whatever it takes to get that disc. Jolyne, you wait outside. Damn, he slipped out. Don't leave my side, Ermes. We're trapped in! He is capable of thinking just like a human! Stay away from the wall! We already know that he's not confined to the floor! We'll track his location three-dimensionally! There you are! You chose to hang from the ceiling. Sounds like I crushed some bones. Grabbing with his broken wrist? Right, he's already a corpse. Stone Ocean! He's caught! No. Jolyne! That's not Sports Maximum! He's using the dead woman's body as a decoy! Jolyne! STAND NAME: LIMP VISCUIT STAND MASTER: SPORTS MAXIMUM Jolyne! Where? Where the hell are you, fucker? Jolyne. Don't move anymore, Jolyne. He's not your enemy. This is between me and Sports Maximum. Like I said, Ermes. This goes beyond your personal desire for revenge. No, not even beyond. We are already out of time and energy to even plan. Look over there. -He can't be… -He's had us… cornered the entire time. He has already revived them. The invisible undead. Who knows how many are lurking and where. We're surrounded, Ermes. Let's turn back for now. Staying alive is our priority. We must open that door so that we can escape. I'll extend the thread as much as possible to get F.F. We'll retreat for now. Retrieving the disc and getting your revenge can wait. Ermes! Revenge… That's what's important here, Jolyne. Revenge matters most even to Sports Maximum, who is lurking somewhere in this room. He wants to get revenge for being drowned to death. He must be overcome by vengeance right now. He wants to maul me to death and fill his mouth with blood. -What are you-- -Sports Maximum will make sure -that he's the one who kills me. -Ermes. Listen, Jolyne. Some people will say getting even won't bring my sister back. As if they know what I went through. And others tell me forgiveness is important. Gloria! Bullshit. Forcing myself to forget how it feels to have family thrown in the gutter and live on? I refuse to live like that, and I've braced myself for this moment. Revenge is the way to settle the score with my fate. No, Ermes. Fighting him to the death? Stop. Step back, Ermes. I'm reaching F.F. at this very moment. Five, no, seven of the undead are severing my threads and closing in on us! Don't do this, Ermes! Ermes! Which direction would he strike from? My… consciousness… Ermes… She copied her head with her sticker! The seal of kiss… is my license for revenge! I found you, Sports Maximum! I knew you'd try as much. Just like when you trapped me in that pipe, I knew you'd use that sticker to copy an object. Your ability won't work against me anymore. After all, I am… already dead. sh*t, it didn't work. Where the hell is he? You can't hear my voice, can you? But I'll say it anyway. It's your sister's fault for witnessing what she shouldn't have. Er… mes… Damn! Missed again! Because of your sister, I fell into your hands, and look at me now. I will never get over this feeling. Not this one. Nor this one. Listen up. Even if I eat your brains and stuff the sh*t in your guts into your emptied skull, I will never get over what you did to me. It's over! Now, I will finish you off! Ermes was waiting for this exact moment! The moment he removes the sticker so he can maul her head! Remove the sticker, and the copy fuses back to the original. Even if Sports Maximum had swallowed the duplicate earlier! I know exactly where you are now! Aim slightly above. The midsagittal plane of your face! She got him! Listen. This kick is for Gloria. Sounds like the bones on your face broke just now. Think of it as Gloria smashing your face. And this… is also for Gloria! Make mincemeat out of this bitch! You plan on hiding again. Well, you won't be able to. A sticker split your head in two. Remove this sticker, and it returns to the original. The next hit is also for Gloria. And the one after that too. And so is the next one! The next one too. They are all for Gloria! This one, and this one too! Take this! And this! This, this, and this! This, this, this, and this! They're all for Gloria! I don't know why, but tears started rolling down. I just want… to cry next to you. But I may not have that kind of time. F.F.! Where are you? Come heal her! Hurry! Open this door. Hurry! SPORTS MAXIMUM STAND NAME: LIMP VISCUIT - ANNIHILATED Emergency alarm, Commons Area A, Mausoleum. Stop right there! What's going on here? Don't move! Prisoner FE. Name, Jolyne Cujoh! After reading that disc, I now understand. I know what I must do in here now.
05x15 - Ultra Security House UnitQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:26Listen closely now, Sports Maximum. Just as land comprises % of the planet and water comprises %, a certain number of souls are able to inhabit this planet. The more that humans populate this earth, proportionately, fewer of the other organisms can inhabit it. The total number of souls constantly remains fixed. Now, let's suppose that there's a way for one human to possess dozens, no, hundreds of thousands of souls. What will this human see? What does the future hold for such a human? I couldn't even begin to guess. It's an interesting thought, though. So, what is it that you want me to do? Sports Maximum. I wanted to ask you about this bone. There's something I want you to try doing to it. Try to revive this bone. Is that a human bone? Whose is it? That doesn't concern you. Let's just say it belongs to an old friend of mine. You're telling me to revive it, but that's just a tiny piece. Or do you mean to tell me that the entire skeleton is somewhere else? Can a single bone even be revived? Dio… This is his last remaining bone. The rest of him is dust. They no longer exist in this world. But you must try, Sports Maximum. If you fail, surely you understand that the ability I bestowed will no longer be yours. I get that. But I already tried. It's done already. What's happening? Where is the bone? Where did it go? Where is Dio's bone? What did you do to it? Where is his bone? Now tell me! The hell should I know? That's not a normal bone, now, is it? That bone is beyond my ability's control. The bone is moving around by itself. But I can sense it. I sense it moving around close by. Search for it! Get going, now! Hold it, Sports Maximum. This proves his theory. There definitely is a way to get to heaven. Do not chase the bone. Leave it be. Let his bone wander about freely. I shall merely observe its movements. Then, I will combine it with Jotaro Kujo's memory. I will learn the truth! I feel the bone's presence from the Ultra Security House Unit. Someone may have picked it up. That was Sports Maximum's memory Ermes retrieved by coincidence. Of course, Jolyne already watched it. Then Jolyne got punished on purpose so that she gets confined at the Disciplinary Wing to find the bone! Yes. But it's too reckless. Pale Snake must be aware that we read Sports Maximum's memory. Now, he will do everything within his power to eliminate Jolyne. Jolyne will not last in that wing by herself. I am able to exist like this thanks to Jolyne. But I don't know what I can do. I want your help. I can't. Even Weather Forecast, who is recuperating in the infirmary, cannot reach that part of the facility. I wish I could help, but… The Maximum Security Disciplinary Wing, or Ultra Security House Unit, is southeast of the male wing. To reach it, you must first leave the premises on a transport car. There are no secret passages there either. I've never even been there. So I don't know how I can keep Jolyne safe. I'm not asking you to keep her safe. I only want you to sneak me inside the Ultra Security House Unit. Hey, is there anything you can do for us? You can't expect him to help. Anastasia wouldn't cooperate. But isn't he a Stand User? Were you born with your ability? Like I said, don't count on Anastasia. He will not cooperate with anyone, no matter the reason. Why is that? It's because… I'm willing to do anything. If you take me to the Ultra Security House Unit, -I'll do anything to repay you-- -Stop, F.F. He just isn't the type of person who helps others out. What I'm trying to say is, well… Have you heard of Anastasia, his name? He's a m*rder*r. Anastasia's full name is Narciso Anastasia. Ever since he was a child, for some inexplicable reason, he's had a peculiar habit. No, not really a habit, but rather, a syndrome. A syndrome where he has the urge to disassemble everything. He just must disassemble what he sees. When he was ten, he disassembled his neighbor's Porsche and was institutionalized for six months. One time, he disassembled a high-voltage telephone pole. And when he was , he went over to his then girlfriend's apartment. She was in bed with another man. Anastasia disassembled their bodies on the spot so they can never be together again. The psychiatric analysis conducted after his arrest surprisingly came back normal. That's how he ended up in the Aquarium. Without Weather Forecast keeping him under control, who knows what he's capable of? That's Anastasia. So please, give up on him. But I can't reach Jolyne by myself. I need backup. At the least, I can't do it without his help. But how strange. This feeling… If he refuses,  I'll try to coerce him into it with my ability. But… I can't visualize my first sh*t successfully hitting him. I don't even know where to aim for. If I'm not willing to k*ll him, he won't listen to me. That's the feeling I get from him, but still, I must try. That's the reason why I came. All right. Okay. I can go defend her. Jolyne Cujoh, that is. -What? -I will cooperate. And if she wants to find that bone or something, I will help with that too. Now, let's hurry. She may be under att*ck as we speak. Hold on, Anastasia! What are you plotting? Plotting? I just told you. I will protect her with all my might. But… I've taken a liking to her, and everything about her the moment I laid my eyes on her. She willingly went to the Disciplinary Wing to save her father. Her conviction charms me even more. If I successfully protect her to the end, then I will marry her. This is my condition. Got that? F.F., was it? You said you are willing to do anything. Then, give us your blessing. That's what a wedding needs. What the… Do what now? He said he'll do what with Jolyne just now? Diver Drive! The hell's going on? What was that crash? The att*ck was delayed, and it came out of the wall. That's Anastasia's Stand, Diver Drive's ability. Give us your blessing. STAND NAME: SURVIVOR STAND MASTER: GUCCIO Hey, out of curiosity, Dio. Out of all the Stands you've seen, which one was the weakest? It can be one you encountered while traveling around the world, or one that was created. Which one, I wonder. What is considered suitable is different from person to person. A king has his strengths… and a cook has his own too. That's what it means to live. The same goes for Stands. The concept of being strong or weak does not apply. I phrased it badly. Children argue for fun about things like "Which one is stronger, Stallone and Van Damme?" Let's talk on that level. A Stand I named Survivor is the weakest. However, Survivor is a handful. Survivor? Sounds powerful. It was . In France's Lorraine region, a group of six went hiking, went missing, and then were found dead. The investigation team stated that the six broke out into a fight in the mountains. They fought each other to death. Men and women alike applied such intense force to their muscles that their own bones broke. A tooth that broke and flew off after a punch had split a rock and wedged itself there. That's how brutal the struggle was. Even the victor was unable to descend the mountain due to his injuries. Here is what I learned later. The six had stayed in a lodge the night before they d*ed. They had quarreled with the lodge owner. One of the women ridiculed the lodge owner's body odor, saying he stunk. And this lodge owner was a Stand User. Precisely. But what did this lodge owner do to them? And why did the six fight to their deaths? The answer is that he did nothing. He did nothing to them, but there was a slight anger that surged in his mind. And that slight anger converted into a small electric potential in his brain, traveled down his nervous system, and flowed out into the ground. That's the Stand, Survivor. The electric current followed the ground's surface all the way to the six hikers. The ground and the hikers' shoes had to be wet to let the electricity travel easily. The electric potential sending signals to the nervous system is very small, at mV. This Stand dwells in that slight pulse of energy. Survivor's att*ck is mostly unnoticed, and it doesn't cause any harm. It does not injure humans, nor can it manipulate them. It cannot inflict pain or put someone to sleep. The Stand does none of these things. It simply awakens its victim's anger. It stimulates the limbic system of the human brain ever so slightly, awakening its fighting spirit. Just because one woman ridiculed the lodge owner's body odor, all six were made to fight to their deaths. Earlier, you said it's a handful. A useless Stand is what it is. It can't tell a friend from foe. If subordinates started fighting each other, their organization would collapse. Could you give me that ability? If you don't plan on using it, I'll take just the Stand. Extract the ability only and store it in a disc, you say? That may be a good idea. To each their own. It may prove useful one of these days. I guess these mushrooms are edible. They're pretty good. It's shower time. Get up, FE! It's bright! Hell yeah! I got her! She hid! She hid like a dirty cockroach! I win this cell. The total sum is  dollars for my wins! Sorry! Damn. But all I got on me is  dollars. Come on, let's shake on it. If that's all you got, I guess. In any case, what I must do here is to use this thread to find the bone. What is that bone doing here? I don't know the answer yet, but for some reason, it's somewhere inside this Disciplinary Wing. Could it be in someone's possession? If I can obtain the bone first, Pale Snake will come after me. And with him, my father's stolen memory disc in his hand! Hey dumbass! Who told you to stand? By the way, how do you think the Marlins will play tonight? Their chances of winning are slim. The pitcher broke up with that reporter girl. He won't throw any strikes. You want to bet those  dollars on it? I'm in. Aren't you short on money, though? I'm telling you, his throws will be bad. No, that pitcher is good. You're such easy prey. Can't wait for tonight's game. Oh, sorry. This valve doesn't close very easily. Be more careful. I have to go back to the main prison to change. Hey, why did you hit me? I said I'm sorry. It's not like I got you wet on purpose. Oh, did I hit you just now? The hell is wrong with you? I didn't smack you that hard. You want some? You didn't need to punch me hard, bastard. -You jerk! -assh*le! Why you little… All right, that's enough. I said enough. I said stop. I'll apologize. I'm sorry. I'll lend you my uniform if you don't have a spare. That settles it, right? Let's be done. What got into you? Calm down. Are you in a bad mood today? We're friends… right? That hurts! You swing hard, fucker! I'll take you on! What has gotten into them? It can't be… I'm getting excited. His physique… I can see where his body's strengths are! His superbly developed muscles! Beautiful… I can sense his strongest muscle structures! How wonderful it is to fight! What the… What's happening to their bodies? What are those things that seem to shine? Here I come. I'll show you who is stronger! I am the strongest! Is this an enemy's att*ck? Is that guard my foe? No, the enemy hasn't shown up yet. But this is a Stand ability! This freakish feel… It must be a Stand att*ck! "Do not cast what is holy to the dogs; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces." Matthew :. Sports Maximum has gone missing. I can't fathom how they learned of it, but I must conclude that they read his memory. The number of Stand Users I sent to the Disciplinary Wing… Four! If Jolyne Cujoh entered the Disciplinary Wing in search of Dio's bone… I cannot let her live a moment longer. I will use all my strength to eliminate her! It doesn't really matter what happens inside the Disciplinary Wing. Those four will undoubtedly fight on until Jotaro's daughter is eliminated! He sent everything he's got. I can see where your strengths are! Bastards! I can see the strongest parts of each fighter's body from here! It's Fight Club time! Let's brawl!

Survivor's att*ck is mostly unnoticed, and it doesn't cause any harm. It simply awakens its victim's anger. EPISODE : THE SECRET OF GUARD WESTWOOD Bastards! I can see the strongest parts of each fighter's body from here! It's Fight Club time! Let's brawl! I've always found you irritating, f*ckers! The enemy User must be among them. One of them manipulated the guards into fighting. The bone lurking somewhere within this Ultra Security House Unit… I'll do anything it takes to make it mine! I won't let anyone stand in my way. If anyone dares, I will k*ll-- Hold on… k*ll? Did I really think that just now? This burning feeling awakening within me… Is this my fighting spirit? It urges me to conquer all no matter who I'm up against or what happens to me. Why do I feel so aggressive? This prison guard… Now, he wants to do to me what he did to the other guard. But that's fine. He's no match for my Stone Ocean. Stone Ocean! I can see it, FE. I can see your strongest point. It's the thread-like thing coming out of your muscles. It's beautiful. So that's your strongest power. His movements just now… Though his fight with the other guard was uncanny and brutal, it was still just a brawl. But now, his movements are beyond what humans can do! I have to defeat him with all my power as fast as I can! The guard's muscles… They are shining beautifully. Also, the sequence of his movements just now… How is a human capable of ignoring fear and pain to exert that much force when attacking and jumping? But if the beautiful lights emanating from his muscles indicate his strongest parts, then that leg of his right now… That's the leg I att*cked. My att*ck was effective! I can feel it. I can tell that my att*ck did some deep damage to his leg! Bastard. Who said you can walk in front of me? You're pissing me off! The others have started fighting too. Take this! Damn prison guard! I must incapacitate him as quickly as I can and focus on finding the bone! Good thing you didn't wring your own neck with that swing of yours. Now, just stay there! What the hell just happened? How did he att*ck me? This prison guard! What did you do just now? This is… So he is also a Stand User. There's more than one User in this Disciplinary Wing. He already had a Stand on a disc! But what did he do, and how? I left him no chance to counter me. And I didn't see his Stand, so how did he att*ck me? It's deep. f*ck, it's deep. He can't leave a wound this deep with a stashed razor blade or a Kn*fe. Just what did he do to me? If he has a power-type Stand, then I should be able to see it! FE. You use threads to att*ck. I see threads and a bundle of them in your body. Your strongest power comes from using this ability. That's what makes you strong. How beautiful. I can see your shine. When did you become a Stand User? Yesterday? Or a moment ago? I saw it! I saw his Stand! His Stand took form! A Stand User… So this bastard is the assassin sent to eliminate me. Strings do not require power to defend. A punch's straight trajectory can easily be changed by throwing it off by just a little. Right into my trap. Now that you've used both of your arms, I can restrict all your movements. In other words… you'll get covered with my jacket. Stone Ocean! I won't let you get back up. Wha… what? It's happening again! What does his Stand do? No, I can't see it! What did it do? I have you now! You're just a piece of sh*t. You've made a fool out of me. How dare you. Prisoners are the scum of society. Nothing infuriates me more than scum like you treating me like sh*t. I spent every day on duty irritated like this. How dare you look down on me. I'll make you pay. I'm not holding back anymore! I'll release my anger now. I won't hold anything back. I'll make sure you pay. I am the strongest! I'm going crazy, and you're going to get it! What's that on the ceiling window? No, so his Stand is… This isn't good! At this rate, I'll be… I have to get away! His Stand's att*ck is coming towards me! I got you now. I've completely locked you in. Did you forget that I'm a prison guard? I detain prisoners almost every day at my job. Your right hand may seem to be free, but this headlock does more than choke. I'm also twisting the joint on your left shoulder so that your right arm goes dead and doesn't rise. Your right hand won't reach my face. This headlock has one weakness, which I know very well. Your right hand is free to grab my balls. Of course, I wouldn't mind that if the situation were different. But I can even block that too! It's coming! If I don't do something, his Stand's true form will… That ceiling! The ceiling window's hard glass… Those cracks! I have to break free! Stone Ocean! I tore his eardrum! His grip loosened! The universe is full of countless space rocks and debris. Many of such rocks are drawn in by the gravitational pull of the earth. While the majority disintegrate before reaching the surface, what if the meteorites could retain optimal angle and speed while entering the atmosphere? STAND NAME: STARLIGHT WAVES STAND MASTER: VIVIANO WESTWOOD Oh, so you're coming too. I can do this by myself. I make and call the sh*ts around here. Yes, I asked for your help, but let's make that clear. Also, if Pale Snake really is determined to eliminate Jolyne, he must have sent two assassins, no, even more than that. There must be at least three Stand Users after Jolyne's life. You and I will get rid of them, then meet back here. Got that? Fine. I plan to be back before that guard wakes up. Also, we already agreed that I'll marry Jolyne. Don't forget that. Yeah, so about that… What the hell do you mean? I really don't get you. Meteorites! His att*cks are the meteorites that are drawn to this prison guard! That's what was smashing into me. His Stand attracts meteorites from space. But they always burn away before they can hit him. And another one will fall. He'll attract another one! Before that happens… I got you! This time, I won't let go! I'll be the victor, shining beautifully. I am the strongest! Stone Ocean! I'll strip off your skin from toe to head! Now let me go, you f*cking guard! He loosened his grip! I barely dodged them. I tried to deflect the meteorites toward him, but it's just like the last time. Not a single meteorite will hit him. They disintegrate the moment before they hit him! That prison guard's Stand ability attracts the falling meteorites toward his body like a magnet! But no matter what I try, the meteorites hit only me when I get close to him. How bizarre. Burning rocks are falling toward me from the sky. Are they meteorites? Could this be my strongest power? FE. How many of them have smashed into you? Your wounds look serious. They got both your arms, your left ribs, and your right leg. So that's five times. Or is that six? The next one will be your fatal blow. What a bluff. You are barely able to stand right now. Not even, you are just trying to fool me with that stance. In truth, you can't fight me with those arms anymore. Your arm muscles are pitch-black. The muscles have really lost their shine. Why don't we fool around a bit? Let's see how bad your damage is. What's the matter? Come on, give me a swing. I'm not even blocking. Here, att*ck me. How do you want to punch me? I'll even close my eyes for you. Over there! That little thing he's got. That's the bone Pale Snake is after! That's the bone! It's right over there! You can't even fight anymore! You are using the wall to block the meteorites. I knew you'd try that! Meteorites were already crashing towards me from the other side of the wall! I won! I knew it, you are so damaged that you can't even block my blows! One stared at the wall While the other looked up at the stars On the other side of the bars Which am I? And now, one more hit! The bone is right over there. I will do anything to get close to Pale Snake. I'll even drink sewage water. I'll even become the strongest! I win! There's no way for you to escape the meteorite now! Of course, I want to look up at the stars. I want to keep looking at them until I see Dad again. Good grief. Here comes your final blow! You're done for! I can't dodge this final blow. I can't block it with Stone Ocean anymore. I am superior! But… I did manage to slip off your right shoe. She even put a brick in my boot! She took the hit, but the damage was halved! She changed its course! The meteorite will disintegrate. It's impossible to hit you with it. I'm strictly speaking about the meteorite, that is. My boot! Seriously, good grief. You bitch! Stone Ocean! What is up with this bitch? She really doesn't give up. She doesn't give up at all. Dammit. Yes, if the meteorite collides into something else first, then she can hit me with it. How terrible. How dare she do such a terrible thing against me. This woman… I choose to look up at the stars. Match over!
05x17 - Enter the Dragon's Dream / Enter the Drake's DreamQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:28My dear friend, Dio's bone. What's happening? Where is the bone? Where is his bone? Now tell me! I feel the bone's presence from the Ultra Security House Unit. Then Jolyne got punished on purpose so that she gets confined at the Disciplinary Wing to find the bone! Yes. But it's too reckless. If I can obtain the bone first, Pale Snake will come after me. And with him, my father's stolen memory disc in his hand! That small man… I must find him. He has the bone! Is he hiding somewhere? What if someone gets that small man before I do? I must obtain the bone before I lose it again. What happened here? They are already done fighting. And everyone in the Disciplinary Wing is abnormally bloated. It's a Stand. How many other Stand Users were sent here? Are they the ones who did this? Just what exactly did they do? No, one User only has one Stand. These prisoners were defeated by just one of these two guys. How many other Stand Users were sent to this Disciplinary Wing? At the least, there is one more User who manipulates others into fighting by stimulating their minds. Can you stand with that injury of yours? That thread Stand of yours was most fascinating. Especially since it's impossible to predict its next move. Even more intriguing, though, is your mental strength. Despite the damage to your body, I can sense the growth you've had since the last battle. When Pale Snake said he would send four Stand Users, including myself, I questioned his judgment for sending such an excessive number of us. But now, I understand him a little better. Especially since he wishes to finish you off completely. I am Kenzou,  years old. The secret to my longevity is eight and a half hours of sleep a day and my daily "urine therapy," with just one cup every morning. The important thing is to keep the habit going. Have you heard of "urine therapy"? If you want a fight, I won't back down. American-style. French-style. Japanese-style. Italian-style, specifically Naples. Those are "f*ck you" gestures from around the globe. I will start by telling you the conclusion. These prisoners drowned to death. I drowned them, so their bodies are bloated like that. And it seems that I won't be facing you just yet. F.F.! sh*t. He knew I was sneaking up on him from the bloated bodies. My preemptive strike failed. Not only that, but that bloated corpse got in the way of my F.F. g*n. Close call. F.F., how did you get in here? I made it in the nick of time. Looks like you're in some deep sh*t. I'll fill up your wounds in a second. That man… who was he again? Right, he was at Emporio's hideout with Weather Forecast. Before I heal you, Jolyne, I'll take care of this geezer! Southeast,  degrees,  minutes, and  seconds. Their sweat… It will drip. Will they open their mouth? Do you want to drown? Drown? I don't know what your plans are, but I sure love water. See if it works on me-- The time it takes for humans to drown in water is between five to seven minutes for those who have been trained. That's only if there's air left in the lungs. But let's say all the air is sucked out from both lungs. In this condition, humans drown to death instantly with a mere few drops of water! I directly struck your fourth cervical vertebra by going through your throat. It contains nerves connected to your kidney. The adrenal gland! It produces bodily fluids that lubricate the respiratory system like oil does to an engine. Even a few drops of water will make you feel as if you are being swallowed up in a giant wave! I can't breathe! Right now, I'm in the body of an average human, Atroe. This is bad, this body won't last! F.F.! Do you want to drown too? Jolyne Cujoh! I have you! What are you? Are you really human? Don't stand. Just observe them from here for now. Shouldn't you be assessing what kind of Stand User that geezer is? The problem here is not that he drowned those prisoners, but that he dodged every b*llet. It may seem insignificant, but how did he do that? That's more dangerous, don't you think? What brought you here? Your name is Anastasia, right? I love you. I couldn't wait to be here with you. Say what now? That old man has been incarcerated here for  years now. He's an idiot who drinks his own piss. I thought I hadn't seen him at the male wing for a while, but who would've guessed he was here? Even worse, he now has a Stand. In the autumn of , this geezer k*lled  people, all young men and women. His sentence is for  years. Though he's old now, he was  when he received his sentence. He was the self-proclaimed founder of a cult. His sect was so popular that even Hollywood stars joined it. However, his cult's activities clashed with society,  so the police and the FBI intervened. Cornered, this geezer locked himself and  of his followers in an estate here in Florida. He attempted to burn everyone to death. Kenzou drugged every follower and set the building on fire. All the believers b*rned to death, but the founder survived. Strangely enough, it so happened that a part of the wall collapsed on him, protecting him from the smoke and fire. He was barely alive when he was rescued. There's no doubt he intended to die. What am I trying to say? Who knows. I can't say for myself. Either way, Kenzou alone survived. He cannot leave this prison, but he wasn't put to death, either. These are the facts surrounding this man. I don't know what you are, but I can tell your strongest power. The secrets to your strength, yes. I can clearly sense something else other than blood running through your veins. Is that your Stand? Or are you an entirely different being? Those things do not change your weakness. Your weak points and body structure are the same as any other human, including the blood flowing within you. Do you want to drown again? This time, you will not survive. Southwest,  degrees,  minutes. He made something appear in his hands again. What is that? And what is his weird footwork for? Let's see the direction of your dragon. F.F., it's behind you! Wrong. It's useless, so stop attacking me! STAND NAME: DRAKE'S DREAM STAND MASTER: KENZOU Wrong. It's useless. So stop attacking me. I said, your enemy is the geezer! You don't listen, do you? I don't pick sides. Your att*cks will only pass through me. Face forward! You better watch out. The geezer's coming for you! I have no right to butt in. Mind you, the geezer. The geezer is your enemy. This dragon! Is this dragon's ability allowing Kenzou to dodge my b*ll*ts? And here he comes. This speed… Those don't seem like punches from a -year-old. Now I can enter the dragon. What's going on? What did he do to his own arm? His arm flew behind F.F.'s head! That was close. But they blocked his att*ck in their own weird way. His arm disappeared the moment he touched that dragon Stand. Does it conceal the direction of his next strike? What is that dragon-like thing? Does your arm fly off when you touch that dragon? You still punch like an old geezer, though. Wrong, F.F. I can already see what will happen. But no one else can predict it. Don't say unnecessary things! Stop your yapping. You are supposed to stay neutral! You're keeping it to yourself, that's not fair! Just tell them! You opened your mouth. F.F.! Was that a coincidence just now? That prisoner's glasses flew up and stabbed F.F's face! Unlucky direction. I'm starting to understand it. He's using feng shui. There is a principle called feng shui in East Asia. Kenzou's footsteps pointing to cardinal directions indicate it. As if predetermined, he advances his att*cks from one direction. Furthermore, the Stand in his hands… Kenzou uses that dragon-like Stand to choose his direction of att*ck. Feng shui? What's that? Direction of att*ck? Feng shui. It's a divination method much like tarot card reading and astrology, except it's not fortune-telling. According to Eastern philosophy, there are natural forms of energy such as wind energy and water energy flowing through mountains and valleys. The flow of such energy is used to guide one's life. For example, feng shui is used to determine the luck found in an area, house, and even a room. If the land or house faces an unlucky direction, it is said to affect the wealth, health, and fortune of those who live there. In times of w*r, an enemy castle's feng shui was read to decide which direction to att*ck from in order to make the enemy fall. On the other hand, temples were built at castles' unlucky directions to counteract bad fortune. This provided further protection to strongholds. Not only that, but feng shui's philosophy is even applied to human anatomy. There's such thing as assassination feng shui. You can use feng shui to determine the luckiest direction of att*ck against a human. Then, no matter how the opponent tries to block the advances, it is possible to approach the target without letting them in on the offensive. Thus, making the assassination easy. In other words, the unlucky orientation. Kenzou's Stand must rely on this principle. F.F. must fight against the direction of worst luck. That dragon Stand points to the best direction for a k*lling blow. When that geezer's att*ck overlaps with the dragon's location, F.F.'s fate is sealed. Who would've thought that Kenzou has mastered assassination feng shui during his  years in prison, manifesting it as his Stand ability! Feng shui shows the direction he should take. The same concept applies for defending. F.F. missed every sh*t. That was the reason! It's because feng shui worked in his favor and protected him. Is that right? Undoubtedly. When he has the dragon in his hands, he can read his safest direction. After moving to that area, he then prepares to strike. The dragon points to the orientation best for k*lling. F.F.! It wasn't a coincidence that the glasses hit you! Don't let Kenzou move toward the dragon! I don't really understand it, but you must not let Kenzou touch the dragon! Look at that, Drake's Dream! They figured out my trick because of your blabbering! Shut up, old freak. I'm not your henchman! Feng shui should be open to anyone. But it's true that the old geezer benefits most from me. F.F., this area is your worst luck. Just above your left ear. This area is the worst weak point for you. Your lucky color is yellow, and pictures of goldfish bring you luck. If you have any, that is. F.F., he's behind you! So you'll chop me, will you? I don't even need to position myself in the dragon's orientation. His defensive stance is also an att*ck. Must be derived from tai chi. Your mouth is mine! Another instance where the defensive stance is also an att*ck. You wench! Using the dragon's orientation seems to be the surest path to victory. I made your hand overlap with the dragon! It works the same as if I att*ck. Your own arm will now hurt you! My att*ck overlapped with your orientation of death! Bastard, what did you just do to me? What did you do with my arm just now? I just said it's the orientation for worst luck. That's the power of orientation for you. I can't predict what happens next, and if I were you, I'd try to reduce the damage to a minimum. F.F., get away from there! The meteorites destroyed the supports! The fan will fall on you! Oh, the fan isn't your thr*at. The boomerang is. F.F.!
05x18 - Enter the Foo Fighters / Enter the F.F.QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:29Is there anything you can do for us? All right. Okay. I can go defend her. Jolyne Cujoh, that is. I'll take care of this geezer! Southeast,  degrees,  minutes and  seconds. This time, you will not survive. Face southwest,  degrees,  minutes. F.F., it's behind you! I said, your enemy is the geezer! His arm flew behind F.F's head! Was that a coincidence just now? That prisoner's glasses flew up and stabbed F.F.'s face! Unlucky direction. I'm starting to understand it. He's using feng shui. There is a principle called feng shui in East Asia. Kenzou uses that dragon-like Stand to choose his direction of att*ck. F.F., this area is your worst luck. Just above your left ear. My att*ck overlapped with your orientation of death! F.F.! No… this is seriously bad. Stop. You cannot save them. The direction of our worst luck exists for you and me as well. And once it's decided, no living being can escape it. It was proven to us just now. Their next target will be you. No. I'm not talking about their head getting chopped in half. I'd rather that their head bleed profusely. It's worse that they're barely bleeding at all. All the damage has depleted the water levels in their body. The plankton in their body are starting to die off! I'm glad it's not gushing out. But that was the unluckiest direction, without a doubt. EPISODE : ENTER THE F.F. What? Return to me, dragon! That almost finished you off, geezer! Never… Never again! Never will I set my foot off of the direction of safety! sh*t, he escaped to a safe area. But… I'm starting to understand the orientations, and ways around it! A mirror… I need to make a mirror! If only there was a mirror midair, then I can reflect that dragon on it. I can trick Kenzou into stepping towards a fake direction of safety. Then, I'd have a chance to b*at him down. But first, I must have water. I can make a mirror out of water. I need water to heal from all the damage too, but right now, I need to replenish on water to create a mirror midair! In the past, over , believers followed my teachings and walked in my steps. But ever since I came to this prison, my life has changed. I'm mocked. Everyone mocks me and laughs at me. Even a pedophile who kidnapped children ridiculed me. Forty years… I've suffered this for  years! I was once respected! Forty years ago, I basked in glory! And those days will come again. The feng shui which saved me from the ravaging fire has now taken form as my Stand! I will reign as Founder once again! Though I may fail to break out of here, fervent followers will return to me! After I finish you off, that is! Now, meet your end! Drake's Dream! Reveal to me the direction of the finishing blow! F.F., just beyond the stairs! There's a fire hose! Hey, you. Don't just stand there and explain things. Go help F.F.! You have a Stand, don't you? Fight with F.F. to finish off that geezer! Only if F.F. dies. My terms do not include helping F.F. Our deal only extends to saving you. Besides, F.F. themself said they don't want any help. When they saw your injuries, F.F. directed me to protect you from the enemies in this Disciplinary Wing. Where is it? How do I make water come out? Where is the valve? Don't come here. This area contains your worst luck yet. Guard against it at all costs. Or else, you will be dealt a decisive and fatal blow. You don't have time to drink water! Of their own volition? F.F., what the hell are you doing? The att*ck against you has been decided! What are you thinking? F.F. must have water above anything else. Even in the way of a decided att*ck or the zone of worst luck. They got rid of their arms on purpose so that they could fit into that hose. They did it! They finally have water-- That's your own arm. Here comes the assassination feng shui. Looks like you desperately wanted water, but you will never be at an advantage from now on. My att*ck will only bring you the worst luck. Such is the assassination feng shui, Drake's Dream! That's what it means to have your fate sealed! They couldn't reach water. They didn't even touch it! What happens now? Underneath this Disciplinary Wing is the execution room. The State of Florida permits the death penalty. Two or three prisoners a year are ex*cuted on a ,-volt electric chair. D-damn… I was so close to touching the water. But I did bust the pipe. I need to reach the water upstairs somehow. At this rate, I'll… Plankton like them would perish in an instant. sh*t! This chair, it can't be! What? Don't tell me it's already on! Does that sound mean the electricity is ready to run? Bullshit! I won't let it run! Let's see what kind of an end you'll meet with my att*cks. Anyone can predict the outcome of this situation at this point. Before it turns on, I will get the drops of water dripping from the ceiling! Looks like your place on that chair was already decided by fate. Take this! Behold, you will never obtain water. And that was right on time. You will now meet your end! STAND NAME: F.F. STAND MASTER: F.F. F.F.! The absolute orientation of att*ck and flawless direction of defense. Assassination feng shui. It took  years, but I can now say I have mastered it. The Founder reigns again! With this, I'll go down in history as a Buddha equal to Shakyamuni! You know I'm supposed to stay neutral. I'm in no position to tell you this, geezer. But F.F. finally got the water they wanted. If it weren't for your kick, they wouldn't have had any. You ran a little too much, you -year-old man. You can't help but sweat when they had you running all over the place. And your perspiration became the water they needed. F.F. made a mirror out of your sweat. With enough sweat to fill a third of a cup, they can form a floating mirror. What I'm saying is that you're seeing my reflection. So you are by no means standing in the orientation of safety. It's a draw. The only chance at defeating assassination feng shui is a draw. They have braced themself for this moment. That's right, take this. I'll share this unluckiest fate with you! The direction of safety… F.F.… It's over. On to the next. You wanted to look for the bone, right? We must start thinking ahead. At the least, you won't fall victim to Kenzou's assassination feng shui now. It was indeed a formidable Stand. F.F.! Inconceivable. Jolyne Cujoh, what are you doing? Your body has suffered more damage than you realize! The colony of plankton inside F.F.'s body has already been wiped out by , volts of electricity. You know better than anyone else! B-But the dragon… The dragon is still here! They must have let go of him a moment too early. Or it could be that plankton are more susceptible to electricity than humans. Kenzou is still alive! Wait! You cannot manifest your Stand with that body! Has revenge driven you mad? I won't let him stay alive like this. Stone Ocean! You cannot hit me. I will finish you and reign as the Founder once again! I see it now. So that's the direction of safety. So I see. You were after Kenzou's direction of safety. Once you identified the direction impervious from every att*ck, then F.F., who scattered along with the mirror, should be safe in this spot. The plankton there should've been safe from the , volts. You att*cked him to find this exact spot. F.F. survived. Good grief. How could this be? Jolyne! You think you've won now, do you? You think you have defeated me? Jolyne Cujoh. There is no change in my plans to defeat you. You haven't noticed, now have you? You have already… stepped inside my assassination feng shui's direction! My thread is inside the dragon! The att*ck is absolute! Your worst luck has now been decided! It doesn't matter how I choose to att*ck, because your defeat is already decided! I won! Now, kneel before me! The Founder's reign cannot be altered! What? Hey… I dealt a blow, didn't I, Drake's Dream? Assassination feng shui is absolute. My deadly kick should have defeated Jolyne, isn't that right? Yeah, she couldn't dodge your deadly blow. Then how is Jolyne unscathed, while I'm clinging to this fence? What? Dragon, show me the direction of safety… Come now, dragon, why are you moving away? Tell me the direction of safety! Why won't you come closer? I want to ask that myself. You are the one getting farther away. You let go of that railing, and now you are falling down. Why are you just blabbering? I said, tell me the direction! I told you, you are the one getting farther away. Geezer, look at your own legs. Something is really wrong with it. There's something off about them. You could have gotten att*cked when you kicked Jolyne. Oh, that's… What the hell? That's not her thread Stand! What is that Stand emerging out of Jolyne Cujoh's body? Diver Drive. I submerged it into her body. Though the att*ck on Jolyne was decided, it protected her precisely at the moment of your blow. What the hell? This man who came with F.F., Anastasia. He put his own Stand into my body and destroyed Kenzou's legs in an instant. His bones and muscles were entirely disassembled. They were then rearranged into this spring-like shape. It is now a suspension made of meat and bones. However, Kenzou is not feeling any pain. But I don't feel pain either, thanks to that Stand that manipulated the guards into fighting. But… Even my hips! I need the direction of safety, dragon! I can't reach it! I'm coming your way! Is he really an ally? He's capable of dealing such terrible damage. Just who is this man? That's it. I love that. Yes, I want you to gaze at me more. Look at me with those eyes. The direction of safety is northeast and your lucky color is cerulean blue. But you know… I think you're done for. You sure aged a ton in a fight that lasted a few minutes. KENZOU ( YEARS OLD) STAND NAME: DRAKE'S DREAM BEYOND RECOVERY Are you okay, Jolyne? Yes… The pain is hitting me all of a sudden. But I have to find the bone and the small man who picked it up. Wait just a moment. I can fill your wounds. Hurry. I have to get it back soon. My father's disc.
05x19 - Birth of the 'Green'QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:29He is currently in a sleep state. He wakes up sitting up cross-legged, stays awake for a few hours, then falls asleep for another  hours. It's all understandable. His entire memory is gone, after all. How is he retaining new information since getting resuscitated? It's normal. He has learned about  English words so far. However, he does not comprehend his identity. Even his family… He doesn't show any response, even to his daughter's photos. His brain waves and EKG are within normal parameters. But his muscle mass has decreased. With all his memories gone, he does not feel any reason to live, causing the body to rapidly atrophy. What can we do, Doctor? I cannot say. His only chance of recovery might be retrieving his memory. Doctor, do not touch his head! He got hurt! We must treat him! I'm sorry, Doctor. I forgot to warn you. Did he use his Stand just now? He did. However, that wasn't from his consciousness. It was just his instinctive bodily reflex to defend. "Jo… Lyne." "Jolyne"? No… that's not possible. I've always… I've always cared about you. Something's going on with your cut. It was fixed. I know I just filled it in. It looks like some sort of writing, doesn't it? Should I try to fill it again? Wait. Don't fill this one. I can't explain it, but… I just know it. This is a message from my father. He's had so much to protect even before I was born. He was always away to keep dangers like the one I'm in now away from me and Mom. I felt it, just now.  My body tells me that I understand my father now. EPISODE : BIRTH OF THE "GREEN" -Hey F.F. -What? Can you trip Jolyne down the stairs? Just a little bit will do. Why would I do that? I said, try to trip her. We won't let her get hurt, of course. I want to catch her from falling with my own arms. What? Jolyne doesn't seem like she understood that I saved her. I want to embrace her tightly one more time. Now, get to it. -Trip her. -Why don't you do it? That's sexual harassment. I already told you. I'm going to marry Jolyne. And you promised to cooperate. Or do you not keep your word? Now, go do it. I'm sorry, Jolyne. The small man! He's right here! He was spying on us from above! Look! He has the bone in his hand! This fucker sure moves in a funny way, but he won't get away! Hold it! Do you see his back contorting? You called him a small man. It's true he fit the description earlier. -But something strange is happening… -Sunbathing… Isn't he growing taller? He's as tall as me, no, he's taller than me now. You have nowhere to run. Turn around slowly. The sunlight is nice and warm. Light is good. I said turn around, you little sh*t! Bleh… Bleh. What the f*ck is with him? Light, bleh, warm. We are happy… as we gather around… and it's warm. Bleh. What was that? Did you see that stuff splatter? He could be a Stand User! Keep your distance. It doesn't seem to be a Stand. I don't know what it is, but we mustn't touch him. Where's the bone? The bone he had earlier. Where is it now? What the… The other prisoners have already fallen prey. Those look like plants. They're still growing. What happened to them, and who did this? What is the meaning of this? Should I assume that it's a Stand ability? This bone, along with the power and some sort of will that sprouted these plants… It's as if they are trying to give birth to something. It bloomed the flowers first, then the plants matured. They grew out at the end of the person's life. Now, what to do with this bone that the man dropped… Merely touching this bone or anyone who grabbed it can be dangerous, after all. Don't take another step, Jolyne Cujoh! Stop right there! Show me your face. Turn around. -What? -It's nothing. I want to take a moment to check something. What the hell is wrong with you? Let go of her, assh*le! F.F., you stay silent. The bone transformed the prisoners in the Disciplinary Wing into that state. It can't be an enemy Stand, since that would have targeted us from the start. And if I'm not mistaken, Jolyne, I think I saw your thread touching that bone when it was still in his grasp. The bone! It's rolling away! She's infected! Jolyne! But how? Diver Drive! Yes! Weed them all out from the inside, quick! There's more! Why did you stop? I wouldn't exactly say they're growing out of her or that they need to be rooted out. Rather, her body itself is transforming into plants. Is it safe to pull them out? Jolyne, does it hurt? No. I guess I did touch that bone. Anyway, you should stay away from me now that I'm infected. It might spread to you. These are just plants, nothing more, nothing less. I can't tell what species they are, but its stems are filled with chlorophyll, not blood. Either way, I'll take care of it. I promise. The sunlight! Get in the shade. If you touch sunlight or move toward the light, the plants will grow rapidly. Step farther into the shade, and the plants recede. Damn, what does it want? I can't say, but I still need to get that bone. And just how will you do that? If you hold the bone, you'll turn into a plant, Jolyne! I will pick it up. I'm already becoming a plant. Don't go where the sunlight touches, Jolyne! The bone… Where is it? Where can it be? I thought I saw it rolling towards this flower. A star shape? What is this bruise-like mark? It's see-through. There's something else underneath. A child… It's a green child! STAND NAME: YA-YA MA STAND MASTER: D AN' G What is it shaped like? Carrots that look like Snoopy, breast-shaped radishes, and other shapes are found all the time during harvests. This is just like those. It really just resembles a child. It's alive! Impossible! Jolyne, forget about it and come back! Haven't you noticed? Your legs are turning too. They are attaching to the vines! What is this thing? Is it a plant, or is it a human? It turned the prisoners in the Disciplinary Wing into plants, joined their roots, and became a fruit! The bone must have gotten implanted inside this fruit. Pale Snake is at this prison to discover what lies beyond this point. What will it spawn? He wants to know what transpires when it is born. I told you to come back, Jolyne. The sun is moving westward, causing more sunlight to enter. You must move further back. Are you taking that with you? We call this seizing by force, F.F. I will not let Pale Snake have it. Come, Jolyne. We must move opposite the sun's direction. Anastasia. This wing's entrance is to the west. We'll never leave this shitty place if we go east. There's at least one other Stand User somewhere in this wing. Escape, huh. Help me, please. Someone help! Please! After everyone drowned, they turned into plants and d*ed! How horrible! I'm begging you! I don't want to turn into a plant! Please, get me out of here! Fine. What's your name? Are you hurt? What are you saying, Anastasia? He could be our enemy. Are they right? Are you against us? I don't know what you are talking about. My name is Guccio. I just don't want to turn into a plant! Calm down. I said it's fine. Stand up, Guccio. Surely you can do that much. Now hurry it up. Do you know this? A human has  pairs of ribs, or  bones in total. Whether a man or a woman, tall or short, we all have the same number of ribs. Good. Now go. I guess he wasn't our enemy after all. I couldn't care less either way. I'm only interested in safely leaving through the east side of this building. Isn't that right? The keyword is "safely." Let's leave from there. A green child… I wasn't told about any of this, but my job is simple. Finish off Jolyne Cujoh. Just that, and nothing more. I will merely complete my assignment. Where are they? Where did Jolyne Cujoh and her two allies go? Have they already left the building? No, they cannot leave without me knowing. Hey you, what are you doing there? Hey, I'm talking to you. Where did those three go? And how did you manage to avoid becoming a plant? Walk… outside… -Save me… -How terrible. Someone restructured his body into a human trap! f*ck, it hurts! Mommy, it hurts! I don't want this shitty arm anymore! I got screwed. I'm only here because Pale Snake ordered me to cause a fight in here with my Survivor Stand. But forget that now. I'm finally outside now. GUCCIO STAND NAME: SURVIVOR - BEYOND RECOVERY Anyway, it looks like we got away from the other Stand User. The plants withered away. I guess it was a temporary bloom. The problem is that it's about time for someone from the prison to realize the abnormalities going on in the Disciplinary Wing. That works in our favor. Once that happens, then Pale Snake will realize it too. He will appear close to us. This is the best chance yet of getting my father's disc back. Jolyne, watch out! Stone Ocean! It's an enemy Stand! He must belong to that gladiator-looking man! He swallowed the fruit! I won't let them have it! assh*le! Diver Drive! What is up with his body? He stinks… really bad! Go deeper, please! -sh*t, my Stand can't enter it! -Punish me more, please! I can feel it through my Stand! My body's starting to stink from the inside! Those shoes of yours. Did my bodily liquid dirty them? I am very sorry. Now please, come sit on this chair. Let me lick your shoes clean. Would you like this comic book? I lifted it from the guards' break room. Careful, there's a bee. My master is named D an' G. The last I saw of him, he was in the Disciplinary Wing. His right arm got ripped off and he was crying for his mommy. It's a remotely controlled Stand! He wants to take the fruit to his User! sh*t, they've noticed. The guards are coming! Jolyne, we must leave for now. Let's go toward the wetlands. There must be a water bike or a boat somewhere close. This is how to tell wild strawberries apart. The ones with yellow flowers are mock strawberries, so don't eat them. Shut your annoying trap. We can't leave this Stand alone. We need to find a way to get that green child out of its belly. I know that. F.F., we have no choice but to take it. We'll leave you to find its User and finish him off. Got it. Oh, you want me to go with you, Master. This boat here is built specifically for the wetlands, Master. It has a propeller engine, and it uses wind to propel forward. sh*t, how do I start the ignition? Is there a lock somewhere? It's a throttle lever, Master. Usually, it must be put in neutral first, like this. This stick is for steering. Push it forward to turn the empennage to the right, and pull the stick back to turn it to the left. -Release the tether. -Yes, Master. Jolyne, do not take your eyes off that Stand. While it's in your sight, it'll act like an obedient servant. Though creepy, it will prove useful to you. But turn your back on it for a second, and… f*ck… Who would have thought that was an att*ck? Jolyne, Anastasia… Don't let it out of your sight!
05x20 - F.F. – The WitnessQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:30Do not chase the bone. Leave it be. Let his bone wander about freely. Then, I will combine it with Jotaro Kujo's memory. I will learn the truth! The bone must have gotten implanted inside this green fruit. Pale Snake is at this prison to discover what lies beyond this point. What will it spawn? He wants to know what transpires when it is born. We'll leave you to find its User and finish him off. f*ck… Who would have thought that was an att*ck? His bodily fluids… He used his spit to destroy my mouth before I realized it. He att*cked me slowly, little by little. What should I do? Should I go after Jolyne's boat? No. I will stick to my mission and go finish off that Stand's User. This is the most definite way. EPISODE : F.F. - THE WITNESS Hey you. Head toward that island. Why are we stopping at this hidden place? Hey, turn off the engine. Don't make a sound. Don't you hear that? I said hurry up and turn off the engine, idiot! Emergency in the Disciplinary Wing area. The entire facility is on Level  security. Stay on high alert! That's a .mm M heavy machine g*n. Its range is , to , meters. A mere graze from that b*llet would blow our limbs off. This old boat would be sh*t into pieces. Hey, shut up. You're shaking the boat. Stay away from the steering! Stay calm. If they had spotted us, we would've been sh*t at. Ten o'clock. There was an unusual splashing by the bushes. Maybe a fish or an alligator? They're coming. We should leave! Grab the leaves like this, master. I told you to be quiet, dimwit! No. I'm folding these leaves in half. Here, let's weave it and rest it here. Stick them here like this. And now, let's paint your face. Excellent. Good, now let's get your face ready. Emergency report! All guards, return to the Disciplinary Wing! I repeat, everyone back to their posts! Turn back? I'm not sure what's happening, but it sounds pretty serious. Let's head back. Where the hell did these guys come from? Damn! Turn the engine on, hurry up! It won't start in time! We'll get sh*t before it gets going! You there! What have you done at the Disciplinary Wing? Listen! Do not move! Put your hands on the floor! Stay down! I said don't move, bastard! Hit the ground, now! -Our boat! -We can take their boat. And you're doing it for us. What just hit us? I'm taking this boat. I'm sure you don't mind. Don't get eaten by alligators on your way back. Diver Drive! Jolyne, are the plants still growing inside you? Let's continue heading east. The sun is still going down. So mean, tossing me around like I was a sack… Oh, well. Hey Jolyne, I'm sorry, but can you stop whistling? We might hear the guards' boats again. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, ANASTASIA? ANASTASIA! HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME? I can't speak! ANASTASIA! MY VOICE! IT'S NOT COMING OUT! ANASTASIA! This Stand… He's here to do more than just run off with the green child! He was slowly attacking us! What's the matter? You are breathing hard. I feel the same way, Jolyne. Can you feel my heart pounding? You are suddenly getting close to me. Do you finally understand how I feel for you? Not my eyes, my tongue! Are you at a loss for words? I know how you feel. But there's no need for words between us. I feel the same about you. You're dying to kiss me, right? You want a deep kiss already? When, and how did he att*ck us? I didn't notice at all. I have to keep him in my sights! Jolyne… Well, which is it? Do you want to kiss, or not? I know, is this a kink? Like, you are particular about your kissing angle… An auto-tracking Stand. It follows our orders like a sl*ve and acts docile like a servant. It pretends to be harmless. But that's his method. It's a Stand that strikes when its prey lets their guard down! At this rate, we're both toast. Bring it on. Try to att*ck me. I must make Anastasia see what's happening. YA-YA MA. That's my name. YA-YA MA. Let me show you how to tan frog hide. Look here. Rub this mixture made of fat and brains all creamy and thick on the back of the frog skin. This smoothes the hide. If you want, I can go get ten more and tailor up the coolest super mini-skirt using their hide. It'll make your legs look ultra-long and slim, and your hips will look wide! Jolyne, what is the matter? Seriously. If a trigger is necessary, there must be a trigger to his att*cks! And if they're a*t*matic, then… This is what I was waiting for. I covered my skin with my threads and waited for something to touch it. His att*cks set off automatically when we turn away. That's his ability. And now, I know how he att*cks. He uses mosquitoes! Jolyne, what's going on? Jolyne! Was I wrong? Does he not use mosquitoes? Or is he attacking in other ways too? BE ALL EYES DON'T EVER LOOK AWAY You… Bastard! Master, you want me to keep driving this boat? Or do you want to fight me one-on-one? Or will you escape-- I was wrong. He doesn't use mosquitoes. He att*cks in other ways. Yes, give me more! He att*cks in a way that can't be seen by the naked eye! Run! I do believe this is your last chance to escape. I hope you are prepared. Prepared to regret ever being born in this world. STAND NAME: DIVER DRIVE STAND MASTER: NARCISO ANASTASIA Go to the back of the boat, at the corner of the port! Take out everything you're hiding. Spread them out by my feet. Now, show them to me! Two rhino beetles, a microphone for singing, low-calorie sugar packs, and three frogs. One raw frog hide, a bundle of broccoli, four mock strawberries, and two used matchsticks. No, his belongings are irrelevant. We are upwind of him, yet he is able to att*ck us. An auto-tracking Stand… Your target is set, is that right? Yes sir, my target is absolutely locked on to Jolyne Cujoh since the very first time I touched her. Your User commanded you to target her. You won't try to escape until you've finished her off. YA-YA MA. And if you want to be by her side, master, I will finish you off along with Jolyne. Could he be using his spit to att*ck? YA-YA MA. You still don't get it, do you? You can't destroy or stop me, ever. The only way to survive was to run away from me. This boat… Should I stop it? This splattering water… If the spit he uses to att*ck has already permeated the wetland waters, then… Now, stand and go to the driver's seat. Crank up the speed. Now get up. No, you'll make things worse. If you speed up the boat, the water will splash everywhere. Yes, if that's what you want, master. Ribbit! Jolyne, he stopped attacking although the boat's speed hadn't changed. YA-YA MA. Something's not right… Birds! Hide! Diver Drive. I don't care how he att*cks. Since he is a perfect auto-tracking Stand, I buried a frog in his head and connected its brain to his tracking sensors. Try to track us as a frog as long as you exist! Wait… what was I going to do? I am an auto-tracking Stand. My mission is to defeat Jolyne Cujoh and return with the green child. Oh, dear. I have no time to be bumming around! I have to spatter my spit to att*ck Anastasia! I'll create a static charge by causing friction between the plastic and the propellers. That'll make my spit fly everywhere! He'll never figure it out! Oh, but those birds are so scary! Hide! Ew, I peed myself like those frogs do! Woah, what a cutie! Look at those curves! Let me ride you, darling! Oh, a rhino beetle! He won't bother us anymore. We need F.F.'s help to heal the wounds. All we need to do is wait for F.F. to finish D an' G off and meet up with us. What the hell happened to the Disciplinary Wing? Where are the guards and the prisoners? We've only been gone for around ten minutes! Where did these plants even come from? How do we explain this? What is that prisoner's condition? Is he able to talk? Prisoner ME, D an' G. He is in critical condition. His right arm almost got ripped off. We can't question him. I'll blow his head off for setting loose a Stand that's creepy as hell. That man, isn't he the prison's priest, Father Pucchi? What is a priest doing here? sh*t, forget about him for now. What's more important is the definite death of D an' G. Three hundred fifty-nine. Three hundred sixty-seven. Three hundred seventy-three. Three hundred seventy-nine. Three hundred eighty-three. Three hundred eighty-nine. Three hundred ninety-seven. And now, the four hundreds. First, four hundred one. Then, four hundred nine. D an' G is gravely injured, meaning… I must conclude that Jolyne Cujoh is still alive. And the plethora of withered plants… I take it that Dio's bone caused this. Dio's bone is using the prisoners' bodies to accomplish something outside of my imagination. Splendid. This is wonderful. So it has finally begun. I've been waiting for this moment for  years. What D an' G witnessed here… I must ask him what he saw, in person! Isn't that right, Survivor's Guccio? It seems you didn't see what happened, but the plants must have set something in motion. Doesn't this call for a celebration? It will be in my hands soon. What is true happiness? I will attain heaven. Sing praises. The thing that will be born is heaven itself. The curtains to the new world have risen. Splendid… Yes, praise this moment! Handel's "Messiah" is a true masterpiece! How befitting… It's as if the music exudes light. It is said that Handel led this piece even the day before his own death! All right, leave D an' G to the medics. Question him after his treatment. We must search for the other prisoners and guards. -Now, go. -Yes, sir. No, I will question him before he is treated. I must not let what was conceived get lost! Good. Now, start the car. Yes, sir. That woman… That face underneath the hat! You're done now. Those who control auto-tracking Stands are defenseless when the tables turn on them. That's the risk you bear! It's F.F.! Why are they at this Disciplinary Wing? Since when? This is bad! They were after D an' G! He has a disc! Pale Snake is nearby! Where is he? Where did he throw the disc from? Four hundred seventy-nine. Four hundred eighty-seven. Four hundred ninety-one. Four hundred ninety-nine. No way… The one who threw it was… It can't be him! This is bad. It's very bad for me. You are able to att*ck D an 'G here and now because his Stand YA-YA MA is tracking Jolyne. Pale Snake's User is… This can't be! There are things I must learn from him. I cannot have him die yet. So the one who controls Pale Snake is… If that's true, then what? Which do you prioritize? Is it me? Or is it finishing D an' G? You are… Father Pucchi. You bastard!
05x21 - AWAKENQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:31You're done now. Those who control auto-tracking Stands… It's F.F.! Why are they at this Disciplinary Wing? He has a disc! Pale Snake is nearby! Where is he? No way… The one who threw it was… It can't be him! So the one who controls Pale Snake is… You are… Father Pucchi. F.F. feared one thing above all else. It wasn't the destruction of their body, but the elimination of their own intellect. I remember everything since the day I met Jolyne. The weird graffiti on prison phones, the lint-covered blankets on the bed, and the smell of garbage. The guard's shouts, the sounds of doors opening and closing, and the toilet flushing, even. Fooling around with Jolyne and the others and laughing together. I remember them all. But before I met Jolyne at the farm, though I lived there for years, all I can recall from that time are memories that are like a machine's. That's all. I followed orders without ever questioning why and spent the days guarding Pale Snake's discs. But now, I know that to live means to make memories. I fear losing them the most. Jolyne is on a mission to save her father and is willing to risk her life for the ones she cares about like Ermes. That's probably because she has good memories of them. That's what powers humans up. Memories give humans power to keep going at a cellular level. This is an understanding that I, F.F., lacked before meeting Jolyne. That's right. That is… That is what it means to be an intelligent being. Which do you prioritize? Is it me? Or is it finishing D an' G? You hesitated for a split second! That will cost you your life! I gave you intellect and a Stand. I am taking it back. When I think about Jolyne, I feel courage swelling up inside me. This is what memories do. This is… my intellect! What? No… Is F.F. planning to-- Their bodily fluids entered his body! Impossible… Am I… Looks like F.F. did it. They must have k*lled its User. Where is the fruit? What the hell? Does this mean that it's born? Is this what Pale Snake wanted? What the hell is this thing? Why was it given life? Why does it exist here? Were the prisoners mutated just to give life to this thing? Now that it's born, my body is no longer mutating. It stopped turning into a plant. You must not let F.F. escape! Read the memory inside the disc! Tell me the whereabouts of the spawn of Dio's bone! Will I even last  seconds when I'm exposed like this? I need water. I need to tell Jolyne who Pale Snake really is! sh*t. I have to tell her that he's the prison's chaplain, Father Pucchi! Are you trying to reach the faucet at the entrance? Before you go, I have one question for you! You can't escape my Stand! There's one thing I want to ask, F.F. It's a very simple question. Did you see it? Did you see the thing born at the Disciplinary Wing? How did it look? Was it a plant? Was it beautiful? What is a priest doing at a prison like this? I hope you understand that I'm asking the questions here. I can easily extract your memory and read it to understand what was born. But I wanted to know how you felt. Things like it looked soft or that it was beautiful are your opinions, and can't be read from a memory disc. Are you worried that the spawn will escape? You're afraid of losing it. Is it able to move already? How the hell should I know? I'd be more worried about it getting destroyed. No, maybe it's already done. Jolyne is with that mean assh*le, after all. If she's compelled to, she'll finish it off. It's impossible to defeat it. That will never happen. No one can destroy it, that much I know well. My only concern is Jolyne causing trouble and losing it. Jotaro's memory alone is enough to control the birthed creature, and I have his memory. We are so close to the end. What is it shaped like? Did it grow faster than you expected? I thought it was gonna drown in water. And then, what else was there? Let's see… It's stalling for time! Turn around! I did it! My soul isn't in my head, it's over there. I have water now! I can go tell Jolyne everything! Your soul, you say? No matter where your intelligence lies, you're not the one making decisions here. I am the one who endowed you with a Stand ability. You filthy plankton! Don't you dare give me explanations, as if you know better than I do! My body! This water… What is streaming out of it? No, it can't be! It's steaming hot water. No aquatic organism on earth can dwell in water hotter than  degrees Celsius. A different Stand ability that turns water into hot water… …was inserted into this thing. Only I get to decide where your intellect lies. You are using your own ability to turn the water you touch into boiling hot water! Jolyne! STAND NAME: GREEN, GREEN, GREEN HOME STAND MASTER: THE GREEN BABY Where is it? Where did it fall? sh*t, don't tell me it drowned. No… Does it have a mind of its own? Since it's trying to escape? No… Instinct is its only drive. I don't know whether it's a plant or not, but I don't want it to go anywhere. I can't let Pale Snake have it. Jolyne! Wait, Jolyne! Don't move, look at the rock by your foot! Listen closely. Don't take another step. Turn around and look at me. When the pebble rolled over here, it turned into a rock. Meanwhile, Jolyne, you grew smaller. Stop! I said don't go near it! What just happened, Anastasia? Why did you grow shorter? -What's going on, Anastasia? -Stay calm, Jolyne. By the way, how big does that baby look to you? It hasn't changed. Its size is the same as before. Anastasia, it looks like you are the one who grew shorter to me. What's going on? The baby's size looks about average to me too. Only the pebble we kicked over got smaller. Jolyne, don't move. Stay right where you are. You're back to normal. Do you think that this is the baby's ability? The closer we get to the baby, the shorter we grow. I don't have a clue. That's a heavy line of questioning. Now listen, if we get halfway to the baby, my height shrinks by half. That means we have to walk twice as much. Okay. Furthermore, if we get a fourth of the way to the baby, then the distance grows by four times. At one-eighth, we walk eight times as much. /nd, /th, /th… Our body will keep shrinking, while the distance multiplies more and more. Here is the question. Will we ever reach that baby? I say no, not in an eternity. But in order to get my father's memory back, I have to get the baby. -Jolyne. -Anastasia, we'll think after we've done everything we can! It's her focus. The way Jolyne can fixate towards one goal. I'm here because I'm drawn to the way she focuses on one thing. The ability to concentrate enhances a person's beauty. Those eyes… In time, I'll have you gaze at me with that intense focus of yours. Stone Ocean! I'm about to reach it! I can catch it! It's no use, Jolyne. Pull your thread back! There is no way to reach the baby! I can't give up! There has to be an end. I mean, it's right there! What do you say to jumping off from here? If I do, I'll reach an end point. The ground is the finishing point. I have to land at some point! Stop, Jolyne! Don't-- Yes! The ground is right there! I can almost reach it! What's happening? My string… What the hell is that? Don't tell me… Is this the baby's Stand? Damn, haven't I reached the ground yet? It hasn't only grown in size, but in power as well! Its power has multiplied! This Stand… It appeared just to drag me down, so I won't ever escape this never-ending fall! Stone Ocean! If this is the baby's ability, then catching the Stand is the same as catching the User! I'm shrinking! It's trying to reduce me to nothing! The end I thought I'd reach wasn't the ground. It was this Stand! Diver Drive. The closer you get to the baby, the smaller you get. Eventually, you will be reduced to nothing. I don't know why a baby with such a powerful Stand was born, but I know he will be an enemy someday. Jolyne, this baby is your enemy. But… if there's no way to defeat it, then I really can't let Pale Snake have it. Anastasia, hold on tight! It threw the rock! Does that mean… that it's thinking for itself? The baby is now deliberately using its ability! It's coming. Climb! We need to escape as fast as possible! Run! No matter how much we chase it, we will never reach that baby. But at least, we caught the Stand. Jolyne, do you still not see what we were climbing toward? It was a gamble. The baby is intelligent and curious. Earlier, it touched the bottle I threw. When the baby chooses to touch an object, its size stays the same. In other words, the bottle's size hasn't changed. If we can't catch the baby, we'll have the baby chase after us. We finally reached the bottle. The Stand is inside the bottle now. All we have to do now is trap it inside the bottle! But… how are we getting out of here? I'm having Diver Drive enter the bottle's wall. It's bringing the mouth to us. Let's go, Jolyne. Run for it! We finally caught it. We got its User, the baby too. It's changing its position. It's using the bottle to charge forward! Anastasia! Stone Ocean! Jolyne! You can't break the bottle. We'll be worse off if we have to face the Stand! Did the baby have this in mind when it rolled the bottle? sh*t, we're in deep trouble now! -Don't break the bottle! -But… At this rate, you're done for! Anastasia, look… What the hell? What's going on? Jolyne, looks like… it's interested in the star-shaped birthmark on your left shoulder. Since it touched you, we turned back to our original size. The baby has the same birthmark on its shoulder. What's going on? The baby acts like it has known Jolyne for a long time. Hey, it looks as if it likes me. What should I do? It likes her? No, that's not it. I have no doubt about it. He will turn against us. I can only sense endless darkness from this baby's ability. Yes, we may need this baby to retrieve your father's disc from Pale Snake, but I must k*ll it while I can.
05x22 - Time for Heaven! New Moon! New Priest!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:32Hey, Pucchi… Did you know? The average number of daily visitors at the Louvre, Paris in the spring is about ,. Since its doors opened in , more than , people flock to view the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo every day. The visitors do not leave without seeing these two pieces. Isn't that incredible? Incredible? Do you mean the number of guests? That's not it. Some of the world's greatest painters and sculptors are able to express their souls in a form that can be seen by eyes. It's as if they create Stands that exist beyond time and place. Wouldn't you agree? It's an interesting thought. Does that make Leonardo Da Vinci and Alexandros of Antioch Stand Users? Yes, but I'm also talking about you. Your Pale Snake is able to extract and store souls by giving it form. Will you betray me one day? Why do you not att*ck me? You know that I would not survive in sunlight and that I lay to rest in the dark room during the day. All you have to do is finish me off while I sleep. If you turn my Stand, The World, into a disc and take it, you yourself could become king. So do it. That has never even crossed my mind. I like people who help me grow. You are the king among kings. I want to follow you and see what kind of end you will reach. I love you, in the same manner as men love their god. Sorry, that wasn't meant to insult you. It's that I've never considered that there was a man who could calm my soul just by us talking. I feared losing you. You will become a noble priest. Please, accept this. It is a symbol of my apology. I extracted it out of my body just now. No matter where you are, I will always be able to lend you my powers. EPISODE : TIME FOR HEAVEN! NEW MOON! NEW PRIEST! Jo… Jolyne! Pale Snake. Read Jolyne's whereabouts from that disc. Respond to me. What happened? Is that you there? Respond to me. Can you not hear me? Why is this transceiver here? Who is on the other end? Who? Who the hell is it? All right. I understand. The situation is that serious, huh? I just left the medical wing. Bastard! It's Weather Forecast! This rain… Where is the disc? This bastard! They had Weather Forecast summon rain! You won't escape me! Damn this rain! I can't see anything… where did they go? And it's foggy. Where is this sound of hitting rocks coming from? I think it's Morse Code? Make the fog thicker… They're after me. Pale Snake's User is Father Pucchi! He knows. He knows who I am! Weather Forecast knows! Five hundred three. Count the prime numbers. Five hundred nine. Five hundred twenty-one. Nothing can divide prime numbers. The reason why people lose… Five hundred twenty-three. Shame leads men to defeat. Men die to compensate for their shame. Five hundred forty-one. Thoughts of shameful regret such as "why did I do that earlier" weakens men and leads them to their defeat. I didn't make an error by failing to see the guards' transceiver. No, this is a trial. There are still ways to prevail. Jolyne Cujoh doesn't know who I am yet. Nothing has changed yet. I haven't completely lost them, either. True victors… are those who can reign over the circumstances given to them. It looks like you survived. Weather Forecast. Where are Jolyne and the others? Anastasia. I'm really grateful for everything you've done for me. Thanks to you, I've been safe until now. But why do you care so much about me? Finding out who Pale Snake is and getting my father's memory back is my problem, and mine only. Jolyne, how can you say that when you fully know how I feel towards you? You've already given me so much. I see a bright hope I couldn't find anywhere, inside or outside of the prison. And that's why I'm here with you. Hey, what's this? Why is it latching onto me? I'm not sure. "I'm not sure" isn't an answer. It's chewing on my hair! It's eating dirt too. So, is it actually a plant? Does it need nutrients? But it sleeps a lot too. Jolyne, get down. Something is coming. There are two of them, and they've already closed in on us. F.F.! Jolyne… I know who Pale Snake is. It's Father Pucchi, Jolyne. It was Father Pucchi all along. I almost d*ed. If Weather Forecast hadn't come, I wouldn't be alive right now. F.F.! I'm fine. I only threw out my body. What happened to you guys, Jolyne? Let me heal your right eye. What you said just now… Yes. Father Pucchi was trying to track down the baby's location from D an' G's memory. Now, we only need to corner him. There's finally a way for us to win. Weather Forecast came too. Weather Forecast. Jolyne… Have you recovered from the injuries you sustained at the factory? Yes. I hope you've been okay. What the hell is this? What are those two doing? They are embracing. I know that much! F.F., separate them! Separate them now! I have to do it? Yes, you! Remember our terms? That assh*le's smell is rubbing off on Jolyne! Calm down, it's just a greeting! See? They stopped. Stop being dramatic. We found out Pale Snake's identity. We don't have time for this petty fight. Hey, are you talking back to me? What the hell are you thinking? How dare you forget our promise. You are nothing but plankton. Jolyne, now that we know who Pale Snake is, we don't need this thing anymore. There's no use for it. Let's k*ll it. Give me permission, Jolyne. Wait a minute. It's not your ally, Jolyne. It's not even human. It didn't exist in the first place. This being is lower than animals. It should have never been born. We shouldn't keep unknown creatures like this one alive. So please, let me. Now hold on. You better watch it, Anastasia. Are you talking about me? Careful how you phrase things. Don't touch me. We don't have time for that, plankton. Weather Forecast, you know the situation, right? Give me permission. No. I cannot do that. You are the one who will die. F.F., who the hell did you bring? Bastard… f*ck, you got me. This can't be. This isn't… This can't be happening! He's not Weather Forecast. He's… He's… We were… being tricked. Thank you, F.F., for taking me here before the real Weather Forecast caught up. Five hundred forty-seven. Five hundred fifty-seven. No one can divide prime numbers. It took such a long time. I waited  years. The pinnacle of heights humans are able to achieve… This is undoubtedly it. We finally meet, you who will help me get to heaven! Though incomplete and inchoate, the only thing left for me to do is to trace the memory sealed by Jotaro Kujo. The new moon rises tonight. Dio. No other night is better suited to awaken you once again so that you benefit my cause. Thirty-six of the worst convicts' souls were absorbed and gave rise to this new life form. That's what this green creature is. That reminds me. Before I begin… I must send you to an absolute death where you are forever forgotten. Now stand, Jotaro's daughter. Though I struck a fatal blow, you managed to block a split second faster than the others. If you won't att*ck, then I will! I didn't think this was how I'd find out who you were, Pale Snake. I didn't think I'd see you again like this. I'm taking three things from you. My father's memory, the disc you took from F.F., and your life! What is the meaning of these handcuffs? You've never worn handcuffs before? I had to wear them almost every day ever since your ploy brought me here. You think you caught me with these? Do you know what handcuffs are for? They aren't to keep someone from running away. They are used to make others submit! You still don't seem to understand what you are doing right now. We are connected through these handcuffs. Do you know what that means? Let's see who is the one that's being kept here. I already turned your Stone Ocean into one of my discs. It's so close to falling out, I can almost grab it. Do you see it now? So who is the one in a predicament here, you or me? Well, I really don't get what you are on about… That's all I know. A few millimeters. A few millimeters, and this fight is over. If I can enter just a few millimeters within my range of aerial att*ck, my fist can land a blow. Some swallows die from flying directly into cliff walls. It's because their parents never taught them the safe diving range, leading the swallows to soar at a dangerous angle. It's not that the birds' parents aren't teaching their offspring. The parents cannot teach it because their own parents never taught them. This family of birds tends to have a short lifespan, and they don't even realize why they're prone to dying from accidents. Jotaro had a short lifespan. Stone Ocean is mine! I used her own disc to block her sight… How did she know where I was? Did she use the cuff's vibrations to guess? No, it's her strong will! Her strong will detected my att*ck! When she first entered prison, I thought she didn't even have a Stand ability. She seemed like a helpless little girl crying over some assh*le who used her. This is bad. Her Stone Ocean has an advantage over my Pale Snake. At this rate, I'm done for… But more importantly, the birthed creature will be destroyed! What did you throw just now? What did you do? I'm asking you what you threw! A disc is a physical manifestation of one's soul. It can be stored forever. However, what if the disc is inserted into someone on the brink of death? The disc would perish along with that person's death. That's Jotaro's memory disc you've risked your life for. You can have it back. It's stabbed into Anastasia's dying body. What will you do now? Will you go get the disc? Or will you continue your handcuff death match? It's risky to let go of Jotaro's disc, but I've already memorized the contents of the notebook. All that is left is the execution. What will you choose, Jolyne Cujoh? How can you still be contemplating? Your father is rotting away along with Anastasia as he wastes away! All that I'm after is the birthed creature. I won! As I thought, she chose her father. Spiral staircase, rhinoceros beetle, city of desolation, fig tart, rhinoceros beetle, Via Dolorosa, rhinoceros beetle, singularity point, Giotto, angels, hydrangea, rhinoceros beetle, singularity point, secret emperor. You've shown your interest. Are you willing to approach me? Will this be the beginning of everything? Now, I can depart into your world with you! Hallelujah, Dio! Anastasia! This can't be happening… No… this can't… This isn't true! Somebody! Isn't there anyone around here? Somebody! A guard! I'm right here! Please, I need a doctor! -Hey! -Diver… -Diver… Drive. -Please, somebody! -Can you hear me? -Please, call for help! -F.F… -Please! -Help! -Jolyne is mourning. This is your fault, F.F. sh*t… I'm cold. Actually, I'm freezing. Looks like my heart's already stopped b*ating. I guess her father's memory disc is inside my body. It will disappear, along with my life. I tried to eject it, but I'm fighting to stay awake. Looks like you are crumbling away. Come claim my everything. You have to be the one to do it. I'll leave my intellect for your use. You can use up all the life I have left in me too. You can have my body. So come inside my body and remove the disc for Jolyne. Only you can do it, plankton. Answer me, F.F. We made a deal! You are supposed to follow all my orders. You have to keep your word. You have to stay alive. You can mutate my body as you please. Stop wasting time! My… consciousness… It's… going… This can't be! Anastasia! No… Jolyne. It's going to be all right. It's not how it looks. You've done it. Anastasia… got the disc back for you. F.F., is that you? Are you the one speaking? One thing I feared the most was losing the ability to even think to say goodbye to my friends. But… in the final moment, I could do just that. Jolyne, please tell this to Anastasia once he wakes up. His body belongs to himself. I used his life and intellect to fill his wounds. Hold on! Why are you talking like this, F.F.? Goodbye, Jolyne. I can't be here any longer. F.F. is disappearing. What are you saying? Stop talking like that! Look at me, Jolyne. This is my soul. This is my intellect. I lived a life. I'll do anything to get your disc back from the priest. I'm talking about F.F.'s disc. That will bring you back! That must be a different F.F. I don't think it would be me. Because this is me. This is me, saying goodbye. I'm so glad I got to say my farewells… Jolyne. This is all right, Jolyne. Everything is all right. I'm glad you got your father's disc back. F.F… Respond, F.F. I've lost you, F.F. Where are you? F.F.? Answer me, F.F. F.F.
05x23 - Jail House Lock! / Lock of the Jail!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:33The first need is my Stand. My Stand, The World, and what lies beyond it are the path for men to advance further. My second need is a trustworthy friend. He must be someone who can control his desires. The desire for power, fame, money, sex… He must be free of those things. It must be someone who chooses God's laws over the laws of men. Will I, Dio, ever meet someone with this character trait? I also need at least  souls of the worst convicts. Souls of sinners have tremendous energy. I need  words. To prevent ever forgetting these words, I will etch them onto my Stand itself. I also need courage. I must have the courage to let go of my Stand just once. My decaying Stand will gather and absorb the souls of  convicts. It will then give birth to something new. The spawned creature will awaken. It will be curious about the  words spoken by the trusted friend. My friend will find me trustworthy and he will consider me his friend. Finally, I need the location. It will be north latitude,  degrees  minutes, west longitude,  degrees  minutes. Wait for the next new moon. Heaven will appear then. Good morning, Father. You've grown your hair out. When was the last time you returned home to the mainland? I have no use for this place now. The birthed creature now belongs to me. The only thing left to do is to wait for the time of heaven. EPISODE : LOCK OF THE JAIL! DISCIPLINARY WING This is the worst! How do I get out of this one? This is the highest maximum security measure ever. All the guards have g*ns too. It's too dangerous to be here with all the guards, even for just another minute. Hey, Jolyne, can you hear me? Are you listening? The priest isn't on this island anymore. He already left Green Dolphin Street. He didn't take anything, though. He wasn't carrying a baby with him! It's too boring in here. I even pierced my own belly button. Do you have my father's disc, Emporio? You got it now? Did you get in contact with the Speedwagon Foundation? I can't. The security is too tight right now. I have the disc though, Jolyne. I wouldn't put it down. Never. Good. Well, I'm getting out of here. -Lead the way. -Jolyne. The prison workers think that you are the sole survivor from the Disciplinary Wing. Though they can't pin it on you, you are the only person they can question right now. That's why this cell is under strict observation. Do you want to leave the cell and come to my room? No, Emporio. By leave, I mean getting out of this shitty prison. I don't have any more time to waste. I'm breaking out of the Green Dolphin Island. Show me the fastest way out of here. I promise I'll contact the Speedwagon Foundation. I'll even do that today. Wrong again, Emporio. This problem is much bigger than retrieving my father's disc now. If F.F. were alive, they would be going after that priest as we speak. And now that I read my father's memory, I understand what Pucchi meant by  years. I now understand why my father had to seal Dio's ability. My father would never let the priest get away. And I am Jolyne Cujoh! I have to seal what he has obtained again! Emporio. Do you plan to stay here for the rest of your life? It's up to you, but I want you to come with me. You don't understand, Jolyne. You don't get it at all. But I do. I can break out of these bars in three minutes. But what about after that? No one is left to help you. Ermes, Anastasia… They are still under treatment at the medical wing. For some reason, Weather Forecast has been holed up in his own room. He won't even come visit my room. I can leave through the Ultra Security House Unit. We got to the wetlands. We can't. No jailbreak attempt has ever succeeded. Some prisoners were detained for even contemplating a breakout. Anyway, unless you can stop time like your father, no one can ever leave this prison. I don't know what, but there's something about this place. Something more than surveillance cameras, as if the prison itself was a guard with a mind of its own. Emporio, when is the next new moon? Jolyne, please, just wait for the Speedwagon Foundation. If we risk it, we might even lose this disc we finally retrieved! North latitude,  degrees  minutes. West longitude,  degrees  minutes. Where is that? J-Jolyne… I can't help you with this. I have a message from Pale Snake. Everything is over. Don't try to leave this prison. If you stay here, we won't get in the way of you delivering the disc to Jotaro. You've got guts, I'll give you that. You showed me your face and your Stand. And what's your name? I am Mew Mew. My Stand is called Jailhouse Lock. I'm showing it to you as a warning. Did he order you to finish me off? If your plans are to break out of this jail, then yes. My plans? No, I don't have any plans. I'm leaving now! Her Stand is in the bars! I'll say it one more time, Jolyne Cujoh. Don't touch the bars. The more you think about escaping, the closer you'll be to your death. So this is what your ability does. Take this! What? Do you need me to get someone? Are you okay, Jolyne? Where am I? Why am I here? It's you, Gwess. Am I in the female wing? It hurts! "One, grab a pen as soon as you can." "Two, you can only retain up to three new pieces of information." "Three, defeat the User." "Her name is Mew Mew." What are these writings and who wrote them? Did someone write these while I was asleep? . GO SEE EMPORIO Oh, that's right. I was locked up because of what happened at the Ultra Security House Unit. I gave myself a belly piercing. Then, I ran into Emporio. I told him I'm getting out of here to go after the priest. And then, after that… After that… I… What? After I said I was leaving, I remember someone coming. But who was it? This is my handwriting. Did I write these? No way. When did I write them, though? I don't even remember writing them. Tell me, why am I back here in the female wing? Hey! Answer me! Why are you ignoring me? I must've been sleeping since I don't remember. I'm serious! Oh, also, do you have a pen? I need a pen. Give me one. Hey, you… I'm really serious. Do you think I wrote these on myself? That I wrote on my own body? . YOU CAN ONLY RETAIN UP TO THREE NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION Hey, Gwess… be honest. Have I been asking you the same question over and over again? Can you do me a favor? Can you tell me all the things I've asked you already? "Jolyne, the prison doctor has diagnosed you with temporary amnesia brought on by a great shock you received while in the Hole." "You can only memorize up to three things at a time." "You can still remember the past, but if you memorize a fourth new thing, you will forget one." "However, since this will not affect your life as a prisoner, you were sent back to the female wing two days ago." Two days? I've been here that long? Get better soon, Jolyne. For two days… Have I been repeating the same questions for two whole days? But why? "Defeat the User." "Her name is Mew Mew." This is… Could this be… No, it can't be… It's a Stand ability! They're trying to keep me locked up in here! I'm under att*ck! I remember seeing Emporio. And then… After that… After that… Let's see… I remember something happening. WASH YOUR HANDS DON'T FORGET TO WEAR YOUR PANTIES sh*t! What the hell? By the way, Gwess, do you know anyone named Mew Mew? You haven't asked that yet, Jolyne. Her prisoner cell is upstairs. I think she has ratty, blond hair. She's about your height. I don't know why she's here, but I bet she was whoring around. Where do I go to see her? She was here until a moment ago, Jolyne. She just walked by. Can you tell me how she looks like again? She's about cm. Her hair is platinum blonde and it's ratty. She wears fishnets. This is the female wing. How did I get back here? Who's Mew Mew? What's the matter? No… You just said you wanted lunch. It's almost lunchtime. Is that right? Don't think about getting out of here, Jolyne Cujoh. You can't att*ck me and my Jailhouse Lock, ever. STAND NAME: STONE OCEAN STAND MASTER: JOLYNE CUJOH Pale Snake was the priest. F.F. figured it out for us. And then…. They d*ed, didn't they? Bottoms up. I'll avenge you. Hey! Why are you grabbing food? Give me your ticket first. I'm here to grab the packed lunch. Like I said, ticket first. You won't be sneaking one away. Now show it to me. Stop taking forever. If you don't have it, then leave. Now scram. Next. Did I leave it next to my bed? I've got to write it somewhere so I don't forget it. LEAVE FOOD TICKET IN HERE What? Why am I here again? Oh, why did I come back up here? I can't remember a thing. Why did I come back up here? Hey Jolyne, that's my lunch! You ate a good bit of it! You ate my favorite cheese penne! You left your ticket in your pocket, remember? Sorry. I'll get you another one with my ticket. No, it's fine. Just stop. I can get it, just give me your ticket. Can you write it down somewhere that I have your ticket? Oh, sorry. I GAVE MY FOOD TICKET TO GWESS What's this, a User? Is it referring to a Stand? Oh, that's right. I have to go see Emporio. I tried to break out of the confinement cell. Emporio must have been with me then. Emporio might know something. And I need to get out of here. I GAVE MY FOOD TICKET TO GWESS Hey, I said the mustard's out! There's not a squeeze left in here. Do you have another bottle? Why does it feel like I'm always eating the same food? I don't have an appetite. I'll just eat the cheese penne. Can I sit with you, Jolyne? I'm sitting down here. I stepped on a cockroach earlier. It was so gross. Who is she? She seems to know me. Blonde… Ratty hair… Fishnet tights. What the hell did you do that for? Do you want mustard? What about ketchup? You aren't fond of dressing, are you? It's pretty good. Thanks. By the way, what's your name? Oh, no. I'm so sorry, I spilled it on you! Let's get you clean. Your arm got drenched. We need to go clean it off. Take that jacket off. . YOU CAN ONLY RETAIN UP TO THREE NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION Oh, that's so much better. There, all squeaky clean! Let's check your pocket too. That's a gift from me. Jailhouse Lock. Anyone who touches the cell bars with my Stand in it to try and escape can then only remember three pieces of information. Their life is then restricted by the three memories. It's worse than not having any memories at all. They experience over and over again that everything they do is meaningless. Eventually, this cycle of failure becomes etched in their bodies. They then lose all drive to escape. You can even say that they are crippled. This is what you get for trying to break out. What do I need to do? What's important to me? What shouldn't I forget? That's all I need to get out of this trap. I just need one thing! I need to recall it now. If I don't recall it right this minute, I'll forget it forever! Just one thing! What matters to me? GO SEE EMPORIO This is all I need. I'll leave one memory open. These two things. These two things are all I need. The rest, I don't need. I need to leave this place! I spilled… my water. I need to… unplug the power. The power is shorting out. Or else, I can't leave out of that exit to go see Jolyne. I have things I need to tell Jolyne! I can't forget them! I have to leave this room! I spilled my water. MEMORY ONE: I SPILLED MY WATER I need to… unplug the power. MEMORY TWO: I NEED TO UNPLUG THE POWER The power is shorting out. MEMORY THREE: THE POWER IS SHORTING Or else, I can't leave out of that exit… MEMORY FOUR: OR ELSE, I CAN'T LEAVE THIS ROOM TO GO SEE JOLYNE MEMORY THREE …to go see Jolyne. Wait a second. "Go see Emporio"? I'm sure I read that name on her arm. I need to go make sure. No one can escape this place. GO SEE EMPORIO
05x24 - Jailbreak...QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:33North latitude,  degrees  minutes, west longitude,  degrees  minutes. Wait for the next new moon. Heaven will appear then. I have no use for this place now. The birthed creature now belongs to me. Jailhouse Lock. You can only remember three new pieces of information. What do I need to do? What's important to me? What shouldn't I forget? I have things I need to tell Jolyne! What am I doing here? Something's off. What? Why is this man going inside the house? I have no idea what's going on. Bitch! Stop rewinding it so much! No sh*t, now I'm lost too! Get this bitch out of here! Fine, I'll leave. Greenie, that's the head honcho of all the other spiders in this cell. Hello sir, great to meet you. I'm Pit Viper Ron. Yes, good to meet you. And this spider right here's about to croak. Oh, hey. The hell? What's funny about it? I don't get this comic at all. Oh, why did I come to this recreation room? . YOU CAN ONLY RETAIN UP TO THREE NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION That's right… I'm in a predicament. I came here to find a way out of this situation. The medical wing is beyond this corridor. The stairs on the way lead to Emporio's room. It's usually not a hassle, but the area is heavily guarded today. How can I reach Emporio? IF ANYONE KEEPS LOOKING AT MY LEFT HAND, DON'T HESITATE JUST PUNCH She has a Stand! It looks familiar too. I have to chase it. She's my enemy! She's the Stand User! EPISODE : JAILBREAK… Where… am I? And who was I trying to chase just now? There she is. -Target found at the corner of D--. -Hands in the air! I was wrong, I'm the one being chased! She's right there! Hey, don't move! What the… Was there just one guard coming from this way? No, that doesn't matter right now. Where is this? Where the hell am I? Why am I being chased? Where is she? I swear she ran this way! Keep looking. We have to find her! There's no way we lost her. She must be hiding somewhere close! She may have ran towards the stairs. That's not possible. She would have to walk right past us. Stairs? "Go see Emporio…" That's right, that flight of stairs leads to Emporio's room. What's going on? That's right, I spilled some water. GO TELL JOLYNE I have to tell Jolyne. I have to print something. We'll end up forgetting it, so I have to show her the guard's face. Or else, I can't tell her. MEW MEW, AGE  LEAD GUARD Jolyne Cujoh. You can't retain more than three new pieces of information. Even if you saw four guards, you can't remember more than three of them. Even though the fourth guard is in your line of sight, your brain rejects it since that's too much to remember. You wanted to go see Emporio, so I let you guide me here. So I see. I didn't know there was a room here. Emporio! Jolyne. -How long have you been here? -I got here just now. Your poor hands. What happened to them? The writings on your arms… You can only remember three new things. You're in the same boat as I am! Ever since that time in the confinement cell! That's right, I was hoping to see you. I have to tell you something, Jolyne! What's this? What was I doing just now? What? Jolyne? When did you get here? -And why did you come? -Right, why am I here? -Why? -Why? Oh, that's right. I'm here to see you. I don't know what for, but there was a really serious reason for me to come see you. Print it out. I have to print something out. If I don't, it'll be forgotten forever. Printing is the only way to remember it. Print what out, Emporio? What are you talking about? Huh? But how would I do that? What was I trying to print out? "Mew Mew, Lead Guard." It makes sense now. So he was with you when my Stand activated. He had seen my face and heard me say my name. Emporio was hiding in the walls of the confinement cell. Usually, I'd let him be. My Jailhouse Lock's job is to keep Stand Users behind bars. But if he's trying to leave a record of me, then that changes everything. I now deem you an escapee. Her Stand, Stone Ocean. b*ll*ts won't give her a scratch. But her memory would have been impaired had I fired four sh*ts. Her brain wouldn't even register the fourth sh*t, let alone the smoke from it! Jolyne… What? I don't know why there's a room in a place like this, and what a little boy is doing here. But Pale Snake had told me that Jolyne Cujoh has allies from the inside who have been helping her -using walkie-talkies and the like. -Emporio! So this little boy was her ally. And now, any record he had about me is gone. I won't forgive you! Wow, how caring. But even that anger you feel right now will be completely forgotten with the next three pieces of information. That's my Stand Jailhouse Lock's ability. Take this. Meet your end, Jolyne Cujoh! You won't be able to see more than three of the sh*ts. The others will leave a hole in your body! An image reflected on water is the one whole truth. You might be able to sh**t many sh*ts at once, but I can see their reflections all at once. I hope you haven't forgotten about this one. AVENGE EMPORIO That bitch… But I managed to destroy the computer. Now, I just have to escape. Jolyne will forget about me soon anyway. She will never be able to remember who I am! Emporio, hang in there for just a bit longer. I will go after her. Don't, Jolyne. You'll forget everything the moment you step out of this room. You'll even forget about defeating her. So, please… Emporio, I understand why you are so careful. It was a skill you needed to develop to survive inside these prison walls. But there comes a time when we have to move forward, even if that means facing danger. And for me, that time is now! Is this her string? STAND NAME: JAILHOUSE LOCK STAND USER: MEW MEW Why am I injured? But there comes a time when we have to move forward, even if that means facing danger. I don't know why… but I feel like there's something I have to do… What was it? That's right, print it out. I have to tell Jolyne. I have to print something out… but what was I trying to print? My room doesn't even have a printer. COMPUTE She's strong! She is the enemy I'm after. I can't let her get away. I need you back here! I'm at the D stairwell! Look, she's over there! Lead Guard Mew Mew is being assaulted! The gate! Open the gate! This place… Why am I here? Hurry! Capture her! Am I… being chased? The three guards are here now. Now, you will never recall that I exist! Now, try to run away just a little bit. Then, the guards will sh**t you to death. Before you go, those hands of yours… I almost forgot that they can block g*nshots. My duty is strictly to keep Stand Users confined in this facility. But I feel great right now. It feels great to watch you get sh*t to death. Because you brought this upon yourself. You wanted to walk out of your line, so this is what you get. There she is. And I love that you can't see more than three guards! -I've found her! -There she is! No one can escape my Jailhouse Lock! Jolyne… How long have you been here? Emporio, it's you! I have to tell you… I have to print this out for you. If I don't, you won't be able to remember her. Print it out? Binaries. These are binaries made up of ones and zeroes. I must have computed this. You can print it correctly. We are going to imprint it into your memory! Stone Ocean! They're binary numbers. The binary system can express anything. Draw zeroes and ones using your thread. You can use Stone Ocean as a printer that can express images! Can I consider you my enemy? Are you an enemy? What? She's talking nonsense. She can't even see me. Now, be gone. Thanks. So I guess you are an enemy after all. What's happening? She has Mew Mew hostage! Emporio. Her Jailhouse Lock is no longer active. Yes. I'm okay now. Great. I'm leaving now. Like I told you before, I'm leaving this prison. What are you going to do? If you plan on staying here, then you should go back to your room. Jolyne, my time to leave is now. I… I want to see the outside world! Look, a child. Why is there a child in prison? Either way, keep your guard up! Come, Emporio. Let's go. Excuse me. Sorry, coming through. Sorry, excuse me. What? Who was I trying to g*n down? -What am I doing here? -Why am I here? Great job, Mew Mew. I'm glad you understand. First, we are going to the medical wing to treat Emporio's wound. I'm counting on you to keep us safe, Jailhouse Lock. An undefeated ability that restricts the enemy's memory. Where… am I? Do you have my father's disc? Yes. I've had it with me the entire time. Hey, Jolyne! It's Jolyne. Emporio, you too. Ermes. I heard a commotion. I knew it had to be you guys. Who is she? She is this prison's lead guard. What? Does that mean you're… Yes. We are breaking out. We're about to leave this place. You're going after that priest. That's right, Ermes. I have to seal what he took. I'm ready for anything. Things even worse than what we faced in this prison. Take me with you then. Father, thank you. I don't mean to be rude, but are you feeling okay? Yes, I'm just a little tired. Are you… sure? Excuse me. What is this? What's wrong with these eggs? A Stand… Pale Snake is no longer my Stand ability. Something else is inside me… but what? I feel terrible… Something is running loose inside me. This power, it's beyond my control. But this power carries hope. I can at least feel hope within this power. Dio's memo inside Jotaro's memory… It seems this power needs the things in that memory. Time and place. North latitude,  degrees  minutes. West longitude,  degrees  minutes. That's where heaven will be. This location is Cape Canaveral. Kennedy Space Center. It will be during the new moon. Six more days.

But now that we're out…   -It was…-It was…   -the shittiest place ever.-the shittiest place ever.   That's a gas station.   And that's a bus stop!   Are we riding a bus?   I've never been on a bus before.   We're escaped convicts.   We're bound to get caughtif we hop on a bus.   But we can't exactly track downthe priest on foot.   First, we need to securea means of transportation.   EPISODE   : Bohemian Rhapsody ( )   What did you say?   Weather Report.   Jolyne is no longer   in the prison's Female Wardnor the solitary cells.   I can tell by the shift in the air.   It must mean that she managed to escape.   Hold on a second.   A star-shaped birthmark.   What exactly are you?   I saw the same birthmark   on the back of The Green Baby's neck.   And I've heard that Jolyne's fatheralso has the same mark.   If you can't recall, then surmise.   How did you end up at Green Dolphin?   You say you don't have any memories,   but doesn't that meanthe priest took your memory disc?   One thing is for certain. He's our enemy.   I will break out, track the man,and defeat him to learn the truth.   What will you do?   Two convicts have escapedThe Green Dolphin Street State Prison.   The convicts' names areJolyne Cujoh and Ermes Costello.   We have released their photosand are seeking information.   Jolyne got past Mew Mew's Stand,   and is now coming after me.   The hell? Why won't my car start?   Got plenty of gas in the t*nk.This has never happened before.   I've never missed a maintenance check.   Sorry, Father.   We're nowhere near your destination,but it's as far as we can go.   I'll radio for another cab.   No, here is fine. I'm not in a hurry.   I've felt ill since I took on my new form.   Five days remainuntil the next new moon rises.   I must keep them away,   whether it's Jolyne or someone else.   Hurry, he's in cardiac arrest!   He's a robber.The police sh*t him in the leg.   He then jumped offthe sixth floor of the building!   This one's a biker g*ng member,   speeding on the wrong side of the roadand lost control!   What the hell is with tonight?   This one's a drug addict. He's in shock!   Stay back, bastards!   The drug addict woke up!   sh*t, he's stabbing his hostage!   Put your g*n down!

Where did you come from?   You don't know what you are, do you?   He stabbed the hostage!   That wasn't…   No, it wasn't you,but these scissors are positioned   a mere millimeter awayfrom severing my nerves.   This is a coincidence.   It just so happened to s*ab mein a way that isn't fatal.   What will you do? It's all in your hands.   Will you move the scissorsever so slightly?   Before you decide,do you believe in gravity?   There's a gravitational forcethat draws one person to another.   I have become a believerin this very moment.   You cannot k*ll me.   You are here becauseyou were drawn in by my pull.

A gravitational pull    draws one person to another.    Ouch.    My, thank you.    It's nothing serious.    It's just an old knee injurythat aches when it rains.    Your knee aches when it rains.    Yes, that's right.    Thank you, son.    Don't get into people's business.    Our backs may no longer haveThe Green Dolphin logo,    but our jailbreak is all over the news.    We must find a car andgain distance immediately.    No stolen cars.    The authorities will be able totrack a stolen vehicle.    It will only interfere withfinding the priest.    So what, you want to take the bus?    Are we going to wait at the bus stop?    Hey, you two.    Are you taking the bus?    The next bus is an hour away.    How about you hop onto my truck?    If you don't mindsitting in the bed, that is.    You were very kind to me,    so I feel very good right now.    Even the pain in my knee is gone.    I've never felt better.

I sense that for sure.    North. We must head north.    There's a famous theme parkin a city up north.    Have you ever been?    That's right, you can't remember.    There's one characterwho's especially famous at the park.    Maybe even you'd recognize him…    What a joke.    None of the characters are printed!    Watch out! We're not alone.    Could it be an enemy?    Diver Down!    Got it!    Anasui, there's more than one.    Either way, I caught one of them.    What the hell is it?    Search, Weather Report.The Stand User must be nearby.    I doubt it's this old man.    He has no reason to stage a happenstance    just to close in on us.    Then someone else must be close by.    Just as you felt Jolyne's movements,the priest must sense yours.    He could be sending enemies after us.    What are you? Spill it!    You don't want to do that.    It's in your best interest to not hurt me.    Children around the world will weep!    The hell was that?    Can't breathe…    Can you not choke me like that? I mean it.    There's one more of you here.Do you work in pairs?    N-No, it's just me.    Oh, no! Sorry, my bad!    I didn't mean to hurt you.    Little punk!    My nose grows on its own.    It's a reflex thing!    When I lie, my nose grows.    Sorry, I lied just now.    I mean, it wasn't totally a lie.    Well, I don't work in a pair,but I'm not exactly alone either.    That's right.    Oh, see that? I was telling the truth.    My nose shrank back!    -Ouch.-What the hell are you?    Please don't be so rough.    I'm speaking for myself here,but I'm a good guy.

The bite she took is justlodged in her throat.    She didn't digest the thing.    Who eats an applefrom a random old lady, anyway?    We're even wary aboutValentine's day chocolates.    She's so naive!It makes us want to protect her.    How many are there on this truck?There's so many of them, Weather!    Calm down. There's no need to panic.    What did you like as a child?Did you have a favorite character?    I bet it was me.    I'm a fan of the T-     seriesfrom The Terminator,    not that it's with us.    We love Chewbacca.    Not to mention The Elephant Man!    But Snow White is the best of all!    -Heigh-ho!-Heigh-ho!

Old man, stop the car!    -What?-What's wrong, Weather?    I said, hit the brakes!    Oh good heavens.    -How sickening!-This is terrible! Everyone, come look!    Old man, stop! Stop the car!

Way back when you were little.    sh*t!    I'll get run over by the tires!    Weather, get him to stop the car!    This can't be happening.    sh*t, we won't make it!    Weather Report made airbags.    Are you hurt?How did you fall out like that?    It must have been a Stand att*ck,    but I wonder why it only targeted you.    Maybe it's gotsomething to do with the fact    that I don't recognize Pinocchio.    Hey Weather!    Am I invisible to you?    Is that me on the ground?    Are you all safe?    -Woo-hoo!-Woo-hoo!    Where's the princess?    Is she okay?    She got thrown towards the burger shop.Let's go get her!    Look up! Do you recognize them?    I know of them! But we aren't friends.    They're Japanese!So sleek! Such show-offs!    Fictional characters are broughtinto the real world.    Not only that,    they have the ability tosplit our minds from our bodies.    That's what this is all about, isn't it!    If you're a Stand,tell me where your User is!    I don't know.    I really don't know a thing.    I'm just Pinocchio.    But who cares?    You can be a hero in a fantasy.    Isn't it wonderful?    Your mind split off becauseit wants to be a part of our world.    A world where everyone longs to be,    Bohemian Rhapsody.    It's a capriccio of the free!    Cut the nonsense, or else,this is what you'll get.    What are you doing?How could you do this to me?    All children around the worldare my friends!    This is not how the story goes!    Weather is gone.    I need to stay with himand my body right now.    Please wait.    Don't go.    Sorry, old man. That crash was on you.I'm taking off.

It's a duster.    Let me repay you by dusting you off.    Is everything okay?Your mouth is split to your ears.    Yes, it's to swallow you whole,Little Red Riding Hood!    Diver Down!    And that's how the story goes.    Did he just say "story"?    Weather!    Pinocchio and the dwarvesdidn't seem to be Stands.    The User and the Standare in separate places,    bringing the characters to life.    To the north. I feel the presence.    The User and its Stand are not far away.    Pinocchio is only the start.    We must get rid of the User.    Weather!    Can't you hear me?
05x26 - Bohemian Rhapsody (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:35Something's off. I don't like this.  The enemy has activated a Stand.  I can feel its presence.  But our enemy isn't in this city.  I can feel it moving farther away.  If it wanted to att*ck us,  its presence should beapproaching us instead.  What is going on?  There's my body!   The enemy first wants to k*ll my body,which is vulnerable without my Stand.   I have to protect my body!   What's this?   Oh! It's Batman!   I found Batman! Awesome!

Did they just say "story?"   How could you be so cruel?   How could youdevour my brothers like that?   What is this creature?   I thought that was chocolateI injected into my face.   Are they goats, or are they chocolate?   "He's a cunning little devil."   "He tricked the seven kidsinto opening the door and came inside."   "And then, he cornered the kidsone by one and gobbled them up!"   "The only one that survived   was the youngest kid,who hid inside the grandfather clock!"   I know this story!   "When the mother goat came home,she grew very upset!"   "The mother held the scissorsin her cloven hoof,   and went a one, a two at his stomach."   "She took out his guts andstuffed pebbles in his body."   "Then he got thrown into a pond!"   Don't read such a story!   The villain was a wolf!   The wolf came and ate my brothers!   The enemy Stand wasn't goingafter my body.   I was being dragged into   a story!   Excuse me.   Is this the way tothe hospital in Saint-Rémy?   Ask someone else.   Oh? Excuse me.   Wait, I believe you know me.   Sorry, but I can't help you.   I'm not from here.   Never mind that.   Aren't you my fan?   I can tell from your face.You've been inspired by me.    My name    is Van Gogh.I am Van Gogh's self-portrait.    Yesterday, I cut off my ear with a razor.    See, you were moved by me again.    Mommy's coming back with scissors!    Our mommy's going to get you!    Bad wolf!    Bring it, fucker!    Mommy! We're over here!    We're trapped in here!    What the hell?    Save us!    How dare you!    How could you eat my babies?    Continuing reporton the fantasy hero incident.    The incident is believed to havestarted in Florida, USA, a few hours ago.    Not only are cartoonand story characters brought to life,    but even figures from artworksare being sighted.    The riches of all humanity,    the treasures for our souls    are vanishing!    This User doesn't care aboutcausing chaos around the world.    Their only objectiveis to keep the priest safe.    The Stand itself is invincible.    The only way to win is to strike the User!    The User is headed north. I can sense it.    It's moving at a pretty fast pace.    It's getting farther away from here!    Here's a question.    How many self-portraits did I paint,    before my untimely death?    Back off, or I'll kick you!    The answer is about   .    Van Gogh left that many self-portraits.    It was before I cut off an ear.    Then I ended my    years of life,    k*lling myself with a g*n!    I see you are one of my self-portraits.    Hello, Van Gogh with a severed ear.    What?    Van Gogh sh*t himself in the head twice.    A single b*llet wasn't enoughto end his life.    That's right. He needed to sh**t himselftwice to seal the deal.    This enemy!    Weather Report!    Direction is north.    Shut down the highway with a rainstorm,up to    kilometers north!    Don't let a single car head north!    Diver Down restructured the doorfrom the inside.    It's been fused with the wall.Nothing can open this door now!    Diver Down!    My brothers are free!    And that's how the story goes!    Once a story begins,nothing can alter its course.    I'm powerless against this Stand!    The walls, Diver Down!    Submerge!    Hell yes, I'm safe.    Officers from earlier.    So their souls have also splitfrom their bodies.    Anyhow, I'm taking this police car…    -Pebbles! Get the pebbles!-Mommy!    I can't escape.Weather, hurry and k*ll the User!    I sensed the enemy up north,    but now it's down south.    No way…    Is it in the air?    Flight     , destination Key West.    Despite the sudden downpour,    we were able to depart on time.    This ability that recently awakenedwithin me.    I can only be defeated ifI'm in direct harm's way    Nothing can touch me whenI'm high up in the air.    I'm finally living my life to the fullest.    This power keeps my blood racing.    THE NIGHT BEFORE    To be born    means to be chosen.    Once one is chosen,    one is protected and supported by all.    Amidst the competitions of life,    the chosen one rises above.    Those who were drawn to me.    They exist to bring me to heavenwhen the rightful time arrives.    Yes, Jolyne Cujoh may have escapedto chase me down,    but she merely existsto help me attain heaven.    Sons of Dio,    help me get to Cape Canaveral.    This act will beyour singular source of joy.    All my life,    I felt like a tumbling rockthat rolls without a purpose.    But now I understand.    I was born to use my ability!    I'll do whatever it takesto protect the priest.    Also, Bohemian Rhapsody is magnificent!    It makes me laugh to watchsociety fall into utter darkness.    The very society that despised me!    No, I can't catch up.    If the Stand User is on an airplane,    its speed exceeds    kph.    Even the largest hurricane on record    cannot travel faster than    kph.    There's not a single weather phenomenonthat can catch up to an airplane.    It got away!    One more b*llet.    If I take one more b*llet,    this story will end.    Dammit!    Don't you dare get close to that g*n.    If you touch it, I'll k*ll you!    Anasui!    Weather.    What?    Weather!    Yes! The wolf is drowned!    -And that's how the story goes!-Hurray!

What are you reading? Let me see.    I can't breathe!    You want me to do more?    No, this is fine. Thanks.    You've got real talent.    What's with the drawing, Weather?    I got this Van Gogh to draw,    and create a new character.    He comes with a story of his own.    This hero can use an ability.    It sucks all the fantasy heroesback into their stories!    This hero's story will end    once its ability restores orderto our reality!    We're going back,and that's how the story goes.    We will now rejoin our unharmed bodies!    Hey, are you listening?    Can I have my book back?    Breaking news.    Order has been restored.    Characters from story books,cartoons, movies, and artwork    are back where they belong.    This includes Mona Lisa, Snow White,Batman, and Tweety.    However, for some unknown reason,Pinocchio is still missing.    Did you fall asleep?    Was it too boring?    But this story is fullof hopes and dreams.    UNGALOSTAND NAME: Bohemian Rhapsody    BACK TO DESPAIRBEYOND RECOVERY    Hey, what do you drive now?    I hope    you got rid of that one, Romeo.    Jolyne!    Please. Help me, Jolyne!    -Do you know what a "plea deal" is?-…you will be sent to Green Dolphin…    Romeo!    You…    How did you…    Let me warn you, Romeo.    Stay away from the phone.    All phones.    Got that?    That's the last thing on my mind.    Ever since that day, I've felt so sorry.    I realized my own foolishness    only after I lost you.    Oh, god.    How can I ever make upfor what I've done to you--    There's no need for words, Romeo.    You are the best I ever had.    I need you.    I tried to go visit you,but they wouldn't let me.    Romeo, you poor boy.    I really pity you.    Nothing matters anymore    about the hit-and-run.    I have nothing against you.    After all, you got embroiledin a conspiracy.    Romeo, I came to ask you for a favor.    I need money and a car.    I have to go somewhere.    I only have a thousand dollars on me.    Take these keys.    This is plenty. Thank you, Romeo.    Just don't talk if the police come.    Promise me.    Oh, Jolyne,    I will confess my crimes.    I'll get you a non-guilty verdict.    So please, come back to me!    Wow, car keys!    Hello? I'm Romeo Jisso,a Palm Beach resident.    Is this the police?    I'm reporting an escaped convict.    Yes, it's Jolyne Cujoh.    I knew it.    It was wise that you used my stickerto make a copy of his tongue.    This assh*le is already ratting you out.    No, she didn't!    She didn't come to my house.Why would she?    I'm filing a report because she called.    Yes, we only talked over the phone.    She asked for moneybut I didn't give her any.    She said she's headed to Mexico.    Of course, I will make another callif she contacts me again.    Yes. Bye.    I'm impressed.    He kept his word.    I will do anything for her.    Anything to atone for my actions.    Jolyne!    Wow, your ex-boyfriend is awesome!    Guess what the key is for?    He gave us car keys too, but guess what?    Look over there!    Can we ride it?    I want to try piloting it.    I bet it's totally differentfrom reading about it in a book!    Romeo, I stand corrected.    But let's rip this off. For good measure.    Let's get going.    The helicopter will get us therein a matter of hours.    Father,    I understand my assignment to protect you.    Can you do somethingabout my eyelid first?    One of my eyelids    always slides down for no reason.    I can't open my eye.    I mean, I can get it to open sometimes.
05x27 - Sky HighQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:36Wow, so this is auto-pilot mode.I'm getting the hang of it.  Don't get carried away.Didn't you read that helicopters crash?  Emporio, head west. We need to go west.  Why? At this rate, we'll bein Cape Canaveral in    minutes.  It's the priest's presence.  For some reason,it's now in three to four locations.  It's just west.  I have no doubt thathe is close to Orlando.  -I feel strange.-What?   Ermes, my eye feels weird.   My eyelids! They're closing!   Jolyne, something is off!   What?   My eyelids!   My eyes won't open!   What's going on, Ermes?   What is happening?   I don't know!   But something else is here!   Dammit…   EPISODE   : Sky High   Emporio, control the helicopter!   I'm trying to put it back in auto-pilot!   We're under att*ck.   What did it do to us?   Hurry! We're tilting down to the right!   I can't see anything!My eyelids won't budge!   There's definitely something in here!   Are you sure?My web of strings can't detect it.   Yeah! It slid in through the window.   It moves quickly so I didn't notice.   sh*t. Its speed wouldn't be a problemif we can figure out its position!   Can you get rid of itif we learn its position?   If we knew its direction of speed?   Yeah, I'm certain of it.   All right.   Ermes,   how fast are we going right now?   Is it    kph? Or    kph?   What?   We're ditching this ride. Emporio!   What?   You're crazy, Jolyne!   We won't survive this height!   I can see it now!Yes, I can read where it is!   I got it! I smashed it!   That wasn't the only one!   Ermes, we can't drop any lower. Hang on!   Emporio, are you okay?   I can open my eyes.   I can see again.   What happened?   Don't let your guard down.They're not through with us.   There were dozens of them!   Also, they're not Stands.They're living organisms!   What are these things?   So the enemy Stand Usercan control these creatures?   Wait, I've seen it somewhere.   Until now,   I couldn't even drive a car.   But recently, I'm learning to focus.   I have enough focus to sh**t downa helicopter out of the air.   I have no doubt.   He is one of the presences I sensed.   You must be the priest's ally.   Rikiel,   think of the man named Dio.   ORLANDO STATE HOSPITAL   Think of your bloodline,   sons who have never known your father.   Both of my eyelids   close shut out of the blue.   I always get like this.   I went to the doctor,   but there's nothingphysically wrong with me.   That's all they ever say.   I was    when it started.   I was taking my end-of-year exam.   Suddenly, I couldn't breathe.   The people around me   either pitied or ignored me.   That made me sweat even more.   That was the last time I went to school.   I can't see! My eyelids! I can't breathe!   Goodness, my hands and foreheadare covered in sweat!   This happens when I get overwhelmed.   Rikiel.   I don't have an ability!   I'm a good-for-nothing!   But you do. I see it in you.   You happened to never come around to it.   Have you heard of creatures called "rods"?   They are also known as "skyfish."   They are cryptids.   Not much is known about them,and their corpses are rarely found.   TV crews have attemptedto capture them in the past,   but failed due to their insane speed.   They're too fast for the naked eye,   thus have only been seen on video footage.    I looked into your ability disc.    I found out that these rods    have a habitat here in Florida.    Are you talking about them, Father?    I saw them. Just now!    My eyes are open!    Can I control these creatures,and that's my ability?    Did one of them touch me just now?    No, it didn't. However…    Rods were around me all this time.    Now get going, Rikiel.    Starting today, your Stand abilityshall be known as Sky High.    Learn about the rods' mechanisms    and use them to your advantage.    Leave it to me. I feel like I'm reborn.    I'm no longer a mutt panting for air.    "Rods"?    Yeah. If these are rods,    we can unravel its mechanismby finding out their sustenance.    No one knows what they feed on.    Rods are able to fly aroundwithout colliding into objects.    The secret lies in their sustenance!    Emporio, stay back.    Come closer,    Jolyne Cujoh and Ermes.    For the rods' att*ckto deal precise damage,    I'll just wait for them to close in…    Hey, don't get too close to him.    We have to learn moreabout his ability first.    He was willing to expose himself    because the closer he is,the more precise his att*cks are.    He also chose a confined spacelike the helicopter,    because att*cks in an open fieldwon't be precise.    Calm down.    The range of their Standsis less than two meters.    They can't strikeunless they're close, either.     Dammit!    I parked my bike on mud.    I have to rev it up andmove it to more solid ground.    Where's my key? Where'd I put it?    The rocks made a curve!    He didn't even try to deflect the throw!    Yeah, I have no idea how that happened.    But Emporio,    the rocks didn't change their course.    One more!    I can't breathe!    My eyelid, it's twitching!    There they are, Ermes.I can see them clearly.    They're flying all around!    The rods are suspended in air!    He's having a panic att*ck    and is losing control over his ability!    Turns out you're hereto get a good b*ating!    There it is! I never took the key out!    My hand!    It was July     .    Neil Armstrong made historyas the first man to walk on the moon    on the Apollo    mission.    I never understood its significance.    It's engineers and scientistswho fly rockets to space.    Even monkeys can become astronauts.    But the first timeI fully caught sight of rods,    it finally dawned on me.    The first step on the moonwas made by humanity's willpower.    On that same day,humanity left the earth and evolved.    Mental evolution is invaluable!    My hand! It's rotting away!    It's bloody! My pee is bloody!    I can't feel my legs!    What the hell did you do?    You choose to stand in the wayof the priest's evolution.    My hatred burns hotter than tempered iron,    and I choose to eliminate you all!    STAND NAME: Sky HighSTAND MASTER: RIKIEL    Jolyne Cujoh.    You're next,but I'll finish you all at once.    He targets the inside of our bodies.    Unless the att*ck is internal,    a physical blow wouldn'ttwist her up like that.    The inside of our bodies?    This imprint!    I'm starting to understand.    Jolyne, our body heat!    Rods feed on our body heat!    Bloody urine is caused by kidney damage.    Jotaro's disc kept one kidney safe,    but the other side is cool to touchfrom losing body heat!    When I was at the ghost room,    I read something from a bookon the second row of the shelf.    A damaged body part    is colder than the rest of the body.    If your hand is robbed of heat,    the fingers curl and eventually rot.    Chill the eyelids and they droop.    Chill just one kidney,    and blood enters the urine stream.    The rods,    they convert body heat from othersinto their own energy!    They come close, but they never touch.    You don't realize what they've done,    until an illness takes a toll on you.    You little know-it-all.    He's right,    but I don't cause the illness to k*ll you.    I only meant to immobilize.    To strike you on a specific body part,that is!    Cooling this certain body part is fatal.    The body part which controlseach and every organism.    It's the brain stem!    I will now steal your body heatfrom your first vertebra.    Now, strike!    Jolyne, the water!Get your head under water.    No, Emporio. Give me your lighter.    The ghost lighter.    Give it to me.    This is too reckless!    This is nothing    compared to everything elsewe've been through.    Compared to finding that priest,    this is nothing.    This bitch!    I'm mentally stronger than her.    Where?    Find it,    find a target to finish her off!    -What the…-She got him!    A star-shaped birthmark.    I don't know who you are,    but I guess you can tell usabout the priest.    After we give you a good b*ating, that is.    Think of your bloodline.    That's right, I've changed.    No.    Rods cannot focus on one body part    when the target is covered in flames.    But if I'm also covered in flames,    I would know exactly.    I can find your vulnerable spot    through my own senses.    My heart soars like Apollo   .    Jolyne Cujoh, I will surpass you!    Jolyne, hurry up and finish him!    What are you doing?    He's behind you!    You can't see me now, can you?    I found your weaknessby setting myself on fire.    It's the mouth, left open to breathe!    The thalamus is a relay stationfor all sensory information.    It sits above the upper jaw in your mouth.    Rods enter through your mouth    and rob your body heat away.    The rods targeted your thalamus.    Your eyes can't register me anymore!    Victory is mine!I won't have any more panic att*cks.    I will reclaim my life!    I am Apollo   !    I don't need my sight.    The rods are targeting my mouth?    Then I won't breathe either.    Rikiel first came after the helicopter.    Just as I sensedThe Green Baby's position,    and just as the priest sensedthat I've broken out…    I will ask what you are.    Next, I will ask    what the priest is planning.    Her resolve is stronger than ever before.    Jolyne's determined to reach the priest.    She inherited the convictionfrom her father Jotaro Kujo.    Is this the same Jolynewho used to cry over nothing?    You won.    But it is I, Rikiel, who will helpthe priest get to Heaven.    Rods have already infected my body.    The nerves in my head and bodyhave been cut off.    I'm now numb to any pain or shock.    I will fight until I die.    Take my life in exchange for yours.    Will you defeat me first?    Or will the rods rob your body heat first?    My palm extinguished the flamecovering your first vertebra!    I'll k*ll you!    Get her, rods!    Jolyne!    Jolyne!    Jolyne!    What is this?    sh*t.    I intentionally subdued the firecovering her neck    so that the rods can rob her body heat.    My hand… dammit.    My hand is numb.    My fingers    kept her neck safe!    f*ck.    -Jolyne!-Jolyne won!    Did you mean to keep my hand on your neckbefore you b*at me down?    Or was it all a coincidence?    It was a fluke.    I was desperate.    An answer I hoped for. How kind.    Do you mean it?    What are you?    Why did you go to the priest?    Listen. I'm content right now.    Before, I couldn't even ride a car.    Now, I can breathe just fine.    The priest filled a hole in my heart.    That's why I gave up my life for him.    Running through the priest's veins    is the conviction of a man named Dio.    Dio's will draws the sons to the priest.    We are merely pawns of fatewho help the priest reach heaven.    Jolyne Cujoh,    you are no exception.    You reaching Cape Canaveralwill only serve the priest's purpose.    I now understand.    You said so yourself,it was a coincidence.    You didn't mean for my handto stay on your neck.    Nothing but luck.    It doesn't matter whether I win or lose.    I understand now.    The priest needs your luck.    Coincidences that tilt in your favor.    That is what he wishes for!    You have the strongest fateout of anyone else.    Is it me?    Or is it you?    The priest needs the onewith the stronger fate.    The strongest power of this universe    isn't attained through calculations.    Fate gathers and takes shape.    That man also has a unique fate.    That is why the priest extractedonly his memory    and kept him alive all this time.    Weather Report.    If that man breaks free,    then it's not to help your cause.    He will carry his powerful fateto the priest.    When a new star-shaped birthmarkemerged on Father Pucchi,    the same must have appearedon Weather's shoulder.    He is the priest's younger brother.    Don't waste your time listeningto his nonsense.    My sister was k*lled    by Sports Maximum,who revived Dio's bones.    Was that also for fate's sake? Bullshit.    The priest existsso that I can b*at him to a pulp.    Let's go to Orlando.    We need to go find the priest.    Was it really a coincidence thatJolyne didn't move Rikiel's hand?    Or was it intentional?    Jolyne didn't say a worduntil the very end.

05x28 - Heaven is at Hand: Three Days Until the New MoonQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:37Ermes,  how fast are we going right now?  Is it    kph? Or    kph?  What?  We're ditching this ride. Emporio!  But the first timeI fully caught sight of rods,  it finally dawned on me.  The first step on the moonwas made by humanity's willpower.  On that same day,humanity left the Earth and evolved.   Mental evolution is invaluable!   This is nothing   compared to everything elsewe've been through.   Compared to finding that priest,   this is nothing.   This bitch!   I'm mentally stronger than her.   I'll k*ll you!   f*ck.   -Jolyne!-Jolyne won!   That is why the priest extractedonly his memory   and kept him alive all this time.   Weather Report.   He is the priest's younger brother.   Let's go to Orlando.   We need to go find the priest.   EPISODE   : HEAVEN IS AT HAND:THREE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON   GREEN DOLPHIN STREET PRISON   ESCAPED FROM HELICOPTER   ORLANDO   CAPE CANAVERALSPACE CENTER   ORLANDO, FLORIDA   HOURS BY CAR TO CAPE CANAVERAL   Hurry! Prepare Emergency Room  !   Male, eight years old.He's in critical condition.   My baby, Mike!   He will be okay. Everything will be fine.   Hey, Jolyne.   This is an urgent care facility.   Is the priest really hiding here?   He's here.   I have no doubt.   I don't know why he's here,   but this is where we'll settle the score.   THREE MORE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON   Emporio.   Can you do me a favor?   I want you to deliver my father's disc,which you've kept safe for us.   Call this number,and the Speedwagon Foundation will come.   I'm going inside with you.   Of course you are,but I want you to deliver the disc first.   The priest must know thatI'm closing in on him.   I don't want to be apart from you,   but this is important.   Hold onto this phone we took from Rikiel.   Sorry to bother,but I'd like your opinion.   It concerns this meal.   I want you to try it,if only for a single bite.   Versus.   Try a bite.   Tell me the ingredients.   I can't eat shellfish.   I'm very allergic to them.   This is whitefish.   Flounder, to be more precise.   It also contains sliced asparagus.   The asparagus is incorporatedinto some ground crabmeat.   It is then steamed like a flan.   There's no shellfish in it.   Excellent.   I'm not done.   Could I have another bite with the sauce?   I smell something in the sauce.   It may contain ground scallops   mixed in with whipping cream.   Unfortunately, it's just as I thought.There's shellfish in this sauce.   So your shoe size is   cm?   Will you stand up for me?   Take your time so that the g*nsh*t woundon your leg won't open up.   Height,    cm.   Weight,   kg even.   Size,   .   Watch size is two holes up.   Correct.   Interesting.   Though I won't be able to enjoy this dish,   you were able to discernthe scallop in the sauce.   We share a similar sense of taste.   Interesting indeed.   Father Pucchi,   what are you hinting at?   I haven't seen my ability yet,   while our enemy draws near by the second.   I want to serve you.   What should I do?   This can't be helped.   That in itself is not a problem.   -Mike…-Are you okay?   He's really close.   He's around here.   You haven't seen your ability,but that can't be helped.    Let the power take its course,and do not try to resist.    Because reaching heaven    means having these factors on our side.    Jolyne may very well forgetto check this room.    Anyway, I ordered this item becauseit's supposed to be shellfish-free.    Feel free to eat it.    Father Pucchi.    I… was…    I was…    I was sh*t.    The ambulance was fun.    But my dad hates me.    My dad is the one…    who sh*t me!    Honey? Honey!    Honey!    He got sh*t!    Honey, no!    This room doesn't look right.    Where is the priest?    What is happening?    This situation…    I've no doubt it's the doingof his new ally.    But this doesn't seem likea Stand ability.    He was sh*t by a real b*llet.    And who is he?    Who is this man?    Why was he sh*t?    He's an ordinary citizen!    Evacuate everyone on this floor. Hurry!    Y-yes sir.    You two over there, evacuate!    I'll call the police.    I know, the man who got sh*t!    They were the parents of that boy    who rushed here in an ambulance!    It might be a test sh*t…    I don't know what the ability is about,    but it could be a newly awakened ability.    If so, the user would wantto know what it is    by testing it out.    What's this?    They're on the move.    The priest is on the run!    He's inside this hole.    I can sense him moving away.    Listen Jolyne.    Don't you dare go down that hole.    Got that? I won't allow it.    This is obviously a trap!    We need to find out the connectionbetween this hole and the sh**ting.    Until then, stay away from this hole!    The hole goes sidewaysto the hospital courtyard.    I can't see any further.    The enemy that's with the priest…    His name is Versus.Twenty-five years old, male.    Listen, Jolyne.    I'll say this again.We won't go down this hole.    We'll either wait for them to come out    or chase them out like rabbits.    Yes, this hole is an obvious trap.    But what if the priest    waits three more days in this hole,until the new moon rises?    Yes, the priest would do just that.    He may even use this holeto reach Cape Canaveral.    In three days,the priest will attain the power    that he calls "reaching heaven."    As of now, the priest's ability is limited    to Pale Snake, which manipulates memories.    We can still win.    This is our only chance to stop him.    We'll put him out of commission,    or if things turn bleak,we may even have to k*ll him.    Hold on to this.    Don't ever let go.    Hey, Jolyne!    What are you doing? I'm coming with you!    If you come with me,then who's going to pull me out?    Wrap my thread around your body.    I'll send a signal if I'm in danger.    In that case,do whatever it takes to pull me up.    This is crazy. It's Jolyne's thread.    How far can she actually gowhile emitting this from her body?    Jolyne?    Jolyne!    Why won't you answer me?    Jolyne!    This place…    STAND NAME: UnderworldSTAND MASTER: DONATELLO VERSUS    This place…        ?    What's going on?    Look, it's her.    She's tied to her thread.    I'll go cut it.    What is this place?    Ermes, it's not looking good.Can you hear me?    Pull me up!    Hurry, Ermes! This is bad.    Get me out of here. They'll cut my thread!    Ermes, what's taking you so long?    Hurry, Ermes!    Pull me up!    Ermes!    You should be able to hear me!    Dammit, what's going on in there?    She hasn't gone too deep.    Ermes, faster!    Pull me up with all your strength!    I welcome you here,even with your outside shoes on,    and even if you didn't greet me.    You may enter my hole as you wish.    However, make sure to bringall of this tightened rope with you.    Stone Ocean!    Hey Versus, are you hurt?    Unlike you, who justawakened to a Stand ability,    Jolyne Cujoh has become an adept fighterat The Green Dolphin.    You could say she's a hardened fighter.    She won't hesitate to nick a penfrom a passenger.    Don't bother with Jolyne.    You've done excellently, Versus.    If Jolyne wants out, let her leave.    She won't try to set footin this hole a second time.    For the next three days,we will bide our time in this hole.    That will do.    Can you hear me, Ermes? I see the light!    I'm close to the exit. Pull me up!    I can hear you, Jolyne!    I caught a glimpse of you just now.Are you hurt?    What did you find down there?    The enemy is looking up at me from below.    But I also saw the priest down here.    We have to think of other waysto enter this hole.    I would've been deadif they cut off my thread.    Now talk to me, will you?    Huh, Ermes?    How do you feel right now?    You buried me alivein a prison sewage pipe.    How did it feel whenyou finally avenged your sister?    Sports Maximum!    What's going on, Ermes? Get it together!    Jolyne!    The Earth records the past.    It's like a magnetic tape,    or a digital camera.    It remembers the little boy    who fell to the groundafter being sh*t by his father.    Where the hell did you come from?    It remembers a gangsterwho was buried alive in a pipe.    It also remembers every detailof July     , seven years ago,    when a commercial flight crashedinto the ground.    Ermes, what're you doing up there?    Ermes!    Let go, jerk!    This is Versus's ability.    Underworld excavates.    It unearths memories!    Fucker!    Jolyne!    Attention all passengers.    It is July   ,     ,and time to destination is   :  .    This aircraft will crash to the ground.    Please turn off all electronic devices,    and fasten your seatbeltat your lower waist.    Also, the face of the passenger seatedat the rear gets lodged in my stomach,    by the crash impact.    What's going on?    Dammit, where is it?    Search for the exit, Ermes.    What is this place? Is this an illusion?    It was on the ceiling earlier.Find the hole where we came from.    The walls feel just as hardas the inside of a real plane.    We have to find the exit!    Did anyone come to the hospital room?    There was commotionover the little boy's father,    so the police should've come.    Didn't you see them?    I don't know, but even if they're there,    I couldn't hear you outside the hole.    Are we in a commercial plane?    I didn't see anything like thisfrom above!    Please do not punch the ceiling.    Please sit and wait quietly.    We will crash in less than three minutes.    I want to speak with the pilot.    Have him land the plane immediately.    Take us to the cockpit!    It's no use.    We couldn't make an emergency landing.    That's why we crashed.    What's wrong with her?    We all b*rned to death.    When the plane crashed,    there was an expl*si*n.    My body…    Excuse me, I asked you to turn offyour electronic devices.    This can't be.I remember hearing about this incident.    Flight     , en route to Dallas.    This plane crashed close to Orlandosix or seven years ago.    Are they ghosts…    We're memories,merely the facts of the event    recorded by the Earth.    Are we seriously about to crash?    Can't you speed up the crash?    I've been feelingWeather Report's presence.    They are really close to this hospital.    Cut the chatter. You confuse me.    Are you talking to me?    Underworld unearths memories.    The time of the crash was set at   :  .    And please don't forget    that I managed to drag Ermes along.    I did it all for you.    Leave this to me.    TWO MINUTES UNTIL CRASH
05x29 - Under WorldQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:38Keep going.  -Back!-Which one are you talking about, Weather?  Is it Jolyne, who you thinkis already near the hospital?  Or… do you mean the priest is nearby?  No, it's all three, Anasui.  Jolyne, the priest, and another enemy.  I feel all three of them.  Find them. Where are they?  Are they inside the building?   Attention all passengers.   It is July   ,     ,and time to destination is   :  .   This aircraft will crash to the ground.   TWO MINUTES UNTIL CRASH   What the hell are you doing?   Why are you messing with that door?   We can't find the exit on the ceiling.   The fastest way to get outis to defeat the Stand User.   Ermes, hold onto my thread again.   Grab onto to a fixture.   You, flight attendant,   go change the door to manual mode.   What? Hold on.   Isn't it dangerous to openthe door mid-flight?   Doesn't the air pressure…   No.   Go!   She's riding the airflowto strike the User!   Mayday!   Took a hit from a MiG.   Lost control of the aircraft.   This is coming to a close fast.   Who are you?   Doesn't matter.Looks like the back seat was compromised.   Check the damage for me, will you?   What's this?   f*ck!   Jolyne!   Stone Ocean!   McCoy on the line.   We just arrived at the scene.   This is incomprehensible,but there's a hole in a patient's room.   Its depth is unknown.   Jolyne Cujoh learned how to fightin prison.   She foresaw thather launched att*ck would fail.   She left the plane for the walkie-talkie.   She waited for the policeto arrive at the scene.   She knew the officers would bring radios.   She will call her ally now.   The frequency on those talkiescan be adjusted to dial cell phones.   Can't you just shut up for a moment?   Does it look like I'm losing?   Tell me, Father. Who's winning?   I grew up not knowing who my father was.   I got sick of my mother and stepfatherwho doted on my stepsisters,   so I ran away from home.   I was   .   I meant to be gone for a few days,   and I was wandering around,looking for a place to sleep.   Just then, a pair of spikesfell from the skies.   They were baseball spikes.   They smelled very nice.   Did someone toss them from a roof?   It made no sense.The spikes were brand new.   They were sized   . cm.   They were too big for my feet,   but I liked the satisfying soundsthey made.   I walked down the street cheerfully.   That's when the cops pulled overand arrested me.   This is not a trial.   We have questions for you.   Okay?   Did you steal them?   The shoes were signedby the baseball player Ichiro.   The pair was originally donatedto children with disabilities.   The collectors would payup to   ,    dollars for them.   The theft was all over the news.   I told her the truth.   They fell from the sky.   You should be ashamed of yourself,stealing from children with disabilities!   Go reflect on your actionsin juvenile detention!   This judge sent me to juvenile detentionbased solely on circumstantial evidence!   My parents did not appeal the case.   Four months later,   the actual thief confessed.   He feared Ichiro's spikeswould get traced.   So he tossed themdown a ventilation shaft,   and somehow the spikes fell onto my head.   By the time my innocence was proven,   my body and soul was already hurt.   I couldn't even walk straight.   Somehow, there was a holein the facility courtyard.   I tripped on it and fell.   There was a Kn*fe inside a plastic bagburied in the ground.   I stabbed my hand on it.   You've done it now.   I was hiding that Kn*fe, dammit.   The next day, a g*ng henchmanwho was three years older than I,   b*at the life out of me.   A doctor treated my wounds.    Yet two weeks later,    bloody pus and a worm gushed out.    I also almost d*ed from a terrible fever.    Since that day,    I hid from societyand started to live a tiresome life.    One time, I pissed next to a trash bin.    The walls crumbled down,    and a woman's skull showed itselffrom the walls.    And now,    I finally understandthe cause of my bizarre life.    It was my ability, Underworld!    Yes, at last,my ability is under control,     but does this meanI'm indebted to Father Pucchi?    No.    My father Dio's bloodruns through my veins.    Father Pucchi,    what makes you so much better than me?    I can throw you into that plane.    I haven't had a single slip-up.Not even one!    He rams through with his decisions,just like that old hag of a judge.    I'm getting really pissed at him.    I, Versus, am invincible.    Nothing is impossible with Underworld!    What makes him so special?    What if I present myself instead of himon the new moon?    Can I inherit the powerDio hoped to obtain?    I have the right too.    I'm Dio's son!    It's Weather Report's memory disc.    How can I use this to my advantage?    I want the power to go to heaven.    Jolyne!    Emporio, pick up the phone!    Emporio!    Hey you!Tell me the model of this fighter jet!    How do I eject?    The seat must be able to eject somehow!    I've seen it in movies.    Tell me how to eject the seat!    There's an ejection lever on the seat.    But I didn't eject, you see.    This jet crashed to the groundbefore I could escape.    Those are the facts.    No one can escape this aircraft.    Pulling the lever won't do a thing.    What's wrong, Jolyne?    It hasn't been that long.    Emporio!    I'm inside a hole at the hospital.    Ermes is on a commercial planethat crashed years ago.    I'm on a fighter jet.We're about to crash!    Search for ways to help us!    What?    Father Pucchi,    do you have any use for Jolyne's body?    The fighter jet pilot's bodywas never fully recovered.    The impact obliterated him.    Hello? Jolyne, take a deep breath.    I can't tell what's going on.    I'll head back to the hospital now.    No, Emporio.    I'm stuck in the memory of the past!    We can't change the crash.    My survival depends on getting out,but I can't eject!    No, we're out of time.    There's less than a minute left.    The fighter jet will crashbefore this plane!    You flew the fighter jet into…    You're right, Emporio.    It didn't explode, Emporio.    I rammed it into the commercial plane,but it didn't explode!    Of course, it didn't.    The fact is that the planes crashed.    So the planes will eventually crash.    Until then, they won't explodeno matter what you do.    -Jolyne!-I'm back!    Emporio, what should I do next?    Let me see.    It's Flight      to Dallas,a crash incident from six years ago.    Miraculously, two passengers survived.    I'm looking it up on my ghost computer.    Go find those two seats!    You may not be able to leave the aircraft,    but the ability runsthe exact course of events.    You can survive by sitting in those seats.    Emporio, hurry and find outthe seat numbers!    That's Jolyne Cujoh.    She forges her own paths.    Do you still thinkyou can finish her off, Versus?    Shut up!    Who does he think he is?    Found it, Jolyne!    A newspaper article publishedthe seat numbers of the two survivors.    They're Economy class,   D and   F.    It's at the very rear.    It also says thatthe plane crashed at   :  .    It's all true!    Run, Jolyne!    The enemy Stand is here!    It wants to get ahead of usand destroy the seats!    Thirty-two seconds left until impact.This is a minor setback.    I only have to destroy the seats.    That's all it takesto obliterate the fact.    Ermes!    Secure the seats!    We only have to sit in those seatsand survive the crash.    Then, we can face the Stand User!    Let's make it out of this alive    and defeat the Stand User!    The seats are still intact,but their attempt is futile.    There's only    seconds left.    I'll say this again.    The only safe seats are   D and   F.    Don't sit anywhere else!    According to the article,    all other seats were destroyedin an expl*si*n on impact.    It was a fluke causedunder miraculous circumstances.    The two seats were in an air pocket.    Once you sit down, buckle up.    Guard yourselves with your Stands,or you won't survive!    Move! I'm taking this seat!    What are you doing--    Shut up and scram!    You are nothing but recorded facts.    No more than memories of survivors!    You're not the people nor their souls.    The real old man is alive and happy.    Get out of my way.Jolyne, we don't have time.    Let's buckle up--    Move, brat!    You're in our seat!    Hold on, Ermes.    Where the hell did you come from?    This isn't my room.    Where am I?    I'm supposed to take my medicationafter my nap.    You came down from the ceiling!    Don't tell me you're…    This can't be!    They're not illusions, or even passengers!    Where's the nurse?    She's a real girl!    The assh*le pushed these kidsdown the hole!    What?    No need to destroy the seats.    Jolyne Cujoh.    Don't forget to buckle up.    Go on, push them out of the wayand take a seat.    That way, you two will survive.    Physically speaking, that is.    Once you crawl out of that plane alive,    you won't be able to bear the guilt.    Guilt that you sacrificed children's livesto save your own.    Will you be able to fight mewith so much guilt on your shoulders?    You won't be so cocky then.    Underworld may not besuitable for combat,    but it can deal enough damageto finish off such guilt-ridden fools.    Jolyne? What's going on? Hello?    What's happening? Who are you talking to?    Dammit, the plane is beginning to shake!    We'll put each child in our laps.    No, we'll all die.Each seat can only fit one person!    And there are three children!    Are we in your seats?    It takes me a second to stand up.    Sorry, we'll get out of your way.You can have your seat back.    It's time. Two seconds,    one second, brace for impact.    Jolyne!    STAND NAME: KissSTAND MASTER: ERMES COSTELLO    The victory is yours, Versus.    But I saw three children.    That's one too many.    Don't you feel guilty?    No, it wasn't my fault.    I was forced to do thisbecause Jolyne called her ally.    Jolyne kept resistingby finding the survivors' seats.    Not to mention, I did this for you,    Father Pucchi.    Look, Versus.    That's Ermes's sticker.    The surviving old man.    The fact of the matter isthat the survivors didn't die.    That's Ermes's sticker.    She copied the survivors    and kept the children safeinside their bodies.    Ermes! That means…    Where is Jolyne Cujoh?    Ermes!    Ermes!    She lodged herselfin the body of the other survivor!    Dammit, Ermes!    But Jolyne is dead!    Jolyne has nowhere to turn!    If I were you,    I'd think this through more carefully.    assh*le, whose side are you on--    Jolyne unraveled her body into threadsas much as she could.    She then hid inside my body,surviving the crash.    Good grief.    Jolyne Cujoh isn't filled with guilt,    but rather coming at you,burning with wrathful justice.    What will you do now, Versus?    Underworld!    You won't be digging a hole    or excavating memories any longer.    You're finally ours,    Father Pucchi!    Can I finish off the priest?    Or should we do this together?    Unfortunately, Versus,it looks like you lost.    Jolyne Cujoh's gravitational pull to me    was much stronger than yours.    Let's finish him off, Jolyne!    This groundhog is done for!    Weather Report!    What the hell? What did he just do?    Jolyne, finish him off!    When did you take it from me?    Was it when Jolyne blasted you?    Give it back immediately.    It belongs to me.    You don't understand what you're doing.    Sorry, but I'm not going to die here,    Father Pucchi.    My ability finally awakened.    I've never had anything to live up to.    I'm finally starting to understandwhy I was born.    You don't understand anything.    His memory must stay with me,    at least for another three days.    I won't end here!    I have the right to become happy!    What are you saying?    What are you guys talking about?    Jolyne,    finish him off already!    It's too late.    You can't finish me.    He will regain his memory.    I know it because I read his memory.    He's not the ally you think he is.    Memory?    Is he talking about Weather Report?    Did he throw Weather's disc?    Weather Report is more thana convict with amnesia.    He doesn't remember how his ability works.    His brother, Father Pucchi,sealed away his demonic powers!    He is the priest's younger brother.    So Rikiel was telling the truth,they really are…    Weather Report and Father Pucchi?    So you used Underworld    to read the disc's recorded facts.    Versus!You are nothing but a thatched hut.    You have no place in the grand purposeDio and I have fought for!    He's starting to remember.    Look, he's here.    Rainbows. There are rainbows!The devil's rainbows!    It's Heavy Forecast!    Weather, what's the matter?    Where's Jolyne? Why are you crouching?    Weather, what's wrong?    What are you doing?    What's your problem, punk?    I was sitting here first.    Don't touch me, I'll k*ll you!    THREE MORE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON
05x30 - Heavy Weather (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:39Weather Report!  When did you take it from me?  Was it when Jolyne blasted you?  Give it back immediately.  It belongs to me.  You don't understand what you're doing.  He's starting to remember.  Look, he's here.  Rainbows. There are rainbows!The devil's rainbows!   It's Heavy Forecast!   Weather, what's the matter?   What are you doing?   What's your problem, punk?   I was sitting here first.   Don't touch me, I'll k*ll you!   Hey! You can't takean injured person's seat--   Stop fussing.   You want him to sit, do you?   He can sit on you then.   Weather! What are you doing?   He's not an enemy!   He's just a nurse!   Now, sit all you want, crutch guy.   I've never felt better.   Wait up!   Weather, where do you think you're going?   Weather? Don't Weather me.   So I go by Weather Report now.   Not a bad name.   What happened to him?   It's as if…   he's gained an entirely new personality!   EPISODE   : HEAVY FORECAST ( )   Rainbows!   Rainbows are closing in on us!   Jolyne, we have no time to waste!   This looks serious!   It's over!   Meet your end!   -What the hell?-Ermes?   What just happened?   -Was it an illusion?-This is bad.   Your life is in danger, but so is mine.   You untied yourself.   I'm warning you.   Don't touch those rainbows.   Those are Weather Report's rainbowsFather Pucchi sealed up!   Weather Report's Stand abilitycontrols the weather.   Do you understand what this means?   With his memory restored,he can even destroy the ozone layer.   The ozone is even higher than the sky.   What could comefrom messing with the ozone?   I can only say that it won't end well,   but we're all in danger.   The survival of humanity is at stake!   It was a risky sacrifice,   but I used Weather Reportto save my skin!   What did the ozone do to my Kiss?   Answer me. Do these rainbows meanthat Weather's memory is back?   The rainbows come outfrom his subconscious.   Weather Report's Standhas an a*t*matic att*ck.   The weather is a complex phenomenon.   His ability manifests in wayshe doesn't realize.   His memory should neverhave been returned to him.   I'll tell you this.   To stop the rainbows,you must k*ll Weather,   or extract his memory again.   Jolyne, can you k*ll Weather?   If not, then humanity may endbefore the new moon.   Though, I won't end here.   You shouldn't let Versus escape.   Versus fled, Jolyne!   There are two women here!   -Officer!-Officer!   This is…   Was the hole this shallow?   He deactivated Underworld and took off!   Where did they go?   Did you see two men running off?   Which way did they go?   Before we get to that,   I've seen your faces…   On a wanted fugitives list!   Rainbows. Just what is going on?   It's everywhere!   Hey!   What's going on?   You two!   You're the escaped convicts!   Don't go anywhere!   Get over here!   -Don't touch the rainbows!-Stay away from them!   Jolyne!   What do we do?   This is terrible!   What is going on?   Anyone who touches a rainbowsecretes snails!   I've seen Weather rain downfrogs in a storm.   But these snails are entirely different.    How does this phenomenon relateto Weather Report    and his ability to manipulate the weather?    Not only that,    once infected by the snails,people are losing their minds.     You can't run!    What is going on?    Ermes!    Jolyne! Are you okay?    Yeah.    Ermes.    Compared to normal people,Stand Users may have a tolerance    to this kind of phenomenon.    So Jolyne,    who should we target?    Who do we need to defeat?    Is Weather Report an enemy,    or do we keep going after the priest?    Tell me, who do we get rid of?    Weather Report, with his memories,is our enemy!    No! Weather Report is our ally.    He's not our enemy!    We have to find Versus.    Just like the priest said,    we can't let Versus go free.    His ability is to excavate memories.    Maybe we can unearthWeather's memory disc,    and stop this bizarre phenomenon.    I like your line of thinking.    But first,    we need to get out of this hospital!    Hey! Where are you headed, Weather?    Is that where Jolyne is?    Tell me!    sh*t.    I want it.    I want that power.    I need to get it before the priest!    The power to attain heaven.    I want to live a good life!    What should be my next course of action?    Underworld!    Found it.    The memory of the groundwhen these two arrived at the hospital.    Ermes.    Now is our chance,when we go after Father Pucchi.    So don't worry.    What?    My father's disc can be sentto the Speedwagon Foundation,    while we have Father Pucchi's attention.    Emporio will not fail.    Father will finally come back to us.    So Emporio is the ally's namewhom Jolyne was calling.    I have to find him.    It's someoneeven the priest wasn't aware of.    I don't know what Emporio looks like,    since I haven't dug up a memory of him.    But with all this commotion going on,    Jotaro Kujo's disc must still be with him.    He hasn't gotten it to this foundation.    Jotaro's disc gave the priestthe idea of getting into heaven.    If I get a hold of that disc,    even I can go to heaven!    The rainbows are my chance!    Jotaro's disc belongs to me!    These snails are multiplying so fast,they've covered the entire floor!    They won't stop reproducing!    Snails are asexual.    They pierce each other with love darts.    Both snails then give birthto dozens of baby snails!    Good grief.    They have sex with anythingthat comes their way?    I'm a bit jealous… I mean, that's creepy.    -Ermes!-Got it.    Kiss!    Stone Ocean!    No User has two Stands.    Weather Report can onlycontrol the weather.    But this is entirely different.    Just what is going on?    STAND NAME: Weather ReportSTAND MASTER: Weather Report    Back when life first began to emergein the form of plants,    oxygen began to form.    Oxygen is made up of O ,    which bonds with a third oxygen molecule.    Ozone consists of O  molecules.    The ozonosphere occursat altitudes of    kilometers    to    kilometers.    If this ozone layerwere compromised in any way,    what would become of life on Earth?    Humans cannot predictirregularities in weather patterns.    We can only analyze past weather patterns    collected over decades.    I'm going ahead!    Where is he? He has to be here.    He must be close by.    I'll find him and seize the disc,    before it's handed to that foundation!    He'll probably head to the hospital    because he won't abandon Jolyne!    The one who goes in to find Jolynemust be Emporio!    He'll be the one who's goingopposite everyone else.    Dammit! I refuse to lose!    I'm going to live a happy life!    Jolyne, I wish I could help.    But…    I have to go deliver this discto the Foundation's messenger!    I promised Jolyne to gether father's disc to the Foundation.    The Foundation rep saidto meet in five minutes!    Dammit!    What the hell?    No one is headed toward the hospital!    He has to be in the area.    I just know it!    Hello? Jolyne?    Hello?    I got you now.    Thanks, Underworld.The earth never fails me.    The memory of Jolyne had his number!    Emporio relayed the survivors'seat numbers to Jolyne    using his cell phone!    Meaning, Jolyne knows his cell number!    Who would've thoughtEmporio was a little boy?    Even the priestdidn't know about this kid.    What's this? He doesn't have the disc.    Moreover, he doesn't have hisphone either.    He had it a moment ago!    Hold on, I need to keep my head cool.    I can excavate to learnwhat he did with the disc.    I can watch him put it away!    Oh, sh*t.    It's them!    -Are you sure he came this way, Jolyne?-Yeah.    I feel his presence over here.    I'm sure I saw Emporio going this way.    Wait, do you think he's after Emporio?    Impossible.    Even the priest doesn't knowabout Emporio, so how can Versus know?    -That's…-Emporio!    Watch out! Jump!    Disgusting!    These are real, all right.    Not illusions.    So slimy and gross.    Ermes!    Jolyne, go without me.    Go find Emporio!    That was definitely him getting dragged.    I don't know how he found out,but Versus is after Emporio.    Stone Ocean!    Dammit.    My rope!    My movements are slowed to snail's pace!    Emporio!    If you can hear me, pull on my rope!Grab onto it!    Forty-five, sixty!    Hut!    Jolyne!    This is Florida.    I dug up memories about the Superbowl.    Jolyne Cujoh,    the quarterback will carry youall the way to the touchdown line.    My thread!    You are too slow to do anything.    Bye. You're too far away now.    Yikes, I shouldn't touch these snails.    I wasn't wrong.    He had Jotaro's disc just moments ago.    A second later,his disc suddenly disappears.    He must have used his Stand ability.    He's able to stash thingswith his ability.    Then where did he put the disc?    I should check again.    What?    Where's Jolyne?    She's a snail. She can't move quickly!    Unbelievable, she caught up to him.    She rolled over!    She squeezed into a streetlight polethat broke in half.    Now that her body has turned gooey,she can easily fit in a metal pole!    Underworld!    I didn't expect you to roll yourself over,    but this doesn't change a thing.    You are still powerlessagainst my Underworld!    I excavated a certain memory.    Memory of ocean waterevaporating and leaving salt!    Snails and slugs can't stand salt!    What?    sh*t, where is it?    I know you have the disc somewhere.    You've hidden it somewhere.    Where did you stash it?    I see, so our Stands work similarly.    His Stand controlsthe memories of objects.    I did it!    I found Jotaro's memory disc!    It's mine now!    I win!    And now, finally,    I'm a step closer to the heaventhat priest is after!    Jolyne!    I'm sorry, Emporio.    I used you as bait.    You touched me,    and he touched you.    Feeling the sensation… All at once…    I'm so slow!    Damn right, he's ours now!    Nice going, Jolyne!    Emporio.    It's no use.    The Speedwagon Foundation's messengercan't enter the city limits.    He's just standing by.    Is that right?    Nicely done.    You got it, carjacker.    Let me set things straight.    I've never stolen a car.    I'm messing with you.    You're coming with us.    Don't even think about running again.    I know.    What's this?    Are these the driver's shells?    But why just shells?    Shells here too.    Okay, I'm catching on.    I don't know what Weather didto transform people into snails.    But I do know what lies ahead of us.    The snails' natural enemieswhich feed on them.    Snails can only move slowly,    so they often die like this.    These beetles stick their headsinside the shells    and devour the snails!    That's why these beetles are calledsnail eaters!    These buggers!    Hey Weather!    I said wait up! Hey!    What's going on?    Did you cause this?    Weather! What have you done?    Silence, Anasui.    He is closing in on us.    He is within a   -meter radius.    Him? You mean, Father Pucchi?    He's here.    My sole purpose in life    is to settle my score with him.
05x31 - Heavy Weather (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:39June  th,     .  On a hot humid night,deep in the southern United States,  one baby let out his first cryin a hospital.  However, this baby took his last breathin his mother's arms  before even seeing the first light of day.  Until this point in her life,this young mother had a hard life,  and felt hopelessly miserable.  This baby had becomeher only pride and joy,  and her only hope for a bright future.   Thus, she refusedto accept the baby's death.   Before the doctor and the nursessaw that the baby d*ed,   the mother slipped out of her bedlike a ghost.   She found another babyborn on the same day,   and left her dead baby in its place.   She then kept the baby as her own.   The swapped baby had a fraternal twin.   She was never questioned,   and no one suspected foul play.   Mommy, whose grave is this?   That's my birthday.   He d*ed the same day?   Enrico,   you had a younger brother.   He was your twin,   but he d*ed at the hospitalmoments after you were born.   Pray for him.   After his passing,   we named him Domenic.   Oh Lord, answer my plea.   My brother passed awayon the day we were born.   Why did fate choose him and not me?   Why… must there behappiness and misfortune?   What is true happiness?   Father Pucchi was   years old at the time.   His paternal grandmotherwas an Italian immigrant.   She came from a family with tiesto a prestigious clan in Venice   which hailed a well-known clergymanin the   th century.   When the young man showed interestin pursuing priesthood,   no one spoke out against this decision.   What did you do? Who are you?   What are you doing here?   Hey!   Is this your book?   This is a famous autobiography of a clericwho had an affair with a married woman.   He later left the churchand became a painter.   Do clergymen read such books?   Who are you, and how did you get inside?   This ossuary is closed to the publicexcept on Sundays.   You see, I'm allergic to sunlight.   The sun won't set until  :   p.m. tonight.   I'm unable to leave until then,   so that's why I was resting here.   All right.   Is there anything I can do for you?   No.   I see.   I pity you.   I won't tell Father about this,   so you should leave at sunset.   You're an interesting fellow.   What's that?   You won't force me to leave?   I could be a thief who snuck into steal the artwork here,   or even worse.   Or maybe you're justsaying that I can stay,   but you're going to report me.   Is that your wish?   No thief would lie and saythat they're allergic to sunlight.   Not even the devilwould tell a lie like that.   Hold on.   Did you sprain your ankle?   Was that my fault? Are you hurt?   Oh, no.   It's not your fault. I was born with this.   My left toes are bent,   but I can walk around just fine.   Do you believe in the force of gravity?   You tripped on me for a reason.   What are you saying?   Take this stone arrowhead.   If you have no use for it, that's fine.   But isn't it gravitythat draws people to each other?   I don't knowwhat impression you have of me,   but I travel to meet people.   If you ever wish to see me again,   wish upon this arrow and call me.   No matter how far in the futurethat may be.   Do you understand?   Just keep me in your back burner.   At sunset,   I will leave.   What's this?   My foot! The toes!   They're straight!   Wait! Who are you?   Father.   Please hear me out.    I must confess my sins.    Sorry,    let me go get the priest…    My body is stricken with an illness.    I don't have much longer.    But my confessionisn't about this illness.    It concerns my family.    It was    years ago, on June  th.    My baby d*ed,so I took another woman's baby,    and swapped the two babieswhile no one was looking.    I took one of the twins.    I cannot express how terrible I feelfor the baby's mother.    But I poured my heartinto raising this baby.    I had a happy life.    He grew up to be a great boy.    Shouldn't I tell him thathe has a twin brother    before I leave this world?    What if I tell him the truth,    and my son leaves me before I die?    So…    Do you know the other family?    They live in a large estatein the neighboring town.    The couple's name is Pucchi.    Seriously?    What's so good about a juice delivery boy?    Gross.    I bet he's a coward.    -I love that.-Forget him, his family's probably poor.    He doesn't even go to high school.    That's why he works.    Perla, isn't that your bag?    He snatched it!    Thief!    Someone stop him!    -Woo-hoo!-Yes!    Oh, crap!    I broke the store window.    I'll get fired fromthis part-time delivery job.    My school doesn't even allowstudents to work.    Weather Report's real nameis Wes Aquamarine.    He was    at the time.    He was innocentin every sense of the word,    and he relentlessly pursued justice.    Well… Thanks.    That was my bag he tried to steal.    I'll tell everyone thatthe thief smashed the window.    -Really?-Of course.    Now go.    I'm Wes.    People call me Weather.    Can I see you again?    Two months have passedsince that confession.    Father Pucchi was under distress.    Though not yet appointed a priest,    he is obliged to keep the privacyof the believers.    He must keep the confession a secret.    Otherwise,    he would be deemed unworthyas a clergyman.    That mother wants totake her secret to her grave.    Had I been able toconvince her to tell the truth,    how will we cope,and how will my younger brother react?    Will we be able totreat our families the same?    I'm home.    Welcome back.    Why are you spaced out on the porch?    Did something happen at school?    Please, Enrico.    Don't tell Mom and Dad about this!    What?    My grades are slipping.    I'll make up for it,but there's something on my mind.    I'm dating someone.    We met only two weeks ago,    but I really like him.    It's like our hearts are connected.I've never felt like this.    I'm happy for you, Perla.    Enrico…    Let me tell you how this went.    Father Pucchi never told his sister Perla,    that Weather was their biological brother.    I want you to judgethe rest of the events.    Who committed a sin?    Is it the mother, who swapped the babies?    Or is it Father Pucchi's parents?    Is it Father Pucchi?    Is it the younger brother Weather,who knows nothing?    Father Pucchi looked into Weather,the man his sister loved.    After learning the shocking truth,    Father Pucchi had only one choice to make.    I can't let my sister get hurt,no matter what!    You're that wealthy kidwho goes to divinity school.    Should you be doing this?    If you succeed, I'll give you double.    I have two requests.    One, do not ask any questions.    Two, make them break up.    If I can get some thugs to thr*aten Wes,    he'll break up with my sister.    That's all Perla will experience,    nothing but an ordinary heartbreak.    This won't leave a permanent scar.    However, Father Pucchibarely knew anything    about this private investigator,a jack of all trades.    How keen he was to information,nor the darkness he carried.    It is the darkness this society had,which was allowed by law a century ago.    It is a despicable old history.    I can't believe what I learnedabout Wes's birth.    In     , his mother married    a black man in the city.    That makes him the son of a black man.    The private detectivegathered other zealots.    Weather!    Perla…    What are you doing? You're all drunk!    We won't hurt you.    He's the one we need to punish.    Come give me a kiss.    One for this officer too!    You're a whore pretending to bea proper little missy.    Fool around with whomever you want,    but this bastard isn't allowedto kiss you, not even a little.    Your brother wanted this done.    And as for the womanwho gave birth to you,    we set her house on fire.    Who was the one truly being punished?    Was it Weather, Perla, or…    They all tried to love in their own ways.    These are the facts.    Father Pucchi's lovebrought the worst outcome.    Weather was hung highon a tree by a cliff,    and left to die.    Perla truly had a pure heart,    which was filled with a soft breezeuntil this moment.    Their love was like the warm spring sun.    However…    In my heart,    there will never be another drop of rain.    And with those words,    Perla threw herself downinto the lake below the cliff.    She did not knowthat Weather had a slight pulse.    Why?    How could this happen?    Why did I pursue the path of priesthood?    Why do people meet?    Had they never met,    this would have never happened.    No!    Stop that!    Don't make the sign of the crossat my sister!    Dammit.    Please, just don't take Perla's life!    Perla is innocent.    She only fell in love!    I'll do anything to bring her back!    I'm the one who should be punished!    Do you believe in the force of gravity?    We met for a reason.    If you wish,    come see me.    It's him.    That was his voice.    I want to see him.    He once healed my bent toesin the ossuary.    Why did I forget about him until now?    That's right, he gave me…    an arrowhead-like thing.    What is going on?    The arrowhead in my pocket?    Once a life is lost,    you cannot bring it back.    But it's up to you.    If you wish from deep within your heart,    you can retrieve her memory.    It's the memories of her heart.    This is your awakening.    Who the hell are you?    The idiot who wantedan affair investigated?    If you don't want to get sh*t,show your dirty face--    What's this?    If you know, then tell me.    What?    I heard you know everything.    What made these snails emergeout of the blue?    Where do they come from?    Why is it only happening near me?    Who the hell are you?    You said Perla's brotherasked you to split us.    Is that true?    No, you can't be…    What are these snails?    Damn. I knew it, I can't die.    The gunpowder is soaked.    But only when I try to sh**t myself.    Why am I still alive?    Weather was full of rage.    He was enraged at thosewho persecuted him,    at the fact that he was alive,    and that he couldn't save Perla.    Once Weather learned about Perla's death,    he jumped off the cliff.    Just then,there was a strong gust of wind.    He also tried to drown himselfin the lake,    but the waves brought him back to shore.    Why won't you let me die with Perla?    His anger was one of despair.    His vengeance spread to all,not just to the townspeople.    On the fourth night,    a horde of snails swarmed the town.    Why snails?    Where did they come from?    No one knew.    The only one who understoodthe cause of this incident    was Father Pucchi,who woke up in a hospital.    Wes… no, Weather did this.    My brother isn't dead.    We are twins.    My awakening led to his.    Just as I sought her memory,so did Weather, though subconsciously.    If these snails are here tocrawl up my arm,    then I have to go k*ll my brother.    I will resort to any and every methodfrom now on.    I will even take lives.    Once my score with Weather is settled,    I will go see him.    His name is Dio.    Why do people's paths cross?    If anyone can tell me, it's him.    I must know it.    The answer to this questionis the strongest power in this world.    It must also be the truth.    Are you satisfied?    Your sister Perla d*edbecause of your request.    And…    I can't suppress my rage.    We have a score to settle.    You're wrong.    It's because I am your older brother.    But that ends today.    Weather, meet your end.    Weather, you are in my way.    Now die,    and take those rainbows with you.    Vanish with Perla and all your memories.    A man with no memoriesmight as well be dead.    Live as if you're dead trapped in a cage.    Inmate MA      .    Imprisoned!    My sole purpose in life    is to settle my score with him.    So you've been revived.    Your memories returned!    But I thought you weregoing to meet up with Jolyne!    I'm only with you to find Jolyne!    You shouldn't go find Jolyne.    It'll be a waste of time.    Moreover,    I need someone to finish me off.    k*ll me.    I'm counting on you, Anasui.    That's why these beetles are calledsnail eaters!    These buggers!    Get in, guys!    They're coming in through the cracks!    What do we do, Jolyne?    Whether inside or outside the car,    it's over once we get devoured.    We'll go meet up with Weatheras we're being eaten!
05x32 - Heavy Weather (3)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:40Do you believe in the force of gravity?  We met for a reason.  Why?  How could this happen?  Why won't you let me die with Perla?  I can't suppress my rage.  We have a score to settle.  Weather, meet your end.  A man with no memoriesmight as well be dead.   EPISODE   : HEAVY FORECAST ( )   Dumbass!   Drive straight, idiot!   This better not be on purpose.   I can't even think about messing around!   Look, it's trying to eat me!   Weather…   What?   I sense Weather's presence near Pucchi's!   Are they together?   I can't tell,but they're near one another.   Weather!   What did you say? k*ll you?   -Yes.-Don't mess with me!   What is going on? Why do you say that?   In     ,   the same phenomenon struck my hometown.   What?   It seems that something deep withinmy heart is wreaking this havoc.   So your memories came back.   Then fix this mess!   I can't control this power.   k*ll me, and the Stand disappears.   I feel a sense of guiltabout turning people into snails,   but I abhor my life.   A part of me feels satisfiedto see this phenomenon.   You…   Jolyne better not be turning into a snail.   Try not to move.   I can't even begin to guess,   but it's likely that touching the snailstriggers metamorphosis.   Moreover,   I need someone to finish me off.   Stop with your bullshit.   Tell me where Jolyne is, right now!   I'll tell you after my scorewith Pucchi is settled.   Like I said, he is very close.   W-What?   He's here.   My sole purpose in life   is to settle my score with him.   I'm also doing this for F.F.   I have to stop Pucchifrom using Jolyne's father's memory.   It's time to put an end to everything.   I will finish off Pucchi.   Once I do, k*ll me.   Do you understand?   All right.   I also owe him one for F.F., too.   I'll see you through.   So where's the priest?   North? Or south?   It's not even a matter of the direction.   He's already here.   He's within our   -meter radius.   He's not underground.I checked with Diver Down.   Are you sure he's moving throughthese swarms of snails   to close in on us?   Weather Report!   There's no disruption in the air flow.   Nothing is breathing or moving.   What about inside the cars, Weather?   Weather!   I am painfully awareof your control over the weather.   Every living thing, animals, and insects,turns into snails in this phenomenon.   Once I learned how the weather works,   I no longer fear touching the snails!!   I now know why it happens.   When I extracted your memory in     ,   I overcame this Stand,though it almost cost me my life!   You…   Pucchi, you bastard!   You are also finished.   You should have servedyour prison sentence   instead of getting involvedwith Jolyne and me.   Dammit…   Why?   Why isn't Pucchi affected?   How do these snails work?   Tell me, Weather!   This will do.   If you are going to die, Weather,I hope it takes a few more hours.   That's why I blasted your leg off.   That should be enough time for your Stand   to eliminate anyone who gets in my way.   The one who will help me get to heaven,   it's none other than you, Weather.   The new moon rises in three days.   Then, everything will begin.   The thing that The Green Baby sought    and the heaven that Dio hoped to reachis inside my body.    I submerged Diver Down…    into Weather's body!    Weather Report!    Grab hold of the priest, Weather!    His Stand is inept at fighting!    Once you grab him, you can overpowerhim with your gust of wind!    Now, grab him! Don't let him get away!    What?    Weather!    Damn it, why am I turning?    I haven't touched any snails!    Pucchi!    What the hell did you do?    Tell me!    It's subliminal.    Like hidden words in a poster,    indiscernible wordsare incorporated in images.    Or a single frameis inserted into a film reel.    Though imperceptible they may be,    the subconscious retains that information.    That's the definitionof subliminal messaging in psychology.    It's an effect on the subconscious.    Subliminal messages easily enter the mindand stimulate instinct    more effectively than direct methods.    They powerfully influenceand take over human behavior.    Weather Report's rainbows    are sending subliminal messagesin the form of the weather.    The image is seeping into the heartsof everyone in the city.    Are images of snailshidden in the rainbows?    Do rainbows stimulate primitive instincts?    Anyone who sees the rainbow    starts to believe thatthey are turning into a snail.    This strong belief forces the bodyinto metamorphosis.    What? What did you just explain?    This is the answer.    It's the mechanism ofWeather Report's ability I sealed.    My hometown was affected by his powerslong ago.    When I saw a blind old womanunaffected by the phenomenon,    I realized how his ability works.    She was blind? That means…    Weather,    I don't need vision to see where you are.    I've extracted my sight,but I can sense you.    Let me tell you.    It's too late to close your eyes,Anasui.    Once the subliminal message settlesin your brain, you cannot undo its effect.    This phenomenon will not enduntil Weather dies.    I'll take the other leg, for good measure.    You will never stand again.    Diver Down!    Don't let your rash feelings take over.    We must all get to heaven.    My purpose can bringall human beings to heaven.    You are getting in my way.    You're letting a few deaths dictatethe fate of the masses!    Domine quo vadis?    You shall be crucified!    What… just stabbed me?    This is your doing, Weather.    What are you doing?    What is this sound?    What are you scheming to do?    This Weather Report abilityis something I can control.    I can take my time.What counts is that I form them.    They can be simple!    The blood was blown upwards,then frozen with a cold draft.    He's making spikes in the blood puddles.    The priest can't see them!    What will you choose?    Yes, it's your choice to stay blind,    but you may also choose to seewhat's happening for yourself!    Trip, and your life will end.    I'm coming for you now.    STAND NAME: PALE SNAKESTAND MASTER: FATHER PUCCHI    Pucchi, you have no way to escape.    Will you restore your sight?    Do it. I'll reflect the rainbowsright into your face.    Weather just has to grab Pucchi.    Pale Snake is no matchfor Weather Report.    Weather will win.    I knew you'd resist somehow.    No, you won't just let me leave.    Not after regaining those memories.    And yet!    Anasui!    Eyes are everywhere.    I used them to get this far.    Anasui, do me a favor.    Be my eyes.    Tell me what you see.    Tell me the dangers that surround me.    What is Weather doing?    He used his spilled blood to make spikesthat protrude from the ground.    Three spikes right behind you.    Four more to your right.    I see.    Will you guide me out of this spike trap?    Continue.    Take three steps,and six spikes lie ahead.    Turn left.    Weather.    You were cursed from the momentyou were born.    Stay down.    Your life is fated for doom.Nothing can save it.    It would've been betterif you had lost your memories forever.    Turn left and take five steps.    Face right, and you are out.    Okay. Five steps.    That's right. Five more steps.    Also, I just noticed this.    Since I can see it, I'll tell you.    There's one more spike.    I didn't notice it until nowsince I was looking down at the ground.    One of them pierced through your shoulder.    Weather is freezing your blood.    Oh, too late.    A cheap trick!    It's not a trick.    Weather is stronger than you.    Weather is going to win!    This wind pressure!    I must get out of Weather's att*ck range!    Just evade once.    He just has enough strength leftfor one att*ck!    Take your own blood spikes!    It's useless!    Weather can dodge your throw easily!    Yes, he will dodge.    When he does, the wind pressurewill shift its direction.    That's my chance to escape!    You're mine now.    I finally have you.    He didn't dodge.    Weather caught the priestby freezing more blood!    Weather has him in his range!    Is he dead?    Let go, Weather.    I had every chance to finish you offinside Green Dolphin Street Prison.    But… I hoped to save you one day.    That's why I took your memory only.    I'm not pleading for my lifeto save my own skin.    Prime numbers.    -I did it for you, my younger brother.-Two,    Three,    -It was for the ability to get to heaven.-Five.    Someone must reach heaven one day.    Seven.    -Don't do this, Weather.-Eleven.    -Stop trying to end your life and mine!-Thirteen.    Seventeen.    You do not realize your own evil.    You are the worst form of evil.    -Nineteen.-He's horrified.    The priest's face is frozen with despair.    Twenty-three.    Stop this, Weather. You are wrong!    You are nothing but a cursed man!    -And yet, I kept you alive!-You are finished now,    Father Pucchi!    What the hell are you doing?    I said I'll k*ll you ifyou do anything suspicious!    No! A dust storm suddenly started.    Something like a screw busted the tire!    I lost control!    He's close by.    We are close to Weather!    The priest too!    But something about the outside seems off.    You're right I can't see well,    but something issticking out of the ground.    Weather!    I know you're close by.Answer me, Weather!    What the hell are these things?    What happened here?    The priest is moving close to us.    We are extremely close to him.    We have to find Weather.We need to find him as soon as we can.    There's something horrific happening here.    Did Weather cause this dust storm?    Hasn't the priest turnedinto a snail by now?    I don't know.    I just know that he's here.Search for him!    Jolyne, I saw someone.    He's over this direction!    I can't tell whether it was Pucchi orWeather, but I definitely saw someone!    Jolyne, the wind is dying.    Also, my body is starting togo back to normal.    Does this mean…    Pucchi!    No, Jolyne.    We can't fully controlour bodies or Stands yet.    We lack the speedand strength to defeat him.    We have to find Weather first.    Defeat the priest,and we'll know where Weather is.    Stone Ocean!    Jolyne!    -What?-Weather!    No one can catch up to me now.    Spend your remaining dayswith your family and loved ones.    It's futile to come after me.    I will win.    Stop, Jolyne.    Anasui!    This isn't the priest.    The priest already left.    What?    This is a revelation.    That's not Pucchi either.It's a visage of the past.    This must be Pucchi's ability too.    Versus!    The priest    left a disc in his headduring the dust storm.    Pucchi's visage overlapped with his body.    This was the presence you sensed.    The priest had already finished him off.    This is a revelation.    Fate had chosen me.    -It is guiding me to heaven…-…in three days' time.    -If it hadn't, I would have been defeated…-Do you believe in the force of gravity?    You were drawn here by gravity.    Weather!    I told you. It's a visage.    -No one can catch up…-…to me now…    I'm no longer a snail. What happened?    Where's Weather, Anasui?    Where did Weather go?Ermes, where's Weather?    You don't sense his presence anymore?    You don't know where he is?    Emporio!    Ermes, call a doctor.    -The doctors should be back to normal.-Jolyne…    -Emporio!-Jolyne!    The wind has stopped blowing.    The rainbows are gone, Jolyne.    This can't be.    Does this have something to dowith our car accident?    Did this happen because we came?    Listen, Jolyne.    People say that I'm a cold-blooded k*ller.    At least, the newspapers said so,and I completely agree with it.    When they asked meif I would give my life for my parents,    I answered no.    I would still say the same.    My parents can't move my heart.    But…    I will give my life for the peoplewho brought me back to life.    Weather was one of these people.    This disc…    Right.    When Weather got impaled by Pale Snake,    he used his enemy's ability.    He used Pale Snaketo seal his ability inside a disc.    Jolyne…    Weather left this for you.    Weather came back to lifewhen he left the prison.    This is the proof.    He was truly happy the last few days.    Weather was already saved!    Weather…    I wish…    I wish we could talk just one more time.    I want to talk to youin the warm breeze again.
05x33 - Gravity of the New MoonQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:41Ermes, call a doctor.  -The doctors should be back to normal.-Jolyne…  -Emporio!-Jolyne!  The wind has stopped blowing.  The rainbows are gone, Jolyne.  He was truly happy the last few days.  Weather was already saved!  I wish…  I wish we can talk just one more time.   I want to talk to youin the warm breeze again.   MARCH   ST,      -   :   AM   TWO MORE DAYS UNTIL THE NEW MOON   Weather Report…   He didn't want me to despair,   and wanted to tell meto keep going after the priest.   So he used Pale Snake's ability   to leave his own ability in a disc.   If I insert this disc into my head,   would I be able to use his ability?   But the priest is alreadyon his way to Cape Canaveral.   We don't even have two daysuntil the new moon.   It could well be   that this is already out of my hands.   What should I do?   Despite the snail commotion,   my father's disc is now inthe Speedwagon Foundation's hands.   My father will wake up sooner or later.   He would know what to do.   Should I wait for him?   But the priest may take drastic measuresin Cape Canaveral before Dad wakes up.   What should I do?   Dad, tell me.   Had I not gotten in the car,   would Weather still be alive?   No, I have to keep moving forward.   I have to go to Cape Canaveral.   I have to defeat the priest.   Dad, tell me.   What can someone like me do?   What can I do?   EPISODE   : GRAVITY OF THE NEW MOON   How cute.   Wow.   She looks adorable.   Jolyne fell asleep on my shoulder!   That's right.   I finally found you.   There's something I meant to tell you   if I managed to break out of prisonand find you.   I don't have time to waste.   If I don't say this now, then when?   My feelings are honest and true.   I spent a fortune buying this ringfrom the prison scrounger.   Once you wake up,   please accept my love for you.   Hey, look!   Alligators! They're this far inland!   Dammit.   They may be a protected species,but they sure gave us hell in prison!   Seriously? Whoa, massive alligators.   Take this, dumbass!   Woo-hoo, I got one!   They reacted! They're startled!   They're not moving, but they're scared.   Don't mess with us, you overgrown lizards!   Dumbasses!   You couldn't have…   Jolyne!   What did you throw just now?   Show it to me. Show me your hand!   What's with you?   What's all this shouting?   I said, open your hand!   What the hell?   Anasui, why are you excited?   You…   You couldn't have! You can't have!   Ermes.   -Can you do me a favor?-What is it?   I want to see the map for this area.   Can you hold onto this for me?   Sure.   When you say map, you mean GPS, right?   This is such an old computer.   This is our current location,Cape Canaveral.   North latitude,    degrees    minutes,   west longitude,    degrees    minutes.   Cape Canaveral is on the Florida Peninsulaby the Atlantic Ocean.   It's a vast area of   ,    hectares.   It's a sandbank formed by natureover a long time.   Sandbank?   It's a geological featureformed by sand deposits.   This is our destination.   The Space Center.   There are no trains or buses.   You can only access the facilityby car, either owned or rented.   This is where they launchrockets, satellites,   and test space shuttles.   That's the space shuttle assembly factory.    Over here is the launch site and lookout.    Each facility ismore than five kilometers apart.    That's how big this place is.    We will enter through the Visitor Center.    All general admissionhas to come in through here.    We'll buy the tickets,pass through security,    and then hop on the tour bus.    The other areas are off-limits,    so this must be the same routethe priest would take.    I don't know what he wants to do here,    but I believe he will spendthe remaining days until the new moon    somewhere inside the Space Center.    No more.    Due to security concerns,we are limiting the number of visitors.    Please wait in line.    Oh, but he's with me.    You'll let him slide, right?    Sure.    Now, come along.    You would've had to waitanother    minutes.    Are you a pastor? Or a priest?    I'm trying to do small acts of kindnessin my everyday life.    Are you a tourist?    Do clergymen have an interest in rockets?    You just seem out of place.    Actually, I kind of understand.God and space.    How symbolic.    Would you be offended if I askedif God was an alien?    Do I have to tolerateyour incessant questions?    You did a good deed,so you can leave me alone now.    If you're bored of waiting in line,go waste your time somewhere else.    I didn't come herejust to rush for    minutes.    Gravity is the biggest obstaclewhen launching a rocket.    Ideally, a rocket can launch most easily    if there is lessgravitational pull upon it.    That's why launching a rocketalong the equator      gives it an advantage over gravity.    This is becausethe Earth's centrifugal force    causes gravity to weakenalong the equator.    Athletes may be able to breaktheir records near the equator.    Something's wrong. I don't feel well.    In addition,the sea level of Cape Canaveral    has a unique characteristic.    The sea level is described as "zero mark"when measuring elevation.    However, recent studies have revealedthat the sea's surface is not always zero.    For example, in the Indian Oceanby the Maldives Archipelago,    the sea level curves downby about     meters.    On the other hand, the Sea of Japancurves up by    meters,    and Cape Canaveral is   meters above the zero mark.    This could be dueto inconsistencies in gravity.     Cape Canaveral is one such locationwith weaker gravity.    When tides are taken into account,    it is said that sea level may riseby upwards of     meters.    Cape Canaveral    is the most suitable locationon Earth for a rocket launch.    Yikes, it's cold.    What?    What the… What happened to my cola?    STAND NAME: Diver DownSTAND MASTER: NARCISO Anasui    So, Jolyne.    What is your plan?    Do you want to wait forthe Speedwagon Foundation and Mr. Jotaro?    Or do you want to keepgoing after the priest?    I…    Yes, we'll find him now.    Sorry, but we don't knowif your father will come in time.    He may not even come for two days.    Weather left the priest in shambles.    His allies are all down.    The timing is impeccable.    The only thing for sureis that if we don't hurry,    then we'd miss our chance.    Hey Emporio, what are you doing?    Cut that out.    Why did you stop the car?    I'm not trying to.    Hey! I said get the car moving.    This is a stolen car.    We are wanted criminals.That hasn't changed.    -Also, a kid is in the driver's seat.-That's not it.    The car's acting up!    -What is it?-I don't know, it suddenly slowed down!    Ermes, switch with him.    Hey…    What are those things?    What's going on?    Brace for impact!    What's happening?    Cars! What the hell is going on?    Did a bad crash cause an expl*si*n?    Emporio, pedal to the metal!We need to go!    I can't!    It won't move!    The road is collapsing!    No, the road is fine.    It's not collapsing,and the guardrails are intact.    There's no wind from an expl*si*n!    You might thinkI'm messing around, Jolyne,    but I'm holding on for my life.    This car… This is bad!    Get out! You need to go!This car isn't safe!    At this rate, we're going to fall!    We aren't falling down, but sideways!    What do you mean, we're falling?    The other cars fell already.    They slid down this roadas if it's a cliff!    The car is shaking!    The front tires are in the air!    Everyone, get out of the car!    Is this the priest's ability?    It's not the new moon yet.How could this be?    It's growing stronger,the force is pulling us sideways!    Get out of the car, hurry!    It's going to flip backwards!    We're falling not down, but sideways.    How far will we fall?    Jolyne! Don't let go of Emporio!    Diver Down!    Ermes!    Stone Ocean!    How far did you fall, Ermes?    How far did you go?    Jolyne, we're going to fall!    At this rate, we'll get hit by debris!    Jolyne, forget Ermes for now.    If she survives, she'll find us.    But…    We've almost reached him,    but you'd rather retreat than find him?    That's enough.    Jolyne, your body won't last!    How is this possible?    I can't believe this.    How can we fall sideways?    Don't we have the groundbecause of gravity?    This is what the priesthoped to accomplish.    This is the power my father sealedin Egypt    years ago.    This is what the priest called "heaven"!    Some trees aren't being uprooted.    Looks like the Visitor Centeris still in one piece.    Jolyne.    You said this is "heaven,"but this might just be the beginning.    I have this feeling thatthings will turn for the worse.    The priest is waiting for the new moon.    It plays a vital role in gravity,and the new moon is only    hours away.    Listen, Jolyne,Weather left the priest in a bad state.    I know firsthand that he's hurt.    Now's our chance to strike.He's the one who's cornered.    Let's climb this guardrailup to the Visitor Center.    You're sure the priest is this way?    Yes. He's up ahead.    Go, Jolyne.    Of course. My mind is made up.    That's right. Those eyes of yours, Jolyne.    Your face as you starefar into the distance.    That's what makes my heart race.    Let's go, Emporio.    Okay.    Right now, your heart    burns with the resolve to stop the priest.    At the same time, you're hopingyour father will come to save you.    I'm the one who can protect you,not Weather, nor Jotaro.    In time, you'll begin to wishthat you were in my arms.    In the beginning of all matter,there was gravity.    Even for this earth,    gravity was its beginning.    Gravity keeps the planets revolving.    Where shall I head on this earth now?    What is going to transpire?    To my body and mind…    and to the end of all things?    Someone!    Someone, save us!    What in the world is going on?    What is happening?    Help!    Someone, come save us!    -Anyone!-They're going to be all right.    No need to help them.    My phone doesn't have service.It can't reach a tower!    Why?    I can't even begin to guess.    Maybe my phone is busted.    It could also be causedby this gravity thing,    but I really don't know.    Anyway, I have no ideawhat's going on in other places.    Are rescue teams on their way?    This is the ticketing office box, Jolyne.    That's the entrance    to the Visitor Center.    Jolyne, the priest is still here, right?    Yes, he's close. He's almost within reach.    It's as if he was just here.    What?    This thing… it can't be!    But why? What happened to it?    Pale Snake.    No, The Green Baby!    The priest's Stand evolved!    Unbelievable!    Jolyne!    My right hand!    I came to finish you off now,    if you can't wait two days.    MARCH   ST,        :   A.M.       HOURS AND    MINUTES UNTIL THE NEW MOON
05x34 - C-Moon (1)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:42What's wrong with these eggs?  A Stand…  Pale Snake is no longer my Stand ability.  Something else is inside me… but what?  I feel terrible…  Something is running loose inside me.  This power, it's beyond my control.  But this power carries hope.  I can at least feelhope within this power.   Dio's memo inside Jotaro's memory…   It seems this power needsthe things in that memory.   Time and place.   North latitude,    degrees    minutes.   West longitude,    degrees    minutes.   That's where heaven will be.   This location is Cape Canaveral.   Kennedy Space Center.   In the beginning of all matter,there was gravity.   Even for this earth,   gravity was its beginning.   What's going on?   At this rate, we're going to fall!   We aren't falling down, but sideways!   Is this the priest's ability?   Jolyne! Don't let go of Emporio!   Diver Down!   Ermes!   Gravity keeps the planets revolving.   Where shall I head on this earth now?   What is going to transpire?   This is the power my father sealedin Egypt    years ago.   This is what the priest called "heaven"!   To my body and mind…   and to the end of all things?   That's the entrance to the Visitor Center…   Jolyne, the priest is still here, right?   Yes, he's close. He's almost within reach.   It's as if he was just here.   The priest's Stand evolved!   My right hand!   EPISODE   : C-Moon ( )   I came to finish you off now,   if you can't wait two days.   Jolyne Cujoh!   My arm is turning inside out!   -Jolyne!-Jolyne!   So you are the one who's beenhelping Jolyne this whole time.   Emporio, get behind Anasui!   Stone Ocean!   Jolyne, behind you!   I'll get rid of Jolyne Cujoh first.   Anasui, get over here. Hurry!   What is this Stand?   Your strands turned inside out!   It turned my spike inside out too!   That's where his fist touched,   but it was merely a scratch!   We have to stay away from his att*cks!   It must be gravity.Think of the events leading up to now!   The stand ability must berelated to gravity!   All matters including the Earth and applesare affected by gravity.   Gravity attracts mattertowards the center of mass!   That's the cosmic law!   This Stand ability alters gravityand changes its direction!   Anything that touches its fistturns inside out.   I don't know its range,but it makes everything fall sideways!   So that's how the weak gravityat Cape Canaveral   affected and evolved the priest's Stand!   Its powers are completely differentfrom Pale Snake's memory manipulation,   nor is it The Green Baby's powerof infinite division.   Jolyne, it's coming to strike again!   Go to Anasui, Emporio!   It took a hit!   Impossible!   My leg is inverting!   Jolyne!   This can't be!   Don't panic, Emporio.   You can relax.   If everything it touches turns inside out,   then I'll let it hit me againto revert my body back right side out.   Turn my body inside out…   and outwards again!   Jolyne!   Good grief.   Of course,   I have to stitch the wounds.   One thing is for certain now.   Every strike I deal leaves damage!   If I have to strike it downhere and now, then…   We have no time to waste.   Climb, Emporio.   Get to the guardrails.   I'm here as Jolyne's backup,not your babysitter!   I'm going!   Jolyne!   I already turned   this ticketing box office inside out!   The way it moves…    Judging by the powers,I thought it was an auto-tracking Stand,    but the att*cks are too accurate!    As if it knows that it's useless,    so it's no longer targetingmy arms and legs.    It's now aiming for my vitalslike my head and chest,    the only places that would be fatal!    It dodged my kickswith machine-like precision!    This Stand is a remote control type!    The priest's eyes are watching.    This Stand's att*cks are precisebecause the priest can see the fight!    Its att*cks only seem destructive    because its poweris amplified by gravity.     Where is he?I assumed he was hiding, but he's close!    He is close enough from hereto see us clearly!    Diver Down!    Stay down.    Anasui!    I said, I'll get rid of Jolyne first.    Anasui, Jolyne!    Stone Ocean!    Jolyne!    What did you do, Jolyne?    Anasui!You might be able to help yourself.    It's easy for you to jump on the pavement,    but for now, don't let go of my rope.    Your weight is choking our foe.The Stand is powerless!    Not only that, it doesn't havethe strength to break free!    Unbelievable!    It's trying to grab Jolyne's stringbefore it suffocates!    If it grabs Jolyne's rope with its hands…    The thread will turn inside outand disintegrate!    Jolyne, let go of its neck.    I did this to free you from its grasp!    No, Anasui. I have to face it now.    Our chance is now,with the rope around its neck!    I'm not trying to strangle it.    I'll close in and finish it off!    What are you saying, Jolyne?    If it grabs a hold of this rope,    it will invert your thread.    Then your arm will get inverted as well!    Damn you!    I'll reach you in no time, just you wait!    No matter what I say, Jolyne won't listen.    We're in a horrible situation.    f*ck it!    If you're finishing it off, then be quick!    Hurry up and break free!    Ah, he grabbed her rope!    No, I still have time.    My threadwill stay intact just a moment longer!    STAND NAME: C-MoonSTAND MASTER: FATHER PUCCHI    This is Sigma Team.    It's no good, we can't go any further.    The t*nk flipped over!    Get any closer to the Visitor Center,    and the t*nk flips upside down!    What do you mean, "the t*nk flips?"    Report!    It's just as I said.    The t*nk flips over!    Some force is flipping the t*nk over.    We can't figure it out.    Please send scientists or expertsto investigate.    Don't try to figure it out.    Our mission is to rescue the victims!    Still, we really have no ideawhat's going on.    We don't know if there are survivors,or how big the affected area is.    The entire place is a mess.    What is going on?    It's as if a hammer fell from the skyand pounded onto the ground,    and turned the area into a scrapyard!    This is J-Hawk  .    I have vision on the center.It's three kilometers away.    Attempting to locate the survivors.    What the hell?    Which way is up?    Mayday!    J-Hawk  ?    J-Hawk  !    What happened? Do you copy?    J-Hawk  , do you copy?    This is our opportunityto defeat the priest's Stand!    But this is too risky!    Jolyne's arm is getting shredded!    Don't waste your time!    Hurry up and finish it off!    Stone Ocean!    It's inverting the steel platingto stand itself up!    Hurry! Hurry up and finish it!    This is hopeless,it's almost all the way up!    It ripped more tiles off!    It grabbed her string!    Jolyne, let go of it!    You have to run!Your arm will get shredded!    Diver Down!    I submerged Diver Down into the rope.    And now, instead of Jolyne's rope,    my body will turn inside out!    Anasui.    Get it, Jolyne. As long as your stringis wrapped around its neck,    I won't let it get up!    -Anasui!-Now go! End this fight, Jolyne!    After all, it was in my best interestto get rid of you when I had the chance.    When you were in prison,at the very beginning.    Jesus bore the fate of being crucified.    Mary, Mother of Jesus,was fated to lose her son.    To achieve happiness,humans must bear a curse,    and overcome fate.    The trial Dio and I had to overcomewas Joestar's bloodline.    This can't be…    The priest is here!    I have come to save my Stand,which is still undergoing evolution.    What?    My body is rising towards the sky!    I am the center of gravity.    Gravity is reversed wherever I stand.    The closer you come to me,the stronger the gravity gets.    The last step is to bide my timeuntil my ability fully evolves.    It will harness even greater power,    not the little strength it has now.    Anasui, pull on her rope!    I'm trying already!    Listen closely, my Stand.    I'll say this again. Invert her only once.    Do not strike more than once.    The att*ck to a vital areais more devastating    than one to the arms or body.    Remember, a single punch will do.    Splendid.We shall return to the Visitor Center.    What?    The fight is over.    Jolyne can no longer feel painor even think.    Her heart was turned inside out,    reversing the blood flow to her brain.    Anasui, pull her close!    Hurry, draw her in!    Jolyne's strings…    No…    This can't be happening!    Jolyne!    This ability,    I shall name it C-Moon.    Invincibility.    Did I gain invincibilitybefore the new moon?    However, my ultimate goaldoes not lie in simply achieving strength.    I shall remind myself that my pursuitis the happiness of all human beings.    Jolyne Cujoh is no more than a casualty,    just like Weather and the prisonerswhose lives were sacrificed.    To successfully achieve a goal,    trial and sacrifice is inevitable.    I don't believe this.    What should I do, Jolyne?    What happened just now…    No, this can't be happening!    What's that?    Where is that sound coming from?    It's the phone!    It didn't have a signal a moment ago.    I got a new message.    Who is it from?    My calls aren't going through.    The gravitational anomaly seems tohave sent a satellite out of orbit.    Are you Emporio?    I don't know exactly what's going on,    but I can sense that my daughterand the priest have met.    Could this be…    Is this him?    Is this message from…    Jolyne is alive.    But she's not safe.    Protect Jolyne.    Just until I arrive… that's all I ask.    She must have discovered how tocounter his gravity.    That's the only wayshe could have survived.    She's alive, but just barely.    Jotaro Kujo.    It's Mr. Jotaro!    He's nearby!    I don't believe this.    Jolyne is alive!    That means…    No, this can't be!    Anasui, find Jolyne!    Jolyne isn't dead!    What?    But the priest knows too,    because he must've sensedthat she's alive!    What did you do, Jolyne Cujoh?    Your heart was turned inside out!    Gravity imploded your heart!    How could she still be alive?    How did she manage to survive?    We must settle the score.    The Joestar bloodline must be overcome!    Diver Down!    Where are you going?    Isn't it obvious?    The best way to protect Jolyneis to k*ll that priest!    MARCH   ST,        :   AM       HOURS AND    MINUTES UNTIL THE NEW MOON

EPISODE   : C-Moon ( )   Jolyne… I sense she isin no condition to move.   How did she survive?   Could it be that I missed her vitals?   No.   Without a doubt,my Stand struck her heart.   I was certain of it.   Could it be Joestar's blood,   the bloodline of Kujo?   Is it getting in the way of Dio and me,once again?   I absolutely must finish offJolyne Cujoh here.   Both in prison and in Orlando,Jolyne Cujoh interfered.   She's a trial that I must overcometo achieve my purpose.   Have confidence, Father Pucchi.   Fate will choose to side with me.   Dio and I have a purpose much granderthan their pitiful sense of justice.   Not a single human can hinder my plans!   Hey you…   Call a doctor.   What happened to my hip bone?   Help me!   I'm close. I'm very close.   Jolyne Cujoh fell near here.   She's here.That's a piece of Jolyne's clothing.   Jolyne went inside this building.   By the way, do not comea single step closer to me.   Stand back.I don't even count you as an obstacle.   Retreat, C-Moon!   That man is not Anasui!   Diver Down can submerge in more placesthan just the walls or the ground.   I found a tourist who d*edfrom your gravity ability,   and changed his bone structureto match mine.   You're already within my range.   Take this! Diver Down!   I missed!   He turned his own face inside out.   To me, you're merely a pesky flyI can easily swat away.   She touched my face.   That was Jolyne Cujoh's hand.   She's on the move.   What is she planning to do?   How is she able to move?   That's blood.   She is wounded, without a doubt.   My heart tells me to track her down,no matter what.   I will end her, right here and now!   Jotaro Kujo will be here any minuteto rescue Jolyne Cujoh.   If Anasui rejoins the fight,the battle will be difficult.   Jolyne Cujoh's allies are headed this way   in hopes to save her life.   Hence it is now,   I must vanquish you, once and for all.   Your death   shall crush the resolve and hopesof your allies who have gathered here.   Especially Jotaro,who will lose his daughter.   His purpose and resolve in lifeshall vanish along with Jolyne.   He will no longer be a matchfor Dio and me.   I must finish her off, here and now!   I will find you, no matter the cost!   Come out, Jolyne Cujoh!   Show yourself!   Jolyne Cujoh!   It's only her thread.   Dammit, she's behind me!   I will give it my allto k*ll you right here!   I know that you are wounded!    I am the center of gravity,so if I turn my body upside down,    everything will fall toward my feet.    C-Moon!    Both strikes landed!    Both your arms are now useless!    Those strange shapes…    Why didn't her arms turn inside out?    How could this be?    Show yourself, Jolyne Cujoh!    You cannot run from your fate!    What is that thing?    What is that?    What's the shape of that thing,where her heart should be?    Stone Ocean!    Mobius strips?    Is that what you're creating?    STAND NAME: STONE OCEANSTAND MASTER: JOLYNE CUJOH    Start tracing its surface with a finger,    and keep going.    Follow the surfacewithout lifting the finger.    Before long, you have traced both sides.    You will be back at your starting point.    This non-orientable shapewas discovered in the   th century    by a German mathematician.    It is called "Mobius strip,"after his name.    The back side existsonly if there is a front side.    If there's no front and back,there's no turning inside out.    A non-orientable infinity strip    can be made with thread!    Is that what she created?    Did she make a Mobius stripthe instant she was struck?    I admire the first humanwho tried to eat mushrooms.    They risked poisoning themselves.    Was he a fool who happened to get lucky?    Otherwise,    was the discovery drivenby his desperate starvation?    Would you survive if I strike your head?    A single hit will do.    Which angle would be best?    A single hit to the head is all it takes.    Is this all you've got?    I'm disappointed.    Come at me with everything you got!    No.    I'm waiting for a definitive moment.    I've been circling you, containing myself.    I'm waiting forthe perfect moment to strike.    Do you understand?    The more I walk around,    the more these objects fall.    That's why I'm waiting.    I'm waiting for victoryto fall into my hands.    Do you understand?    Is your Mobius strip enough to save you,    considering your wounds?    There it is.The chance I've been waiting for!    A security officer's corpse!    It's in my hand!    Jolyne!    -sh*t!-Whoa!    Dammit.    Jolyne!    Jolyne!    What?    The Speedwagon Foundation    sh*t this harpoon from the skythree kilometers above.    It was aimed to landon the Visitor Center's premises.    I made a copy of it with my sticker,and duplicated the harpoon.    When the sticker is removed,the copy flies back to the original.    I clung on to the harpoon,so that despite your gravity,    I can be pulled up here in an instant.    Then, I used my Standto break it into pieces.    We came to this spotwhere he felt her presence.    Dad…    Jotaro Kujo and Ermes!    You're surrounded, Father Pucchi.    Completing your Stand in    hourswas just your wishful thinking.    It's over.    You have no allies left.    You will be defeated beforethe new moon arrives!    You're mistaken, Emporio.    As I thought, fate…    gives me trials, yet sides with me.    The ones who will aid mein attaining my powers    are the Joestar descendants!    After being stuck underthis steel framing,    I now understand!    My allies were the Kujos all along!    What the hell?He's rising up towards the sky!    I am the center of gravity.    I understand now, Dio!    This is the answer.    I have no need to wait another    hoursfor the new moon to arrive.    I need the gravitational forceof the new moon.    Then I'll just float higher in the sky    and find an areawith equal gravitational pull.    I'll put myself where there is gravityequal to that of the new moon!    There must be an exact spotthat can complete C-Moon's power!    You think we'll let you get away?    You don't know when to surrender, do you?    Stay calm, look for the exact location.    Count the prime numbersand maintain my composure.    -Thirteen, seventeen…-That bastard is muttering something!    Gravity hasn't changed!    It's still pulling us sideways.    Ermes, look to your right.    Pick up the g*n he dropped.    You've grown, Jolyne.    Hold onto the guardrails.    Ermes,    pick up the g*n and sh**t him.    C-Moon!    Star Platinum: The World!    You wish to use your Standto deflect the b*ll*ts.    Time can stay stopped fora maximum of five seconds.    You will not see this harpoon.    Once the time starts again,    the harpoon will impale you.    Three seconds.    Two seconds.    One second.    Time will now start.    What just happened?    The harpoon missed.    He dodged during my time stop.    That priest…    He's unharmed.    He's opening the hatch.    It looks like he's trying to board it.    The Space Shuttle is in the air!    The priest is insidethe exhibition Shuttle!    He dodged the harpoon, but how?    Damn…    he's not only trying to get away.    Don't tell me…    he learned somethingthat he shouldn't have,    a condition that will allow himto complete his Stand!    It is you who broughtthis Pucchi to heaven.    All this time, even in prison,my allies were you.    Father in heaven,    guide me!    Watch over me,    that I shall not stray from my path.    I give myself to thee!    Yes, I feel it!    The position! It's here!

You, the Joestar bloodline,helped me reach heaven!   Look!   It's Anasui!   He's found his wayonto the Shuttle's outer shell!   Eat this! Diver Down!   My ability is no longer C-Moon.   At last, the time for heaven has come.   My ability is complete!   The power of gravity   radiates throughout my body!   Rot in hell,   you scumbag!   It's news at noon.   The incident on the State Road    at Cape Canaveral   has accounted for  ,    casualties.   It was originally believed to becaused by road cave-ins,   however, there seems to beother underlying causes.   Helicopters have crashed,and rescue missions have failed.   We will continue to reportafter the break.   Where are we?   What was that?   Where's Anasui?   What is going on?   Where's Anasui?   Are you worried about me, Jolyne?   I'm touched that you care about me.   But first, we need to find the priest.   He was engulfed by light,and I lost sight of him.   We have to find the Space Shuttle, now!   The Shuttle is right over there.   The Shuttle hasn't moved,   but we have.   We shifted about     metersfrom where we were.   Just a moment ago,   we were on the other sideof that building.   I hate to point this out, Jotaro,   but I didn't feel any impactmoving us here.   Did anyone see anything?   We must have been blasted to this sideby the reversed gravity.   The direction of gravitywent back to normal a moment ago.   Besides, Pucchi saidhe no longer has C-Moon.   Jolyne, where is the priest?   Can you sense where he is?   I can sense that he's close,but that's about it.   His location and directionare undetectable.   I can't tell.   What bothers me more   is how Pucchi saw my harpoon.   He eyed the Star Platinum harpoonin stopped time.   He saw the harpoon, so he evaded it.   But how?   I get it now.   The priest was just talking nonsense.   The time of heaven,completing his Stand, whatever!   He was just bluffing.   He just used trickery to deceive us,so that he can hide.   He thinks he can completely lose us now.   Ermes,   it's in your best interestnot to step in there.   -What?-Stay in an open area.   This rain will soon…   I'm… drenched.   What's going on, guys?    Ermes?    What are you doing?    It's this a*t*matic door!    It's super fast!    What the hell?    It's snapping shut like a hydraulic press!    I'm dry.    I was soaked a moment ago.    What the hell is going on?    Watch your head, Ermes.    What?    It's time for the evening news.    We have a developing story    on the State Road     incidentat Cape Canaveral.    Oh? Um, my apologies.    I almost skipped the break.    Wait, the break ended already?    The sun…It's dusk!    Well, can I have chocolate nuts, caramel,    strawberry chocolate chips, and mint?    Oh, and top it off with orange vanilla.    That'll be six dollars.    What the…    Strike!    Wow, look at this rookie go!    He's been named our MVP!    Oh, am I actually that good?    The tissue hardened.    Ouch…    It's stuck to my nose!    Barry, go graba   -kilogram chunk of meat.    On it, boss.    He finally got a hit!    Unfortunately, it's a pitcher's fly!    What happened?    He's bleeding like crazy!    How did his blood get everywhere?    We lost control!    We're crashing at top speed!    But the readings are all within range!    We're dead.    Pull up!    What was that?    What in the world is happening?    Ermes!    It wasn't a bluff.    The priest wasn't just telling liesto get away.    And my blood…    I haven't stopped bleeding,    but my blood is already dry.    Fresh blood is drying up!    Jolyne, look at the blood on your face.    It's drying up and crusting!    You're right.    What could be causing this?    This can't be…    It must have started at that moment!    The priest has been executing his abilitysince he was in the Shuttle!    All things are movingat an incredible speed!    Everything in this world,    not only man-made things,but things in nature too!    The sun is already down!    The stars are beginning to come out!    Is this his completed ability?    STAND NAME: STAR PLATINUMSTAND MASTER: JOTARO KUJO    What in the world is going on?    This is caused bythe priest's new ability.    sh*t!    The stars and the clouds are drifting    like special effects in a movie!    Is this the priest'sfully developed ability?    There's more.    Time. It's accelerating!    Time is passing faster and faster!    In this situation, is he the only one?    What if no one else can function    in the flow of this accelerated time?    That's highly likely.    When he dodged my harpoon,    he may have done so unconsciously.    But what if he can keep upwith this accelerated time?    What if he realized what he's capable of?    Jolyne, we can't stay here.    It's dangerous.It's not safe to be here like this.    -No…-Do you sense him too, Jolyne?    -Do you sense his presence?-What?    Where is he?    He's on the move.    I can't tell his exact position,    but he's approaching us from the shadows!    This is bad, we need to go.    Everyone, get moving! Quickly!    Star Platinum: The World!    My ability's duration is shortened!    This is bad!    This way, Jotaro!    You…    -Your name is Anasui, correct?-That's right.    My Stand is called Diver Down.    It can submerge into various surfaces.    Let's go look out at the other side.    Yeah. But considering his speed,being on the lookout may not help much.    By the way, Jotaro…    I will do everything I canto protect your daughter.    Yes, things may seem desperate,    but we'll make it out of this fight.    So please, allow meto take your daughter's hand in marriage.    What did you just say?    I said, please give me your permission.    Jotaro, let me marry your daughter.    I know this isn't the right time,but all I want is your blessing.    If only I had your permission,then I can be at peace.    I don't really believethat Jolyne would marry me.    It's true that I've beensentenced for m*rder,    and I also know thatJolyne would never fall for me.    But the strong drive and mindthat she inherited from you    sheds light into the darkness of my heart.    She lightened my heart,which was on the verge of collapsing!    Please, I need it now.    Just one word will do.    Say you'll allow me.    Please liberate my heart.    If we make it out of this alive,allow me to marry her!    I don't understand.    Have you lost your mindfrom all this madness?    Anasui.    We need to stay together.    Everyone, don't wander off.    We made it up on the roof,but now we have nowhere to run.    Besides, he's on the move.    But I can't sense his movement.    I barricaded the area with my strings,but who knows what good it'll do?    Though the priest succeededin completing his ability,    he has no intention of letting us live.    He wants to settle his score with us.    He is determined    to settle the scorewith the Joestar bloodline.    I get it,but his Stand is too unpredictable!    How are we supposed to fight against it?    Jotaro, allow us!    Everyone, listen closely.    It may appear as if we are cornered,    but coming up to this roofgave us an advantage.    The priest's ability accelerates time.    He's the only one who can move insidethe accelerated time.    However, we can still see him.    Judging from my watch,    it takes about two minutesfor an hour to pass.    This is what it means.    If he runs at    kilometers per hour,    he'll appear as if he's movingat the speed of a b*llet train.    It sounds fast, but our eyescan observe a moving b*llet train.    Stay calm and observe.    You will be able to tellthat he's moving, at least.    Try to sense his movements.    He's    times faster than us.    A car going   kph would be  ,   kph,    and a car going    kph would be Mach  . .    Correct.    However, the priest is wary    and remains cautiousin coming to this rooftop.    He knows that I can stop time,though only for a few seconds.    There's also the unknown factor.    We don't knowwhat his ability will become.    He himself is yearning to see it evolve.    Star Platinum: The World.    Where is he?    Where did he go?    I saw something move under that table.    He's closing in on us.    I can stop time for five seconds at most.    In just five seconds,I must find him and finish him off.    Good grief, he's nowhere to be found.    Did I just imagine a flickering shadow?    Time's up.    Time will now start again…    The palm tree!    He hid behind the leaves!    What?    No way. He's using the tree's flexibility!    My ability is at its limit.Time will start again!    He'll catapult himself using the tree!    Above?    Dad…    Jolyne, behind you!    He's coming again!    Anasui.    You submerged your Stand into my body.    You took damage in my place.    You served as armorto mitigate the damage.    And yet…    It's too short.    Five seconds just isn't enough.    I can't activatemy Time Stop ability consecutively!     Once Star Platinum stops timefor five seconds,    it can't launch for a brief moment.    Our only chance to defeat the priestis for me to get in range.    And only when the time is stopped!    I'm at the limit.    Time now starts again.    Dad! Anasui!    My first target is no longer Jotaro,but Anasui.    Yes, I will finish him off first.    Listen closely.    This may be beyond your comprehension,    but I will part with this last remark.    Time will accelerate.    I did not obtain this powerto end your lives,    nor does this ability promise mesupreme strength.    This power's purpose is to guidethe human race towards true happiness.    My new Stand, my new ability.    I shall give it a name.    Made in Heaven!

My new Stand, my new ability.   I shall give it a name.   Made in Heaven!   EPISODE   : Made in Heaven ( )   You're being eliminatedfor the future I envision.   Your impending death   is merely a sacrificefor humanity to achieve happiness.   g*n ghost!   It's useless, Emporio.   sh**ting him won't do any good.   No, Jolyne.   I sh*t at the building near us!   Ermes put her sticker on the b*llet.   The b*llet is duplicated!   Emporio, you…   He's coming at us again!   Hold on tight, everyone!   No matter what, don't let go!   It's him! He's chasing us on foot!   My Stand's speed is excludedfrom the time acceleration!   He'll catch up in no time!   Emporio, put a sticker on the next b*lletand sh**t again!   We have to reach the swamp,   to the ocean!   If we're at the ocean,then we might have a chance!   The priest caught up to us!   He's getting ahead to stand in our way!   sh**t another b*llet,and change our direction, Emporio!   It's the ocean!I see the rocks in the swamp!   Aim the next sh*t atthose protruding rocks!   He's coming for us again!   He's simply too fast!   Listen closely.He's moving with accelerated time,   but one Stand is all he's got!   Plus, its combat strengthis above average at best!   He can only att*ck one of us at a time.   That's the key to our victory.   Jotaro, I'll send you a signalthe moment I get att*cked.   Seize that opportunity to stop timeand finish him off!   The moment his att*ck hits me,that's when you stop the time.   Do you understand?   Don't do it before I'm hit,it has to be after.   It'll be a split of a second.   You must be absolutely precise.   Grab him and end his life.   Our only chance is your Star Platinum!   Wait a minute.   We're doing what?   I don't understand.   Smart plan, Anasui.   Although he proclaimedthat you are his first target,   that may not be the case.   It would make most senseif he targeted me first.   No, I've already submerged Diver Downinto your body,   so that it can protect youfrom the inside.   You're not the only one.   Jolyne, Emporio, and Ermes too.   Diver Down has submerged into everyonegiven our close distance.   In other words, no matterwho gets att*cked first,   Diver Down will feel the damage.   What?   You will sense my signalinternally through Diver Down.   Remember, don't stop timeuntil after I'm hit.   Anasui, you're willingto trade your life for his!   That's absurd!   His next att*ck will be deadly!   Maybe so.   But maybe I can signal Jotarobefore the blow kills me?   I've been lucky recently.   Wouldn't you say so, Emporio?   I've been lucky since the jailbreak.At least I haven't d*ed yet!   If I actually live through this,I might even ask Jolyne to marry me!   I'm just saying.   That's fine by me.   That's fine, Anasui.   Ask me to marry you.   I'm not saying thatbecause I'm in despair at our situation.    Your idea carries hope.There's no darkness there.    We may only have one chance.    If there's even a glimpse of hope there,    then I know it's the correct path for us.    There he is!    He's already on that rock! Emporio!    Get close to me!    You need to be closer!    He's coming!    Approaching from the right!    Brace yourselves!    This makes sense. The water gives him awayand tells us his position.    Not yet, Jotaro.    Don't stop time yet.    If you miss him, it's over.    You absolutely have to grab him!    Feel my signal from within.    Oh… wait.    See that? Look at the clouds!    They're zooming by like rockets!    And what exactly is going on?    The sky is brighter to the east!    Why? It's still too early!    It should take two or three minutesfor an hour to pass!    That means it takes    to    minutesfor the night to pass.    I don't believe this!    The sun is risingat an unbelievable speed!    Time is accelerating faster than before!    Around the world, birds are flyingat their normal speed.    Similarly, insects and plantshaven't changed their speed.    Flowers aren't blooming faster,nor are they wilting in an instant.    Look closely.    I have a glass cup in my hand.    When the cup is in my hand,nothing happens to it.    But the moment I let go,    the cup falls faster than we can see.    It's shattered on the groundbefore we realize it.    The only logical explanationis the acceleration of time!    Everything in the universe isaccelerating except for living things!    This is all my assistants' fault!    I'm the top-selling manga artist!    A genius like me drawingno more than one page a night?    That's absurd!    The ink dries beforeI can draw a single line!    What in the world am I supposed to do?    Hello?    What? One artist is stillmeeting deadlines?    Who is he?    Who the hell is he?    It's Rohan Kishibe.    What?    I can't see the wavesbecause of the accelerated time!    We can't tell where he is!    Where will he ambush us from?    Get ready!    Stone Ocean!    Kiss!    Jotaro, hold off on your ability.    Wait for my signal!    Now! Stop the time--    Star Platinum: The World!    You're mine!    Meet your end, Pucchi--    How is this possible?    Pucchi made Jolyne's Standatt*ck Anasui!    I'm one step behind!    Four seconds left.    If I don't k*ll him now,    he'll vanishin the accelerated time again.    It'll be over if time starts again!    I must end this fightbefore time restarts!    Three seconds left.    Two seconds!    Knives, suspended in air!    The priest had already thrown the knives,just as Dio once did!    You were two steps behind.    STAND NAME: Made in HeavenSTAND MASTER: ENRICO PUCCHI    The Joestar family,through their bloodline,    have seized victories bydrawing strength from honor and courage.    However!    Your bloodline is also your weakness.    Jotaro Kujo,your weakness is your daughter.    Dad…    Jolyne…    I stole a car…    on the way home from school…    at a supermarket parking lot…    I stole a car… Why did I do that?    But… I knew that you'd come and save me.    You'd do whatever it takes… to save me…    Dad, you…    I must bring all loose ends to a close.    I do not feel remorse,nor can I let you run freely.    I must settle every matter.    After all, I am the onewho k*lled your mother.    Emporio.    Yes, sh**t.    At least you may die a martyr's death.    Your fate ends here, Emporio!    Jolyne Kujo!    Ah!    Joestar!    Do you think you can escape me?    You swim even slower than you run.    Jolyne!    I caught a dolphin with Stone Ocean.    Yes, time may be accelerating,but living things are unaffected.    Now, Father Pucchi…you're against this speed!    How long will it take for you to catch up?    The distance is at play here.    Had we been closer,you may have been able to catch up.    But how far can you swim?    Is it     meters, or    ?    Can you stay underwater    and swim longer than a dolphinwithout letting out?    Time acceleration doesn't affect    the distance you can swim,or the stamina that you have!    Moreover, can you swim this distanceback to shore without drowning?    You will not escape!    I shall end your life!    I refuse to carry this feudinto the future!    Jolyne, the rope!    Hurry, come to the dolphin!    Emporio…    Because Anasui sacrificed himselfto protect my father,    I'm still alive, though barely.    Because Ermes gave her lifeto att*ck the priest,    I had enough timeto grab onto the dolphin.    When a dolphin lets a human rideon its back,    it swims to shorein the safest way possible.    Hurry, please!    Come!    Why is the rope getting longer?    That dolphin will take you to safety.I know it will.    What are you saying? Hurry and join me!    Emporio, I can't join you.    The priest can sense the Joestar in me.    No matter where I go, I sense him,and he senses me to track me down.    If I'm with you, you can't get away.    Emporio, you have to facethe path that lies ahead alone.    But don't worry.    I know you can finishwhat we set out to do.    Those who wished for your escapewere Anasui, Ermes,    and my father, Jotaro Kujo.    You have to survive. You are our hope.    I told you, I don't understand!    No, you can't…    Stop, wait! Jolyne!    No!    Pull the rope!    He ought to be tired out by now.    I'll hold him off!    Face me, Father Pucchi!    Stone Ocean!    Jolyne!    What's that in the sky?    Could that be the sun?    It's already morning!    The sun isn't round.It looks like it's stretching out!    The needles on my watch vanished…    No, it's ticking so fast,I can't see them with my eyes!    It's night time again.    Morning!    It's night again!    What's happening?    It's accelerating.    Time is accelerating even more!    Oh, damn!    We need canned foods!    Raw foods are rotting away.    Hoard whatever canned food you can find!    We're running out of food!    Dust is collecting!The window frames are rusting!    My implants!    I just got these done the other day!    What is happening to the sky?    Where's the sun?    Is that gleaming light the sun?    Is it night, or is it day?What year are we in?    What is today's date?    I feel cold.    The seasons are changing!    What is that?    The waves are eroding the rocks away!    Is there no way to stoptime from accelerating?    How much more?    Is there an end to this?    The land formation changed!    Where am I?    There are only live organisms here!    I can't breathe…    What the hell? Why are you naked here?    Huh? But I was just…    Hurry up!    Put your jumpsuits on!    Why don't I have clothes on?    Wait… what was I doing?Time got faster and I…    Crap! I'm on camera!    It's going to get misunderstood!    This is…    This place…    I know where this is!    This is Green Dolphin Street Prison!    This is the hallwayby the visitation room!
05x38 - What a Wonderful WorldQuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:44This place…  This is Green Dolphin Street Prison!  This is the hallwayby the visitation room!  What the hell do you want?  I don't want to see your face.  It's too late to comeand try to act like a father!  I want to help you.  I'll get you out of here shortly.  Shut up.   You know you can't.   I'll serve this two-year sentencefor that hit-and-run and then be released.   Calm down. I've always thought of you--   That's a blatant lie.It's too late to play father figure now.   Now leave!   Who are these two?   They look so similar…   to the Joestars!   But it's not them.   Leave! I can't get along with you.   What is going on?   Wasn't I at Cape Canaveral?   And what's going on?   What year am I in?   It's     , November   th.   Pucchi!   Who the hell are you?   Even a priest isn't allowedto disrupt a visitation--   It's     ?   Did time rewind?   On the contrary.   We leapt through   to the ultimate timebeyond the acceleration.   We went beyond the end of our universe.   The ending of one universe brings aboutthe beginning of the next.   This is an inevitable truth,and in the forthcoming universe,   the Earth is created, and living thingsexperience a life similar to the previous.   The human race went beyond the endand now faces the dawn of a new start.   This is the new world   Made in Heaven has promised!   What are you saying?   There's no Jolyne Cujoh in this world.   Neither are there Jotaro,Anasui, or Ermes.   Even their souls ceased to exist.   The dead cannot be brought over.   Those who lost their livesduring the time acceleration   have been weeded out of the cycle.   I left behind all my enemiesin the prior universe.   Except for you, Emporio!   You should not have made it over.   You must be ended, here and now!   EPISODE   : IT'S A WONDERFUL WORLD   Code    . Security Level  .   Visitation room door alarm activated.   Code    . Security Level  .   What's going on?   Who knows, but now's our chance. Let's go.   They're leaving the roomjust like Jolyne and Jotaro did.   They're different people,but the same thing is happening!   This is fate.   This universe   has been through the same historyas that of the prior world.   It will remain in the same course.   Fate is brought on by necessity,not chance.   Now, you're going totry to find refuge in your room.   I'm talking about your old secret room   that you used to hide inback in the prior world.   Your next actionsare written in your destiny.   I have to go somewhereother than the ghost room!   How did prisoners get insidethe general area?   Who knows? Just run.   Those guards are from earlier.   They're going to trip over.   What is it?   -We'll trip over.-What?   We keep running in this direction,and we'll trip over ourselves horribly.   Huh? What the hell are you on about?   That's odd. Why did I think of that?   I don't know, it just came to me.We're going to trip over.   Are you chickening out?   If we don't hurry, they'll cut our pay!   -Why?-Right!   For some reason, I know.   Those two are about to…   Father!   -What's the matter?-Move.   No one can escape fate.   You will escape to that room.   What exactly is going on?   We leapt through   to the ultimate timebeyond the acceleration.   We went beyond the end of our universe.   The end of our universe?   I've read it in a book once.   How the universe begins and ends.   From the moment it is born,a universe infinitely expands.   But at a certain point in time,it begins to contract.   Like a stress ball being squeezed,   there's a point of singularitywhere it can no longer contract.   That marks the end of the universe.    The force leads to a Big Bang,forming a brand new universe.    Did we come from our world to this one?    Did we travel through Earth's historyat an incredible speed,    and now we're in the new     ?    But not everyone made it.    The dead cannot be brought over.    Those who lost their livesduring the time acceleration    have been weeded out of the cycle.    They're gone.    Jolyne and everyone,they're not part of this world.    I've become alone again.    Blessed are those who leapt through time.    They've experienced everythingthat is to come    and have arrived in this new universe.    This is the worldwhere fate is predestined.    Fate will repeat itself.    When people meet, it's like gravity.    Fate dictates one to meet another.    For example,what lies five years in the future?    Having gone through the accelerated time,    we know what will happen.    When do accidents happen,and when do we fall ill?    When will our life end?    When do we meet, and when do we part?    When and who do we love and hate?    When do we have children,and what lies in their future?    When do wars break out,and when does a new era begin?    As if watching a movie,the future events play out in our minds.    So shall it be for our children,and their posterity!    The time acceleration startedat Cape Canaveral.    Every living being thatlived through this acceleration    can recall the future.    It won't be with their mind or body,but with their soul!    And that in itself isthe meaning of happiness,    because now,we can prepare for the future.    Blessed are those who prepared!    One may say that to learn ofa bleak future will bring despair.    I say otherwise.    Should you die tomorrow,    the mere knowledge ofwhat is to come brings peace.    Preparation overcomes despair.    Humanity will evolve.    This is the path to heavenDio and I sought to achieve!    This is Made in Heaven.    The g*n! My g*n!    I dropped it in the ocean!    If I turn right and go down the stairs,I'll get to my ghost room.    But Pucchi already knowsabout the secret room.    I shouldn't turn right.    I'll turn left and find another place.    Some details may vary,but you cannot change fate.    Your only optionis to escape into that cr*ck.    Suppose I spare your lifeand you go off on your way.    Eventually, you will stand against me.    That's the destined future.    I must eliminate you here and now.    Even without Jolyne,you'll break out of here.    Fate dictates that I lose youat Cape Canaveral.    But here in this prison,before the acceleration starts,    I know exactly what you'll do.    This is my chanceto eradicate an opposing force.    Hence, I slowed time down on this date.    Prepare to meet your end.    Bracing for the inevitablebrings joy, Emporio.    You are our hope!    Your death shall serve humanity!    Die now, Emporio!    Fate is predestined and can't be changed?    Then…    I'll let you change my fate.    Your arm inserted it into my headwhen you punched me into the cr*ck.    When you k*lled Weather,    he extracted his ability,Weather Report, in a disc.    Jolyne wanted me to have it.    She gave me this disc!    Perish in the name of God!    Emporio, your futile actions…    You've merely turned your screamsinto the trumpets of hell!    Yes, the ability is now yours.    However, Weather was skilledin using his power!    It's not an ability you can masterby simply inserting it in your head!    And now!    Time…    accelerates once again!    Learn your feeble place, Emporio…    in the face of my grand purpose!    What?    What is the meaning of this?    I cannot… stand!    Something is terribly wrong.    What is this?    Weather Report!    I read it in a book once.    Oxygen is the most prevalent toxinthat surrounds living organisms.    Yes, living beings need oxygen to live,    but it can't surpass   % saturation.    Pure oxygen is highly toxic.
