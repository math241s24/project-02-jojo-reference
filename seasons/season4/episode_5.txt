Did you just say Dio?josu: That's the guy Jotaro talked about.kei: Let me tell you a bit about the past,main: ,Josuke Higashikata.kei: After all, you're not completely uninvolved.kei: Everything happened eleven years ago, in .kei: At the time, I was seven, and Okuyasu was four.kei: We lived in Tokyo.kei: The world was carefree,thanks to the bubble economy,kei: but at the time, my dad had no luck.kei: Our mom d*ed of an illness,kei: the business that my dad was running went under,Luxury_Houses_Ni,sign: Luxury HousesNijimura Landkei: and he was in massive debt.kei: He would hit us for no reason all the time.kei: Our dad was a total loser.kei: But then, suddenly,kei: money started rolling in to my dad.kei: Even jewels and precious metals, too, sometimes.kei: He wasn't even really working.kei: I found out later when I did some researchkei: that my dad had apparently already sold his soul to Dio.kei: He became one of his minions in exchange for money.kei: It seems that Dio was looking for anyone with Stand potential back then.kei: Somehow, he found out that my dad had the potential,kei: though I have no idea now what his Stand was like.kei: But one day... Even though it was ten years ago, I still remember it vividly.kei: When I got home from school, around : PM...kei: Okuyasu!kei: Did Dad hit you again? That scum!oku: N-No!kei: Huh?dad: Dio...dad: Dio's dead...flashback: ,That has to be why!kei: Dad?kei: Dad, let's call an ambulance.dad: It's no use! This isn't an illness!flashback: ,The flesh bud has gone berserk!dad: I'm done for!fboverlap,kei: Dad!kei: About a year after that, he becamea glob of flesh that can't even tellmain: ,that we're his sons anymore.kei: Dio would implant his own cells into the heads of those he couldn't trust,kei: and order them around whenhe wanted to control them.kei: Dad had one of those flesh buds implanted in his head.kei: I spent ten years researching everything.kei: About Stands, about Jotaro...main: ,Then I found out about the old woman named Enyaba,main: ,and obtained the bow and arrow.kei: But as I learned all of this,main: ,I also had to accept that my dad would never recover.kei: Because Dio's immortal cells had become one with him.kei: This is all he does, all day long.kei: Every single day...kei: Day after day, for ten years,kei: he uselessly scratches around that box of junk.kei: If I take the box away from him, he just cries for days.kei: It pisses me off.main: ,Watching him just makes me hate the idea of living.kei: How many times have I told you not to make a mess?kei: He can be obedient if I discipline him,kei: but he never stops digging around in that box!main: ,Bleh...josu: Hey! You're the one who needs to stop!josu: He's your dad!kei: Yeah, that's right.kei: He's my father by blood.kei: But right now, he's as much my father as he's not.kei: He's a man who sold his soul to Dio,and got what he deserved.kei: Yet, on the other hand,main: ,do you know how it feels, not being able to finish him off because he's your dad?kei: That's exactly why I want him to die normally.kei: Once he's finally dead,my life can actually begin!kei: ! I told you to stop that!main: ,It pisses me off!josu: Hey!josu: That's enough!kei: I can't let you have this bow and arrow.kei: No matter what!josu: Don't get the wrong idea!main: ,I'll worry about the bow and arrow later.josu: Right now, that box has my attention!Gion,sfx: DogyaaGion,sfx: Dokoi: Th-The box?Gion - Copy,sfx: gyaajosu: I saw him grabbing at some paper scraps,main: ,so I was curious about what it was.josu: I see now.koi: A family photo...koi: S-So there was a reason.main: ,There was a reason for thebehavior he repeated for ten years.koi: He was looking for the photo of his sons at the time.koi: He might not understand what's going on right now,koi: but deep down inside,he still has his memories!koi: Memories of the past!signtop: Thesigntop: The Hasigntop: The Hansigntop: The Handsignbot: Okusignbot: Okuyasusignbot: Okuyasu Nijisignbot: Okuyasu Nijimurajosu: Instead of looking for a Stand to k*ll him,josu: if you'll try to find one that can cure him,josu: I don't mind helping you out.josu: But hand over that bow and arrow.main: ,I'm gonna snap them in half.josu: You planning to run?oku: Big Bro, let's stop this.kei: Okuyasu!oku: Come on, let's stop all of this, okay?josu: You were still here?oku: Dad might get cured, right?oku: Even if his body doesn't go back to normal,oku: maybe his mind and his memories will go back to how he used to be.main: ,Right?kei: Okuyasu!
