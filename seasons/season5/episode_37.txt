Get behind the wall!Trish: You're right out in the open!Trish: If you're hurt, you need to tend to your wounds!Gio: I-Is Giorno hurt? I can't seem to see him anywhere.Gio: Hurry up and hide, Giorno!Gio: Wh-Where the heck is he anyway?Gio: I can't see him at all from where I am.Gio: Could you tell me where he is, Trish?Gio: If he's hurt, we need to go save him!Trish: What the hell are you talking about?Gio: Huh?Trish: Nothing you're saying makes any sense.Trish: Wha—Trish: What the hell is this?!Trish: H-Hey, what the hell is going on?!JoJo-main: ,Why do I have these things?!Trish: N-No, wait! I'm missing something!Trish: It's totally gone!Trish: What I'm missing is way more important!Trish: Hey, Giorno! What's up with the blood on your hands?!Trish: Where the hell are you looking?! You! I'm talking to you!Gio: Y-You're talking to me?Gio: I mean, I was surprised earlier, but whatever this blood is, I don't feel any pain.Gio: It must be from when the mold att*cked.Gio: I had Giorno fix it for me, but the wound hasn't completely closed,Gio: so I think the blood is from my shoulder.Trish: The mold's att*ck?JoJo-main: ,But you...Mista: What... in the world...JoJo-main: ,happened?Mista: Did I fall asleep?Mista: I feel strange.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&H&\c&HFCC&}RumbleBoth: Wh-What the...Gio: Th-This face...Gio: G-Giorno's body and my body...Gio: No, wait. It's our souls, our minds.Gio: Could it be that while we were sleeping, Giorno and I, and Mista and Trish...Gio: Each pair's minds have been swapped?!Mista: Oh, no... I... I...Mista: What's with this face?!Mista: This body!Mista: I stink!Mista: My armpits...Mista: smell so bad!Trish: H-Hey, come on, Trish!Trish: That's not the problem right now!Trish: We were att*cked by a Stand.Trish: It's definitely not the boss's Emperor Crimson,Mista: Why me? No!Trish: but our minds have been swapped for some reason!Gio: Damn it! Could it be another one of the boss's elite guard?Nara: No, Narancia.JoJo-main: ,The boss is already somewhere near the Colosseum,JoJo-main: ,so I don't think he'd rely on one of his subordinates.Gio: Plus, Mista and Narancia mentioned an att*ck, but is that really what this is?Gio: Our minds have been swapped, but we're not hurt.Gio: What could have...Gio: H-Hey, Giorno.Gio: No matter what happens, I-I'm still older than you. Got it?Mista: Oh, my gosh! I have hair growing on my fingers!Mista: And my nails are so gross and malformed!JoJo-main: ,And they have so much dirt under them!Mista: I can't deal with this!Mista: I knew it! That stinks, too!JoJo-main: ,Why? Why did I have to be Mista?!Trish: H-How am I supposed to know?!Trish: Probably because we fell asleep near each other.Trish: And is that really what you think about me?JoJo-main: ,Do I smell that bad?Mista: Hey!Mista: What the hell are you touching there?!Trish: H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea!JoJo-main: ,I wasn't trying to touch it! It's just itchy around the elastic...Mista: Don't stick your fingers in my panties!Trish: Okay, I got it...Mista: If you spread your legs any further, I'll k*ll you.Trish: Okay, I get it! But you're wearing panties to make your butt look firmer,JoJo-main: ,so everything's so tight and itchy!Trish: You're even wearing a push-up bra.Mista: Just so we're clear!JoJo-main: ,The next time you stick your hand into my skirt, I'll k*ll you!Mista: I'm going toMista: curse you to death!JoJo-main: ,Narancia!Trish: Tch. Don't you get it? That's Giorno.JoJo-main: ,And so what, you're going to k*ll yourself?Mista: Stop that!Gio: Hey, guys...JoJo-main: ,I, um, have a question.Gio: So, Bucciarati...Gio: Um, so it's me and Giorno, and Mista and Trish.Gio: If we swapped minds with whoever was closest to us,Gio: then who did Bucciarati...Gio: I've been watching him, but he's not moving at all.Gio: Is he okay?Nara: Stay away from him, Narancia!Gio: Huh?Trish: There should be someone else inside Bucciarati, too.Trish: And we don't know who that is.JoJo-main: ,Is that what you're saying, Giorno?Nara: It all comes down to what went down at this Colosseum before we got here.Nara: Who was near Bucciarati?Nara: And what happened to the boss and the man waiting for us at the Colosseum?Trish: Narancia, scout the area with Li'l Bomber!Gio: I've been trying... but...Gio: Something's wrong. Li'l Bomber isn't...Gio: M-My Stand ability...Gio: Appear! Li'l Bomber!Gio: It's no use! Li'l Bomber won't come out!Gio: D-Don't tell me our Stands—Nara: No, Narancia. That's not it.Nara: Take a closer look.Gio: Li'l Bomber!Gio: I-It's so fast! It's so fast, I couldn't even see it!Gio: But what the hell?!JoJo-main: ,I don't know what's going on, but I feel so refreshed!b*ll*ts: I don't know what's going on, but...b*ll*ts: ...we're so full of energy!Trish: My Stand is still with me, but it seems to have powered up!Trish: I destroyed six iron railings in a single sh*t!Trish: My mind is on point!Nara: What in the world is this Stand ability that can swap people's minds?Nara: What's the purpose of this?Gio: This Stand user...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,As much as I don't want to believe it, are they our enemy?Gio: There's no one else nearby.Gio: I can't tell if any of them are the boss.Gio: Everyone around the Colosseum...Gio: is fast asleep.Gio: Even with my radar, I can't really tell how far it reaches.JoJo-main: ,No, wait...Gio: Some of them are moving just a little bit.JoJo-main: ,Some are even waking up!Cop: Man, that was a great dream.Guy: Wh-What the hell is this?!Cop: I assaulted some female cop and even handcuffed her.Cop: Tweet, tweety tweet.Guy: Arooo!Lady: Waaah! Waaah!Trish: So all the passersby got swapped, too?Gio: Yeah, it looks that way. There's confusion everywhere.Trish: What a weird ability...Trish: Hey, Giorno. What are you doing?Nara: I should be able to sense a soul's energy through the ground.Nara: But I can't... Who is it?Nara: Who did Bucciarati swap with?Mista: Narancia... I mean, Giorno.Mista: If you're thinking that the boss and Bucciarati got swapped,JoJo-main: ,there's one thing that's clear.Mista: That's not it. That's definitely not the boss's soul.Mista: If it were him, I would be able to sense him.Mista: But the strangest thing is that I'm certain the boss isn't nearby, either.Mista: The boss disappeared somewhere.Nara: Bucciarati...JoJo-main: ,You're saying we won't know about him until he wakes up?Nara: Until then, we can't take our eyes off of him.Turtle: It hurts...Turtle: Without question, the enemy is Diavolo.Turtle: Got it?!Turtle: I-It hurts...JoJo-main: ,But listen to me, Narancia... No...Turtle: Are you Giorno Giovanna?Nara: Golden Wind!Turtle: No... I'm not speaking from inside the turtle.Turtle: It's me. I'm the one speaking.Turtle: My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.Turtle: I was the one who arranged to meet you here at the Colosseum,Turtle: but Diavolo backed me into a corner,and I could no longer fulfill my promise.Who_swapped_with,Sign: Who swapped with whoMista___________,Sign: Mista                TrishMista___________,Sign: Giorno         NaranciaMista___________,Sign: BucciaratiMista___________,Sign: Turtle         PolnareffTrish: Who the hell is this guy? Who's "Polnareff"?Turtle: Let me just say this first...Turtle: I only did this because Diavolo left me with no other choice.Turtle: This strange phenomenon that's happening to all of you right now...Turtle: is a part of the arrow's power,the arrow I was supposed to give you.Turtle: I'm desperately hanging on to my soul... so I can tell you this.Nara: The arrow?JoJo-main: ,So you're saying this was caused by that arrow?Turtle: To be more precise, it's because my Stand, Silver Chariot, took hold of the arrow.Turtle: My body is already dead upstairs.Turtle: The reason I was able to swap souls with this turtle and survive isJoJo-main: ,because of that arrow.Gio: There's definitely someone in the hallway on the second floor.Gio: There's a dead guy who's been knocked out of his wheelchair!Turtle: It's only my body? Where's Diavolo?Trish: Hey! If everything you're saying is true,JoJo-main: ,your Chariot can return us to normal, too, right?Turtle: No... I currently don't have the power to control Chariot or make it disappear.Turtle: I don't even know where it is right now.Turtle: Chariot has basically gone berserk.Mista: Your own Stand went berserk?JoJo-main: ,How irresponsible can you—Nara: No. More importantly, what happened with the boss?Nara: What happened to him?Nara: Where is Diavolo right now?Turtle: I don't know.JoJo-main: ,Diavolo was right in front of me, but he disappeared.Turtle: All of you, listen very carefully.Turtle: The arrow is not your enemy, nor is it your friend!Turtle: What I'm about to explain to you is hope!Turtle: Such a trivial... trivial coincidence happened two years ago.Turtle: After I was incapacitated by Diavolo,JoJo-main: ,I somehow managed to survive and hid in a small farming village.Turtle: That's where the trivial thing occurred.Turtle: The arrow we had retrieved in Egypt fell between the wall and some furniture.Turtle: It's truly an insignificant thing.Turtle: Normally, one would just stick their arm back there and pick it up.Turtle: But for my body, it was an arduous task.Turtle: I thought about just leaving it there,Turtle: but I figured that Chariot could get it for me.Turtle: That's when it happened.Turtle: Chariot hurt its finger on the arrow.Turtle: It was mere coincidence.Turtle: The arrow draws out Stands from those who have potential.Turtle: But if it happens to pierce a Stand...Turtle: I don't know how old that arrow is,Turtle: but I'm starting to understand what the person who created it was thinking.Turtle: There's more to the power of a Stand!Turtle: Something that goes far deeper!Turtle: Suddenly, the birds in the sky fell,Turtle: bugs hid beneath leaves, and cattle laid on the ground.Turtle: And the farmers started sleeping in the streets.Turtle: I felt a slight change, but a much bigger change had taken over Chariot.Turtle: I had a bad feeling, so I immediately took the arrow away from it...Turtle: before it could go berserk.Turtle: Everything went back to normal, as if nothing had happened.Turtle: Then I realized that if someone who had enough power were to use this arrow,Turtle: they would have the power to control the minds of all living creatures!Turtle: But I currently don't have that kind of power.JoJo-main: ,And that's why I waited...Turtle: for someone like you who was searching for Diavolo's true identity.Turtle: Though, in the end, Diavolo was able to outdo me.Trish: So this controlling minds thing...JoJo-main: ,Do you mean the thing going on right now?Trish: It's just swapping souls?Turtle: No.Turtle: Remember when I said that this was just a part of its power?Turtle: I can't control it, so I wasn't able to see its potential beyond that.Turtle: But it definitely exists!Turtrle: Go retrieve the arrow!JoJo-main: ,Stop Chariot before the boss can, and reclaim the arrow!Turtle: The only way to defeat Emperor CrimsonTurtle: is for you to use the arrow to its full potential!Turtle: So in order to take back the arrow, you're telling us to k*ll Chariot.Turtle: Am I assuming too much?Turtle: That's fine.JoJo-main: ,Once you take the arrow, Chariot will be destroyed regardless.Turtle: Besides, I've already been finished off.Turtle: There's one other unbelievable and important thing that I need to tell you.Turtle: Are you the girl called Trish?Mista: Yes, though I currently have hairy knuckles.Turtle: I see...Turtle: The boss is a duo.Turtle: There was a kid who was somehow able to transform into you and trick Bucciarati.Turtle: Diavolo and this kid were like a well-coordinated team.Mista: What? B-But how?Nara: But that's impossible.JoJo-main: ,The boss trusts no one. That's how he kept his identity secret for so long.Turtle: I'm not sure what happened, either...JoJo-main: ,But there was definitely a mysterious kid.Turtle: If it wasn't for that kid, there's no way I'd have let Diavolo get that close to me.Nara: Two... So the boss is a duo?Nara: What's...Gio: Giorno! Something's moving!Gio: Nine o'clock. Uno signal.Gio: It's a person!JoJo-main: ,There's a person heading in from the gate on the right!Mista: H-He's...Mista: That face!Mista: The boss! No... Diavolo!Nara: Narancia...JoJo-main: ,Get Li'l Bomber behind him—Turtle: Giorno, wait!Turtle: The left! Look to the left, in the shadows!Turtle: So there it is!Turtle: That's my Stand, which the arrow evolved...Turtle: Chariot Requiem!Nara: He's—Nara: Th-This isn't good!Nara: Diavolo was looking for Chariot!Nara: He's trying to get the arrow!Turtle: Giorno, wait!Turtle: Don't att*ck just yet!Mista: That Stand!Nara: It's Zipper Man!Gio: Th-That's Bucciarati!Gio: It's Bucciarati's...JoJo-main: ,soul!
