It's been about four weekssince we began our journey.  If we don't hurry,we'll be in serious trouble.  Kakyoin...  Hey, Jotaro.  What do you think is upwith Kakyoin?  First he nearly kills usin his sleep on the plane, now this.   He even went after the baby.   Something's just not right.   If you ask me,he's at his wit's end.   Do you think he'll be ableto keep going from here?   For a second there,I thought he actually figured me out.   But now Kakyoin'shalf-doubting himself.   To top things off,we're in the middle of the desert.   All I have to do is waituntil they fall asleep.   If there's no one to wake them up...   Something smells good.What kind of food is that?   Baby food.   It's a concoction of milk,egg yolks, bananas,   and bread all stewed together.   So, you wanna taste?   Wow!   This is flat-out amazing!Give me more!   Easy now!There won't be any left for the baby!   Incompetent bastard!   How dare you eat my food?   I'm wasting away over here!   Hurry up and feed me, dammit!   A...   A scorpion!   Blast it!   That was a close one.   Crap baskets!   Kakyoin was watching.   He k*lled the scorpion.   That baby really is...   sh*t!   That's it!   Mister Joestar, Polnareff,did you see that?   -Huh?-That baby's not normal!   He just k*lled a scorpion!   He stabbed it!   The boy skewered itwith his own safety pin!   Kakyoin, hold on.   The hell are you talking about?   I'm saying that baby's not a baby!   He's not even a year old,yet he knew what a scorpion is.   And he k*lled itwith those tiny hands of his!   A scorpion?   Where is it?   It's in here!   There should bean impaled scorpion in here!   It's gone?   I swear it's true!He hid it somewhere!   Check his clothes!   We got it, Kakyoin!Knock it off! That's enough!   Mister Joestar!   Like I said,you're clearly exhausted.   Get some rest,and we'll talk about it in the morning.   Okay, open wide! It's delicious!   Uh oh?What's the matter?   You were hungry a minute ago.Did you lose that big appetite?   Say "ah."   Stop it!   I can't eat right now, you idiot!   Mister Joestar!I'm not imagining things!   I don't know wherehe hid the scorpion,   but I'm sure he's the Stand user!   And there's something I havethat will prove it to you!   Look at these cuts!Read what it says!   It's a warning!   It must've happened to mewhen I was sleeping!   Oh, my God!   Kakyoin, you didn't do thatto yourself, did you?   Eh?   Kakyoin, it's finally happened...   Oh, my God!   You colossal buffoon!   Didn't you realize if you showed themthe cuts on your arm,   they'd think you were crazy?   Did I just make things worse?   It looks likeI have no other choice!   It's time for a little force!   Hierophant Green!   It's no use.   The guy has completely lost his mind.   This can't be happening.I'm certain of what I saw, Jotaro...   His Stand was the one we foughtin our dreams, Polnareff.   We can't fall asleep, Mister Joestar.   Believe me.   Everyone...If we fall asleep, we'll be k*lled.   Please, you guys.You have to believe me.   Yes! My secret is still safe!   You guys lose!   Your petty mistrustjust cost you your lives!   Victory is mine, fools!   I can't believe it...    Does this mean Kakyoin can't fightor travel with us anymore?    We'll discuss it in the morning.    Time to sleep.    Polnareff, give me a handmoving Kakyoin.    Sure thing.    -Jotaro, you bring the sleeping bags.-Right.    You say something?    No. He's just really heavy.    -I'm gonna slice every one of you up...-I see.    ...and scatter your remainsall over the desert!    Why are we sitting aroundin the middle of an amusement park,    like a bunch of idiots?    That's right!    This is...    Jotaro! Mister Joestar!Be on your guard!    My memory's coming back.    We're in a dream world.    A horrible one.    We've entered a world of nightmares!    Oh, so it's just a dream.You had me worried there.    Don't make the same mistake I did!    Listen!Kakyoin was telling us the truth!    Baby. Stand.    We're in enemy territory.    I didn't believe it either,but that baby is a Stand user!    There's no one left to wake youfrom your slumber now.    Which means,they can't escape Death   !    I'll finally finish you all!    I knocked Kakyoin out!    He should already be here!    We've gotta find him!    Where are you, Kakyoin?    I've got to make this up to you!    Polnareff, good lord!What is going on with your hair?    Did you mess up brushing it?    Eh?    Polnareff!    -What?-My...    My prosthetic hand is...    Holy sh*t!    How are we supposed to fight him?    How?    Anything can happenin this world!    There are no rules.Nothing makes sense!    He has total controlover everything!    Wait.I remember there being one rule.    If he wants to slice us to pieces,    he'll have to use his Stand,    and nothing but his Stand!    Lali-ho!     DEATH   MANISHU BOOI    Lali-ho!    -Star...-Jotaro, it's no use!    It's impossible to bringour Stands into the dream world!    ...Platinum!    That's weird...His Stand manifested.    Lali-ho! I'm a fake!    The overwhelming power!The absolute terror!    It's so much fun!    A Stand is a manifestationof the mind.    And what are dreamsif not the mind laid bare?    My Death    has trapped youin your subconscious,    which is why you can'tsummon your Stands!    But...    had you summoned your Stands    before you fell asleep,    you could havebrought them with you,    like the clothes you're wearing,    sleeping bags,and your prosthetic hand.    Death    will never be forcedto face another Stand!    And only a Standcan defeat a Stand,    so I'll always come out on top!    Now...    How about you give me a scream?    One that capturesthe joy and elation    I'm about to feelat my easy victory!    Lali... ho?    Lali-ho!    Oh, it's just oneof the fakes I made.    What?    I don't understand!    This one doesn't seem to be a fake!     This is the real Hierophant!    It's normal!    Look, it's Kakyoin!    Kakyoin's right there!    Did you forget I'd summonedmy Hierophant    by the time I wasknocked unconscious?    I had it burrow undergroundto conceal itself.    Before I fell asleep, of course.    You can't do this!    Now, it's timefor your punishment, baby.    Damn that bastard!    Let go!    Give up, Death   !    I had Hierophant place himselfin your blind spot.    If you keep upthis futile struggling...    I don't care that you're a baby.I'll snap your neck!    Kakyoin!    Kakyoin.We owe you an enormous apology.    I thought you had lost your mind!    I couldn't take you at your word.    You were fightingthis battle alone.    And for that I'm sorry.    No, Polnareff.It couldn't have been helped.    I only realized how to bringa Stand into the dream    after you struck me with your fist.    So in a way,this is all thanks to you.    Really?    Now I feel conflictedabout the whole thing!    That's embarrassing...    He's going easy on mebecause I'm a baby.    Kakyoin, that compassion of yoursis a fatal flaw!    You're all still trappedin my nightmare world!    Uh oh, what's up with these clouds?    Those clouds...    They're changing shapeand closing in!    I'm warning you,don't try anything,    Death   !    Kakyoin!    You have to get Hierophantaway from his back!    How did?    I'll chop you in half!    Impossible!    How could he do that?    He chopped himself in half.    Kakyoin!    Lali-ho!    Haven't you figured it out?    Death   's body is hollow!    It has only a head,arms, and a scythe!    You gigantic ignoramuses!    Let's see.    Kakyoin's bodyshould also be split in two    inside the sleeping bag.    Nah, just kidding!    Kakyoin!    You sure you're all right?    Please take a closer look.    He wouldn't just clingto its back forever.    Surely you know my Hierophant'snot that careless.    He's not chopped in half!    He's turning into a string.    And he's slithering into my ear!    My arm is moving on its own.    He's invading my skull.    I told you before!    My Stand was in your blind spot,and your scythe couldn't cut him.    Now then, unless you'd liketo be destroyed from the inside out,    How about you healthe cuts on my arm?    Anything is possiblein a dream, right?    Healing a cut should be easy.    Right...    All right, everyone.Rise and shine!    Polnareff, up and at 'em!    There's a nice breakfast for you!    I feel like I had a terrible dream.    You and me both.    I'm drawing a blank,but I have the feeling it was terrifying.    Kakyoin!    -Are you okay?-I'm fine.    What?    You were acting likea deranged lunatic last night!    You even carved lettersinto your arm.    Huh?    The cuts are gone?    All right, I think I'll changethe baby's diaper now.    Huh?    It's morning, sleepy head.    He seems to be getting alongwith the baby.    Maybe I just dreamedthe whole thing...    Well then,did you have a good rest?    Oh, never mind!    Everyone's forgotten.    A Stand whose very existenceis completely forgotten...    What a strange creature.    But I haven't forgotten anything.    I suppose I am the only onewho brought his Stand into the dream.    Listen.Because you're just a baby,    I won't eliminate you.I won't even injure you.    We'll take you to a nearby town.    You need to be returnedto your mother.    But don't ever comeanywhere near us again.    If you do,you'll have to be punished.    In a manner such as this...    Is that my poop?    Oh, Kakyoin.    I see you've made somebaby food for the little lad!    Yes.    Good! I'm sure he must bestarving by now.    Hey... No, you wouldn't...    Eat up!These yum-yums are delicious!    Say ah!    Again? It's as if he doesn'tlike the stuff...    At this rate,I'll have to force-feed him.    Stop!    Hey, Mister Joestar.    If you force-feed him,he'll hate it even more.    In special cases like this...    Coochie-coochie-coo...    I told you it's delicious!    Ba-dum-tss.     HIEROPHANT GREENNORIAKI KAKYOIN    Joestar and the others have nowcrossed the Arabian Peninsula,    and are currently makingtheir way across    the Red Sea as they prepareto enter Egypt.    But!    Hey, old man. Something's off.    We're going the wrong direction.    I thought we were traveling west,straight to Egypt?    Looks like we're headingfor that island.    Yeah, you're right.    I've had my reasonsfor keeping this to myself,    but before we arrive in Egypt,we need to make a slight detour.    Someone is waitingfor us on the island.    He's someone importantto our journey.    "Someone important"?    I'm the one who let Avdol die.    There's no wayI can make up for that.    To thank you for freeing mefrom the lamp...    It's an actual treasure!    ...I'll grant you three wishes!    Can you bring someone back to life?
