There has to be something wrong!Black: You relit the lighter, didn't you?Giorno: No way! You bastard! What the hell are you doing?!Black: This soul...Black: did not belong to one who should be chosen.Giorno: One who should be chosen?Giorno: H-Hey, are you...Giorno: He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...Black: You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?Black: I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...Girono: So it indiscriminately att*cks anyone who happens to see the lighter relit.Giorno: Th-This is...Giorno: This bastard... He's dragging my soulGiorno: out of me through my shadow!Black: I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...Black: The first path is to become a chosen one.Giorno: It's no use... It's stronger than Golden Wind.Giorno: The old man d*ed after his soul was struck by that arrow.Giorno: So what's going to happen to meJoJo-internal/narrator: ,if my Stand is att*cked?Black: Your only other path is death.Giorno: Th-This arrow...Giorno: If I actually get stabbed by that arrow, I'm dead for sure!Giorno: I've got no choice!Giorno: Even if Polpo is one of the capos,Giorno: if he's going to stand in my wayJoJo-main: ,and even k*ll an innocent old man like he was a piece of trash...Giorno: I have to defeat him!Giorno: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Giorno: Golden Wind...JoJo-main: ,Only your senses will go berserk, and all movements will look slow.Giorno: It's gone! That's impossible!Giorno: It shouldn't be able to control its own movements right now.Giorno: Even if it were able to move, it should be extremely slow.Giorno: It shouldn't be able to disappear!Giorno: It has to be around here somewhere...JoJo-main: ,It has to be!Giorno: I have to find it before the slowed-time effect wears off,Giorno: or it'll att*ck me again.Giorno: What?!Giorno: F-From within the shadows?! Sh-sh*t!Giorno: Its movements are slower, but it's still just as powerful!Giorno: I can't move at all!Girono: The shadows! It's in the shadows!Giorno: It can only move within the shadows, but at amazing speed...Giorno: Looks like it can't follow me into the sunlight.Giorno: But the sun's going to set on the other side of the school soon.Giorno: Once that happens, I'll have nowhere to run.Giorno: What'll happen if I force it out into the sunlight?Giorno: It's definitely worth trying.Giorno: But how am I going to drag it out?Giorno: What should I do? It's waiting right there.Giorno: It's waiting there patientlyJoJo-main: ,for the sun to go down.Koichi: Hey!Koichi: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Giorno: Koichi!Koichi: Who's that guy collapsed at the bottom of the stairs?!Koichi: What did you do to him?!Giorno: Hey, don't get the wrong idea!Giorno: That wasn't me!Giorno: That Stand right there atta—Koichi: The wrong idea?Koichi: I saw you talking to that old man!Koichi: I was watching from the window!Giorno: You were... watching?Giorno: Then... did you see the lighter being relit, too?Koichi: Huh?Giorno: Don't step into the handrail's shadow, Koichi!Giorno: Get out of the shadows!Giorno: Sh-sh*t!Black: You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?Black: You have two possible paths.Koichi: Wh-What's going on?Black: The first path is to become a chosen one.Black: Your only other path is death.Koichi: This arrow is...Giorno: Golden Wind!Giorno: It hurts so much...JoJo-main: ,This hurts like hell, but now...Giorno: it looks like I was able to drag you out into the sunlight.Giorno: I turned part of the handrailJoJo-main: ,into morning glories and let them hang down.Giorno: Now you're out of the handrail's shadow!Giorno: So close!JoJo-main: ,There were more shadows nearby, so it managed to escape.Giorno: But it looks like if I can drag that thing completely out into the sunlight,JoJo-main: ,I might be able to win.Koichi: Wh-What was...Koichi: What was that Stand?!Giorno: As you saw, it's trying to att*ck us.Giorno: The old man who relit this lighter was k*lled.Giorno: Because we saw it being relit,Giorno: both you and I are now its targets.Koichi: That's not what I meant.Koichi: That arrow... It's from the Bow and Arrow!Koichi: I didn't know one was in Italy, too...Koichi: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Koichi: Is it because of you that another Stand with the arrow appeared?!Giorno: It'll take too long to explain everything...JoJo-main: ,But I don't know anything.Giorno: Do you know something about that Stand?Giorno: And about that arrow?Koichi: Why did you save me?Giorno: Telling me about that arrow is more important!Giorno: The sun's going to set!Koichi: Why did you save me?!Koichi: Don't you dare assume that I feel like I owe a thief like you anything!Giorno: The lighter being lit is because of something I did.Giorno: There was nothing I could've done for that old man.Giorno: I feel awful about it.Giorno: I believe what I did was right, but I feel dark and gross inside.Giorno: But despite that,JoJo-main: ,I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream that I believe to be right.Koichi: Two years ago, I was sh*t with a similar arrow and gained my Stand ability.Koichi: If the person sh*t with the arrow doesn't awaken to that ability, they will die.Giorno: Awaken to the ability?Giorno: That's it!Giorno: That's what it meant by the "chosen one"!Giorno: Someone whose Stand awakened!Giorno: And that must be the motive behind Polpo's test!Koichi: I don't know about the origin of the arrow,Koichi: but I've met a Stand very similar to this one before.Koichi: It's a long-distance remote-controlled Stand!Giorno: Long-distance and remote-controlled?Koichi: It can only carry out simple commands,JoJo-main: ,but it won't stop attacking until it's fulfilled its motive.Koichi: Our best option is to find the Stand user and take them down.Giorno: Sadly, that's not an option.Giorno: The user is in a jail cell. We can't get to him.Giorno: Anyway,JoJo-main: ,that thing won't be able to leave the school building's shadow,JoJo-main: ,so let's head into the sunlight while it's still available.Giorno: Then, before the sun goes down,JoJo-main: ,we'll lure it into the shadow of something that can move,Giorno: and then we'll get rid of that shadow.Giorno: That way, we can drag it into the sunlight.Koichi: Got it!Koichi: I-It's gone!Black: I've got you!Giorno: Wh-What?!Black: You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?Koichi: The crows!Koichi: It hid in the shadows of those crows and moved over there in them!Giorno: Th-This thing...Giorno: It's useless!Giorno: Sh-sh*t!Giorno: While in the shadows, its power and speed are much higher!Koichi: Act !  Freeze!Koichi: My Reverb Act 's ability is to make Stands or people heavier.Reverb: I've made its hands heavier,Reverb: so much that it won't be able to lift a finger from the ground.Koichi: It should let go.JoJo-main: ,I made the entirety of its hands heavier!Koichi: It shouldn't be able to bend its fingers anymore!Giorno: It's strong...JoJo-main: ,It's determined to not let go, no matter what.Black: You have two possible paths...Koichi: I-It's no use!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Any damage inflicted upon the Stand goes right back to the user!Koichi: At this rate, Giorno's legs are going to break!Koichi: Act ! Undo  Freeze...Giorno: No.Giorno: Don't do that, Koichi.Giorno: This ability that makes things heavier... Don't you dare undo it.Giorno: This is perfect.Giorno: This is exactly the ability that I was looking for!Koichi: But your leg's going to shatter!Koichi: Wh-What?Koichi: That tree...Giorno: Golden Wind is an ability that continuously gives life,Giorno: so that tree continued to grow, lived the extent of its life,JoJo-main: ,and is now starting to wither.Koichi: Ability?Koichi: But that tree's at least ten meters away...Koichi: So you got to the tree's roots by digging that hole!Bam,Sfx: BamKoichi: Y-You did it! The shadow's gone!Koichi: It's been dragged out into the daylight!Giorno: You told me there were two paths,Giorno: but sadly, you only have one.Giorno: Koichi, could you move to the right a little?Koichi: Huh? Like this?Giorno: Hmm...Giorno: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Giorno: Bask in the sunlight.Giorno: That's it.Giorno: That's your one possible path.Giorno: Still, I have to wonderJoJo-main: ,if I'm going to be able to join the g*ng now.Giorno: What to do...Sign: PolpoSign: Shadow SabbathKoichi: That arrow...Koichi: The fact that the Arrow is also in Italy meansKoichi: that there'll be even more victims!Koichi: I need to hurry up and tell Jotaro!Koichi: Wh-What are you doing?Giorno: Did you just say there'll be more?Giorno: We defeated Polpo's Stand,which had the arrow.JoJo-main: ,You saw it for yourself.Koichi: Defeated? You've got this all wrong!Koichi: I'll admit that we managed to escape its att*cks because of you,Koichi: but that Stand only stopped attacking because of the sunlight.Koichi: The user isn't hurt at all. They're perfectly fine!Giorno: So Polpo's alive?Koichi: Not only that, but long-distance remote-controlled StandsJoJo-main: ,basically don't affect their users at all.Koichi: He probably hasn't even realized there's been a battle here.Giorno: What?Giorno: So he has no idea at all?JoJo-main: ,He doesn't know I'm a Stand user, either?Koichi: Chill out, would you?Koichi: If he noticed anything, it was probably that his hand felt a bit heavier,Koichi: but he'd have no way of knowing that you and I are Stand users.Koichi: Hey, could you move your finger?Giorno: Sorry, but I still can't let you make your call.Giorno: I'm begging you...JoJo-main: ,This isn't just one enemy.They're an organization.Giorno: If you tell someone, the organization might find out.Koichi: Enemy?JoJo-main: ,Organization?Giorno: I'll tell you and only you, Koichi.The_Next_Day,Sign: The Next DayPolpo: Someone gifted me a special-order pizza.Polpo: Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's see, you were...Polpo: Giorno... Giorno, uh...Giorno: Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: Ah, yes. Sorry about that.Polpo: My head goes blank when I eat.Polpo: Perhaps it's because all my blood goes to my stomach.Polpo: This might sound sudden, but are you a religious person, Giorno?Giorno: I'm not sure... but I'm not very passionate about it.Polpo: What I'm about to say may contradict God's teachings,Polpo: but I'd like you to listen carefully.Polpo: If the most important thing in this world is trust,Polpo: the most despicable thing you can do is insult someone.Polpo: Listen well... To insult or betray someone's trustPolpo: not only hurts their reputation,Polpo: but puts them in a very sticky situation.Polpo: We will not fight others or risk our lives over money, power,Polpo: or having our seats taken at a theater or on the bus.JoJo-main: ,Fighting is truly foolish.Only idiots bother with it.Polpo: But...JoJo-main: ,I will risk my life over being insulted.Polpo: I believe that God forgives even m*rder.Polpo: Don't forget that.Polpo: Congratulations! I will allow you to enter the organization.Polpo: You did bring me the lighter still lit, as I trusted you would.Polpo: You pass.Polpo: That's our Passione organization's badge.Polpo: It proves that you passed.Polpo: You'll be working under Bucciarati for a while.Polpo: How about it? Why don't we celebrate your...Polpo: Did that brat actually protect the flame for  hours?Polpo: Or did he relight it and become a Stand user?Polpo: I couldn't care less about that.Polpo: Young, clueless guys like him are easy to use.Polpo: Either way, we can use him however we want.Polpo: Oh?JoJo-main: ,I could've sworn I closed that...Polpo: The blood does flow to my stomach after I've eaten...Jotaro: You met him again?Koichi: I'm sorry, Jotaro.Koichi: But I can't help thinkingKoichi: that he, Giorno Giovanna, isn't as dangerous as you think he might be.Jotaro: What makes you think that?Koichi: Well...Koichi: Well, I'll tell you that in person.Koichi: Is that all right?Jotaro: All right.Jotaro: If that's what you want to do, that's fine.Jotaro: I'll be waiting.Koichi: Thank you.Koichi: I'll talk to you later.Koichi: Jotaro, back then, I really did think...Koichi: Does this Giorno kid really admire that?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is he sane?Koichi: But I can feel it...Koichi: I can feel that he has a righteous heart.Koichi: I can tell...Koichi: Because I observed three members of the Joestar bloodline back in Morioh.Koichi: The three who exude righteousness from their hearts, as if it were their life energy.Koichi: I could see the same thing in his eyes.Koichi: Without a doubt, the blood that flows in his veins carries the will of the Joestars.Koichi: So I'm going to keep this to myself for a while, like he asked...Koichi: The golden dream that Giorno Giovanna possesses.Koichi: Well, then, maybe I'll go do some sightseeing.The_Next_Day,Sign: The Next DayBruno: Come with me, Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: What was that noise?Polpo: Well, whatever.Giorno: When someone insults you, even m*rder is forgivable?Giorno: I see. What you told me is very important.Giorno: You insulted that innocent old man's life.Giorno: So I changed one of your g*ns into a banana.Giorno: You should savor your last meal as best you can.Giorno: So... Where are we going?Bruno: I'll introduce you to my team.Bruno: They're all Stand users.
