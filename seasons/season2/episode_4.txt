You listen to me, and you listen well.Santana is responsible for creating the Stone Mask, which he uses to transform humans in order to absorb their potent vampiric powers.He is a thr*at to humanity! Santana must be k*lled! Be careful, Jojo! Think fast! I caught you off guard, you chatty chap.Top o' the mornin' to ya.Nice tae meit ye! Nice tae meit ye! SeÃ±or Santana, lets speak some Scottish! One and two and Nice tae meit ye! Once, four folks from the fires of Hell Shijima no soko kara mezameru sono hashiratachi toki wo koe awoke from their pillars after eons of eternal slumber.Shinku no chishio ga Their ambition for power assembled the blood of a few bombastic braves.tachiagaru yuuki wo hikiawaseru But one brave, whose fate was bound in his blood, Uketsugu ai wo sadame to yobu nara sh*t a sly smirk at his destined demise.hohoemu me de tsugi no te wo He would deceive the darkness and dodge the danger! Yami wo azamuite setsuna wo kawashite Yaiba surinuke yatsura no suki wo tsuke He would exploit the flaws of the foes he faced! And his memory would live on for all posterity! Tsuranuita omoi ga mirai wo hiraku He's like a bloody storm! Blazing bloody into a storm, Atsuku like a bloody storm ketsumyaku ni kizamareta innen ni but would he be free of the cursed fate of his family? Ukiagaru kienai hokori no kizuna Who can say, but the bonds of these braves nigirishimete will never be buried.Jojo VS.the Omnipotent Organism Episode Nice tae meit ye! Why are you trying to confuse him?! Are you trying to get yourself k*lled?! Honestly, who could really say that he's bad to the bone? I'm trying to get acquainted with him.I think that if you treated him nice from the start, he might've cooperated.Don't be so delusional! He m*rder*d all of my men! So what? You Limburger-smelling bastards deserved it! I would want you dead too, if you treated me like a guinea pig and sh*t at me! As for why I'm here, I came to bring Great-Uncle Speedwagon back to the Big Apple.I have no quarrel with SeÃ±or Santana here.So sing with me! Nice tae meit ye! Where are his manners? He just brushed me off without a single glance.I'm pretty perturbed now.Fine.I'll trip him up and make him kiss the floor in return! H-He walked through me leg?! A-And what was that feeling I just felt?! What is this "thing?" What purpose does this "thing" serve? New sentences! He's made many comprehendible sentences now, which means that he's already mastered the syntactic rules of Modern English! H-Hot damn! He's disassembling that machine g*n like a watchmaker to his watch! It requires hours of undeterred focus and attention to learn g*n disassembly, and yet H-He is demonstrating that he does possess the mental capacity to learn! Luminous Never, have I beheld such luminance Your people didn't take any lessons away from this experiment, but he took plenty from us all! Say SeÃ±or! If you can speak, then return my greetings! Anybody home? Jojo, stop that! Enough of your begging, you caveman of contempt! Holy mackerel! Ribcage Ripper! Also known as versatilis cavea thoracis! Any rib may be retracted to protrude externally outside the thoracic wall! Jojo! Scintillae? Only flint and tinder can create scintillae I could not devour this human and he was lofted away.Nor could I devour his leg, either.Never have I met so unusual a human.Is this human the only one with such talents, or are all the humans of this era the same as him? He is the only one with such talents.Jojo! He's in my head! Great-Uncle Get your stinking mitts outta my Great-Uncle! You are bad to the bone! I'm gonna bust your bad butt into a bust for The Met! Humans have evolved some, since I was last awake.Take a big bite outta my Ripple-sandwich! Th-The Ripple's making blood float off the floor?! It's not hurting him! My Ripple energy's being dispersed over his body and onto the floor, like rain running off a trench coat, causing the blood to float! His flesh works exactly like Straits's muffler because it acts like a lightning conductor! This human's energies are repelling my own M-My hand is whole! W-Well whaddya know? Curling my fist down to my wrist in a split kept my hand whole! But golly gee whiz, the Ripple's useless against him.What do I do now? You're wrong! It's not completely useless! The Ripple is acting as a barrier against him! It's preventing his body from devouring you whole! What good does that do him?! It's like eating Kugelfisch, ja? k*ll it first, and then remove all the parts with tetrodotoxin before eating! The Ripple is the tetrodotoxin to Santana, but he need only k*ll him first! What a pickle of a predicament this is! There has to be a way! At least a way outta here, so that we all survive! No, you Dummkopf!! Santana must not escape! He's a grave thr*at to all humanity! Shuddap! It was you and your Jerries who got us into this mess to begin with! And now, you expect me to save all of humanity because of your idiocy?! I'll bet I can channel the Ripple into you with this Kn*fe! His skin's like rubber, and it's stopping the Kn*fe from tearing though! But how will you manage to avoid me now?! I'll channel the Ripple straight into your sockets! This plan'll work like a charm! B-Bloody Hell! He rendered his whole head rubbery! Jump away while you still can, Jojo! Jojo! His diaphragm's been struck hard, so he'll be gasping for a while! So, the human's energies are born from his blood and breathing.However, he is a mere mortal when unconscious.Jojo! Use Ripple Respiration! Respire, goddammit! For the love of God, use Ripple Respiration! Jojo! Th-That's it! I'm gonna blow us all to kingdom come! May the Third Reich live for ein-TausendjÃ¤hr-! Stop that speech, Stroheim! Keep your pantyhose on! I was waiting for this from the get-go! If I couldn't get past his skin, then I'd get under his skin! I figured I could channel the Ripple from within him! Jojo! I was waiting for you to take the bait! Here comes the clincher! Be Rippled to shreds! I-I get it now! After seeing into his stomach, I understand how his spooky body absorbed everything he devoured! Every cell in his body secretes gastric acid for digestion, which breaks down anything his body devours! That explains why his body can devour others, and grow from absorbing those nutrients! I'm only whole because I channeled the Ripple into him before his cells began secretion! Still, your Ripple powers aren't developed enough! He survived the Ripple you channeled because it lacked potency! Trying to put yourself back together, eh? I saw how Straits did it during our duel, so I was waiting for you to do the same! Stroheim! Stay sharp, Stormtrooper! Can sunlight k*ll him?! I-It can, Herr Joestar! The murals in the ruins depicted the very effect of sunlight! Sunlight can k*ll Santana! That is why he created the Stone Mask, to withstand sunlight! Why are you showing him the way out, Herr Joestar?! We can't let him escape from here! I'm gonna let the sunlight finish the job I started! Joseph's gasping for air! He's fought well without discipline, but without Ripple Respiration training, he can't store Ripple energy for prolonged fights! This is as far as you will go, you contemptible caveman! Jojo! Respire, goddammit! I'd love to, but keeping this k*ller- diller from k*lling me is exhausting! Why did you have to be such a pisser?! Now, I'm gonna drag your arse up these stairs, and personally watch you burn to death! What the-?! I feel heavy M-My body's being weighed down! Wh-What in the bloody Hell's going on?! Brawn Bloodsuckers! Also known as sarcosanguisuga! Santana's flesh is stuck to him! Th-They're sucking my blood! Y-You trifling twit! Sunlight! You are the first human I have met with such mettle since my awakening.SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Stroheim shall unleash the sunlight! All that remains is opening this door.It's the least I can do.S-Stroheim You insolent idiots I was only centimeters away, too! Cease your struggle.Good grief! Herr Joestar! Do me a favor! What ever could it be, goddammit?! I'm trying to figure out a way outta this pickle, so shut your trap! Listen to me! Do you see those axes on that wall? Grab one, and use it to sever my leg! C-Come again?! Cut my leg off, Dummkopf! Once you do, I can reach the doorknob! W-Why the Hell would you even ask me to cr*pple you?! Be quick about it! His body will begin accumulating soon! Shuddap! I'm not a g*dd*mn surgeon, so don't even ask me again! I am an honorary SS-SturmbannfÃ¼hrer of the Third Reich! I was disposed to death the moment I accepted this assignment! I would willingly give both my legs and arms for the sake of das Vaterland! He's almost whole, Herr Joestar! I told you to shuddap! Keep nagging me, and I really will cut your g*dd*mn leg off! CUT MY LEG OFF! Blimey! I thought he was all title and no talent, but he's really willing to go all the way! My hat's off to you for your dedication to your duty, Stroheim! Timber! And now, I'm gonna enjoy watching you burn to death! Is he dead? Wh-What's he doing?! He's going up through the wound in my leg! No you don't! I-I don't believe it! He burrowed himself inside Stroheim's body, instead of mine! Santana's inside my body! Th-This monster just won't take a hint! His tenacity towards life is extraordinary! So long as he stays inside Stroheim, he'll remain immune to sunlight! W-Wunderbar Terrifically wunderbar! Would you like to know what's so wunderbar? I can't feel the crippling pain in my leg any longer! In fact, it feels absolutely euphoric! Stroheim! A-A grenade?! Y-You wouldn't! Herr Joestar! Today, you have witnessed the feats of Santana, the Omnipotent Organism! Now that he's within me, I'm as good as dead.At the very least, I know I'll be taking him with me.But before I'm blown, I need to divulge to you our intelligence.My only regret is that I'll be informing an enemy of the Third Reich! We didn't awaken Santana in the middle of a Mexican desert without good reason! Whaddya mean?! Why're you telling me now?! Listen! You have an obligation to hear what I have to say! Our researchers in the Third Reich located others like Santana in the catacombs of a certain city in Europe! I-It can't be! Speak sense and say it ain't so, Stroheim! Santana wasn't the only Man in the Pillar we found The Third Reich has sought to uncover the mysteries of an ancient species of h*m* which existed nearly 2,000 years ago, known as "Pillar Men." They will be awakened soon, and if we cannot discover any other susceptibilities aside from sunlight, humanity as we know it will be doomed! For this reason, we awakened Santana in order to collect data on his abilities and vulnerabilities! In 1888, your grandfather started the w*r against the Stone Mask, but now, it is your obligation, your fate, to end that w*r! Herr Joestar! Your Ripple powers are far too flaccid to be effective against them! Head for Rome! There is a Ripple Master in Rome! Herr Speedwagon is well-acquainted with this master! S-Santana's using my body to try and escape into that well! But the moment I explode, Santana will be exposed to sunlight! Stroheim Why?! "The might of mankind is made ever evident, as it stands stalwart in the face of fear." These were the words of the great Greek bibliographer, Plutarchus.Auf Wiedersehen.I bid you farewell, you accursed island ape! Don't do it! I still have more to ask! Goddammit, you stupid stormtrooper! Why'd you have to be so selfless?! Santana!!! Step aside! Failure to obey shall result in death, Jojo! I need to store Ripple energy through Ripple Respiration! Fly aside! I felt naught but an apathetic intent to k*ll from that clash! A-And now you'll say, "you cannot defeat me, you contemptuous caveman!" You cannot defeat me, you contemptuous caveman! It's about midday now, meaning that the sunlight from above will begin refracting off the water below! You're like an overcooked full breakfast now! The thought of a sundial should've crossed your mind before you leapt into a trap, caveman! I won't let you hit the water until you're dead! Th-The sunny-sun saved my buns and the sunlight's completely turned him into stone! I'll be the round about The words will make you out 'n' out I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley The muses dance and sing They make the children really ring I'll spend the day your way Call it morning driving through the sound and In and out the valley..In and around the lake Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you Ten true summers we'll be there and Laughing too Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be There with you Next Time Your grandfather caused mine to die! At least I can attract these pigeons! We're in control so long as these UV rays still shine! Awaken, my masters! Episode The Onmipotent Organisms of Yore
