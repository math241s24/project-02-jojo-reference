It's a helicopter!  No need to tell us.  They're here fromthe Speedwagon Foundation.  They're looking forsomewhere to land.  Speedwagon Foundation?   The group looking after Momback in Japan?   Your old friends?   You got it.   Don't tell mewe're taking a copter now.   No. As much as I'd like to,they're not Stand users.   We can't put them in harm's way.   So why are they here?   They've brought us an ally.   What? An ally?   He's a bit of a handful;   that's why it tookso long to fetch him.   Mr. Joestar!   You aren't seriously consideringtaking him with us!   He'd only hold us back.   So you know him, Avdol?   Yes, all too well.   Hold on.You mean he's a Stand user?   That's right.And his card is the Fool.   The Fool?   The Fool?   Sounds like a dumb card to me.   Just be glad he's not your enemy.   You can't b*at him.   What'd you say, you assh*le?   You'd better watch your mouth.   It's the truth.   Now move your hand.You're hurting me.   -Who made you boss...-Enough!   The helicopter's here.   Good to see you, Mr. Joestar!   Thanks for bringing himall the way here.   So...   Which one of you is it?Who's the Stand user?   I said, which one of youis the Stand user?   You?   It's not us.   He's in the back.   The back ...   I don't see him.   No, he's there.   Hey, hey, hey!   Come on! Quit joking around.   Is he really short or something?   Come out, come outwherever you are!   Watch out!   Huh?   What's this sticky stuff?   Please, be careful, sir!   The helicopter ride was rough,so he's in a really foul mood.   Get away from him!   I told you he's trouble!   Polnareff, remember,you can't b*at him.   I'm just asking where he is...   Huh?   He's...   ...a dog!   Don't tell me this dog is....   Yes, this dog possessesthe Stand of the Fool.   His name is Iggy.   He's crazy about ripping chunksof hair out of people's heads.   I don't know where he's from.   But Avdol found him in New York.   None of the dog catcherscould catch him.   Avdol was the only one who could.   Oh, I should mention.   When he rips people's hair out,he sorta likes to...   ...pass wind in their faces.He's kinda dirty.   You little mutt!You're gonna pay for that!   Damn you...   Chariot!   That's...   So that's The Fool.   We fought an orangutan Stand userback in Singapore, but...   Who does this stupid muttthink he is?   Don't make me turn youinto dog meat!   What the--It turned into sand!   I can't cut him!   And now he's solidifiedand caught my rapier!   That's...   It's a Stand made of sand.   I see... So the simpler their makeup,the stronger they become.   I'm not sure I could land a punch.   Hey! Help! Get this dog off me!   Sorry, Polnareff,   but I thinkI'll hold on to my hair.   You monster!   Did you bring his favorite snack?   Of course. He wouldn't havecome with us otherwise.   Stop! Help me!   He has a keen sense of smell.    What is that?    Iggy loves coffee-flavored gum.    He'll do just aboutanything for it.    Mr. Avdol,hide the packet before you--    Blast it!He grabbed the whole thing!    He loves his coffee-flavored gum.    People on the other hand...    At least take the wrapping off.    Now how is he going to help us?    -Good grief.-Damn it...    He's ruined my beautiful hair...    This bastard!    He's distracted, as long ashe's chewing his gum.    Let's get the supplies out now.    Here's water and food for the trip.    Oh, thank you.    There are medical suppliesand a change of clothes, too.    Also, a new camera to usewith your Stand.    A lot easier thanusing a TV, right?    Oh, I know.    Hey, men!    Ah, the perfect memento.    Avdol! Hurry up with the gum!    But you're already such good friends,Polnareff!    All right, Mr. Joestar,we're heading back.    Before you leave,I have something to ask you.    It's about my daughter...    How is Holly holding up?    And don't hold back.    Yes, sir...    Well, I'm afraidshe's not doing well.    She's losing strength rapidly.Nothing they do seems to help.    Our doctors atthe Speedwagon Foundation    say she has two weeks.    There's no time.    Damn it...    I have some other informationas well.    Our investigators say that,two days ago...    nine unidentifiedmen and women gathered    in a building believedto be Dio's hideout.    Apparently they leftand disappeared.    Dio and nine others?    We have no informationon their identities.    The spy who reported thiswas then promptly k*lled,    and the mansion had alreadybeen vacated.    We were unable to locatethe nine men and women.    Our spies aren't Stand users,so we couldn't tail them.    What, they're Stand users?    Hold on.    They can't be.Except for the Emperor,    the only tarot cardthat remains is The World.    I suspect that is Dio's card, but...    Avdol?    I don't know.    I'm astounded.Nine more Stand users?    It seems, Dio's head has yet to adjustto his new body.    He would never run from us.He's far too conceited.    He's going to do everythinghe can to keep us out of Cairo.    Good grief. Nine Stand usersin two weeks, eh?    That's one hell of a whirlwind tour.    We'll be off, then.    Godspeed, sir.    Thank you. Look after my Holly.    That mutt...    So it sniffed outthe Great N'doul, eh?    So close.    I almost caught it this time.    Just a bit more practice and...    The Tsetse Fly...    It's because of these fliesthat Joestar and his friends    uncovered Master Dio's locationin Egypt...    THE FOOLIGGY    Mr. Joestar,do something about him!    Why does this piece of sh*tget to sit in the seat    while we're stuck in the trunk?    It's so cramped, my back hurts.    You'll just have to wait untilthat coffee flavor runs out.    When it has,    throw some more gum into the trunkto lure him back there    and switch seats.    All right, all right.Calm down! Damn it...    What the hell?    Look! Over there!    That's...    The helicopter!    The Speedwagon Foundationhelicopter went down!    I see no sign of expl*si*nor g*nf*re.    It looks like it justfell out of the sky.    Could it be?    Be careful!    You can bet it was att*ckedby an enemy Stand!    Look! It's the pilot!    He's dead...    And whatever happened to him,it wasn't pretty...    The poor fellow.    Approach carefully.    Something could be hiding there.    It's water.    All this water...and from one person's mouth...    No, the water must befrom his lungs.    Where'd the fish come from?    He drowned inthe middle of the desert!    What on earth?    Hey...    The other guy's over here.    He's alive!    Talk to us! Hang on!    Tell us what happened!    Wa...    Water...    What? You want water?    Polnareff, hand me that canteen.    Huh? Right.    Here, just hang in there.Here's some water.    Drink it slowly.    No! The water att*cked us!    What?    It's a Stand!    The enemy Standis inside the canteen!    Damn it!    They were just innocent bystanders.    Why did it k*ll them!    Avdol, did you seewhat kind of Stand it was?    All I saw was a hand.    But I think it's stillinside the canteen!    I haven't seen it leave.    Who could it be?    So Dio met withnine men and women...    Could one of them be the assassin?    Jotaro, find the Stand user.    I'm already on it.    But...    I don't seethe Stand user anywhere.    When we battledthat idiotic Sun stand,    he was hiding behinda mirror, but...    it seems this timethe enemy's far away.    Polnareff, slice up the canteen.    Huh? Me?    The pilot's head was suckedinto that tiny little container.    If I poke a hole in that thing...    No way!    Kakyoin! You're closer!    Just use your Emerald Splash!    I don't want to.    Don't make me do somethingjust because you don't want to do it!    What's going on with you?    No means no.    Well, I already told you,I'm not gonna do it, either!    That's the...    Kakyoin!    It's the water!    It had already left the canteen.It hid itself in the blood!    The Stand wasn'thiding in the water...    It is the water!    It got Kakyoin!    It got Kakyoin's eyes!    Polnareff! Don't panic!    Summon Chariotand protect yourself!    Crap.It's going to get Polnareff, too.    What's going on?It att*cked the pilot's corpse!    No, not the corpse. The watch.    It att*cked the watchbecause of the alarm.    Sound! It huntsits victims by sound!    Sound?    sh*t! Polnareff!    It's coming for you this time!    Get to the car!    It's so fast!    Hurry, Polnareff!    It got me!    Hermit Purple!    It disappeared into the ground...    It detects sound throughvibrations in the ground.    And it moves through the earthwhere we can't see it.    It can att*ck us from behind    or from below at any moment.    What's worse,the Stand user could be far away.    So they've sought refugeatop that car.    Seems they've realizedthat I, N'doul,    am hunting them with sound.    No matter.It's all futile anyway...    How's Kakyoin?    It's not good.    He may have been blinded.    Let's drive.    We have to get himto a doctor immediately.    But if we move, it'll att*ck.    We can't afford to be careless.    What?    Hm? That sound...    It's the dog.    It left the car before I att*cked.    It anticipated my Stand's att*ck.    Seems this dog is going to bequite the nuisance.    The tires are in the water! sh*t!    It's no use. It's pulling us in!    I can't hold on much longer!    Everyone, move to the back!    Hey, flea bag!    You're supposed to help us,damn it! Help, already! Hey!    That accursed dog...    It knows I'm four kilometersto the west of them.    Oh, what to do...    Perhaps I should do awaywith the dog first!    Go ahead, get comfortablewhile we fight for our lives!    You stupid dog!    No, forget the dog.    Joestar and the otherscan't control that mangy mongrel.    It's harmless.All it cares about is taking a nap.    Now, for the k*ll...    It's so sharp! That water justslashed our front tires!    Get back now!    So that's what it's trying to do...    sh*t! Everyone hang on!    I can hear it!    Don't make a sound.    He can smell where the enemy'sgoing to att*ck next.    The water started chasing Jotaro!    If we can just find their body,    there's a good chance we can defeatthat fearsome Stand!    It's Iggy.
