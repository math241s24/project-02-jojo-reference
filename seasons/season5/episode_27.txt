I should've left the ladybug alone.Trish: I should've just stayed out of this!Trish: S-Save me, Bucciarati!Trish: M-My boot just fell over next to my foot.Trish: It's like it went through my foot...Trish: Wait, what?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,What just happened?Spice: Now, pick up that brooch, Trish.Trish: Wh-Who's there?Trish: Is someone there?Spice: I've always been here,Spice: ever since you were little.JoJo-main: ,I've always been by your side.Spice: Trish, please pick up that brooch.Spice: That's the decision you've made.Spice: You've already made up your mind to protect Giorno's left hand.Spice: Hesitation leads to weakness.JoJo-main: ,And... please, give me orders.Trish: Wh-Who are you?Spice: I am you.Spice: I'm also the one who got the thing off of your boot just now.JoJo-main: ,I am your ability.Spice: Now, if you've made your decision, please pick it up.Spice: You and I are going to protectSpice: Giorno's left hand!Spice: Trish, if we're able to protect it,JoJo-main: ,we'll open up a new future for Giorno and everyone else.Spice: And your future, as well.Trish: What's going on?!Spice: Pick it up, Trish!Trish: I'm finished!Trish: How the heck am I supposed to protect this thing?!Spice: This is your ability.Spice: I made the seat softer.Trish: Wh-What just...Trish: Made it softer?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I literally slipped right through the seat.Trish: And it somehow damaged that thing.Trish: The fleshy part of that thing ripped.Trish: That thing managed to stop Mista's b*ll*ts and catch up to this plane.JoJo-main: ,It has the ability to destroy things that are fast.Trish: But if it hits things that aren't moving, it takes damage.Trish: Are you... me?JoJo-main: ,Was I the one who just did this?Trish: The thing with the boot, too. Was that—Spice: What's important right now, Trish,Spice: is that you picked up the brooch.JoJo-main: ,Your strong determination overpowered any hesitation.Spice: You are becoming stronger, both mentally and as a person.Spice: And you are able to make anything in this world softer, more elastic.Spice: Making things softer...Spice: means they become harder to break than diamonds!Trish: I-It's coming again!Spice: This time, stay still.Trish: I'm starting to understand that you're me, but I have to hide!Trish: Make the closet door soft!Trish: Please make it in time!Trish: Damn it! Stay the hell away until I close this door!Trish: I-It managed to find me on the other side of the door, even though I'm hiding!Trish: I-I'm done for!Trish: I'm starting to understand that I'm a Stand user and have Stand abilities...Trish: B-But...Trish: This thing's invincible!Trish: The user is already dead, too. No one can defeat this thing!Spice: Trish, I asked you not to move.Spice: We have to head to the cockpit, where Bucciarati is,JoJo-main: ,but we went in the opposite direction.Trish: What are you talking about?JoJo-main: ,Giorno's brooch is developing into his left hand and moving.Trish: I had to run away!Trish: But your ability...JoJo-main: ,All it does is make things softer!JoJo-main: ,It's taking all I have to evade these att*cks!Trish: I-It's going to get me!Trish: I-It att*cked the clock again?Trish: What?Spice: I made the clock more elastic.Spice: As long as you don't move faster than the second hand on that clock,Spice: it'll continue to respond to the second handJoJo-main: ,and give priority to attacking the clock over and over.Spice: When I said not to move, I just meant to move slowly.Spice: Move slowly.Spice: Slower than the second hand.Spice: At super slow speed...Spice: But with the strength of a vise.Spice: We're going to rip this thing apart...Spice: and k*ll it.Spice: You bastard! Just go to hell already!Spice: You piece of sh*t! Quit latching on to this world, damn it!Trish: It's falling apart into tiny pieces and disintegrating!Trish: This Stand that just kept pursuing its targets, like a vengeful spirit,Trish: is becoming so small and disappearing...Trish: Y-Your name...Trish: Do you have a name?Trish: What should I call you?Spice: Spicy Lady.Trish: I see...JoJo-main: ,That's a fitting name.Sign: Trish UnaSign: Spicy LadySpice: Now Mista and Narancia's wounds can be healed.Spice: But Giorno Giovanna... He is a strange person.Spice: Not only is he able to give things life,Spice: but his actions also helped you mature.Bruno: I'm going to go make sure the engines are okay.Trish: Bucciarati, I have some news to break to you...Trish: The problem has already been solved. Giorno has actually already...Bruno: Don't say another word!Bruno: I-I mean... Slowly...JoJo-main: ,Come here slowly, Trish.Abba: Our altitude is , meters!Abba: ,...JoJo-main: ,,!Abba: It's no use. It just keeps falling!Abba: And I don't know why!Bruno: I figured out why we're falling, Abbacchio.Bruno: But what are we supposed to do?Bruno: What are we supposed to do about this?Trish: Bucciarati, what are you—Bruno: I told you not to move!Trish: D-Don't tell me...Abba: Th-Th-That's... But that's impossible!Bruno: Giorno said that thing has the ability to catch upJoJo-main: ,to things that move and take them in.Bruno: The engines on this plane... Just now, that thing...Bruno: Trish, don't turn around.Bruno: Don't panic, no matter what.Bruno: Slowly walk this way.Trish: Th-That's...Trish: No! Th-That's impossible!Abba: It's no use! We just keep falling!Abba: At this rate, we're going to crash!Abba: Actually, the engines are likely to explode before that!Trish: Th-That thing should've been torn into pieces and disintegrated...Trish: W-Wait, the engines are right behind the closet.Trish: Oh, no...Trish: If even a tiny part of this thing melded into the wall of the closet...Trish: There's a possibility that it took in the engine's energy.Trish: And now...Bruno: We need to make an emergency landing, Abbacchio.Bruno: The Tyrrhenian Sea is in front of us.Bruno: We need to make an emergency landing on the water.JoJo-main: ,It's the only choice we have!Bruno: An emergency landing?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Even if we're able to land safely, what are we supposed to do after that?Bruno: This thing will still come after us!Bruno: It's invincible. It's too powerful.Bruno: It's an invincible ability!Bruno: Now, slowly, Trish...Bruno: Slowly, like a slug. Don't panic.Bruno: Don't run, whatever you do!Bruno: If you rush, it'll att*ck you!Bruno: Wh-What the?!JoJo-main: ,What are you doing?! It's going to catch up to you!Trish: Yes, it certainly will!Trish: If I do something as lame as moving slow, it's going to catch up to me anyway!Trish: Get in the cockpit, Bucciarati!Bruno: Have you lost your mind, Trish?!JoJo-main: ,It's going to destroy the door!Abba: Th-The door...Bruno: Th-This is...Abba: What the... Don't tell me you...Trish: An emergency landing?JoJo-main: ,Bucciarati, we need to do the opposite.Trish: If we all want to survive and get to Sardinia safely,Trish: we need to... destroy this plane!Spicy: Wannabe!Trish: Spicy Lady!Bruno: T-Trish... This is... When did you obtain Stand abilities?Abba: Th-The walls and glass are all soft like rubber.Trish: If that thing is going to prioritize speed in its att*cks,Trish: then crashing would be faster.Trish: A plane crashing is way fasterTrish: than this parachute!Trish: Yes! You stupid bastard!Abba: We took pretty severe damage,JoJo-main: ,but now that the plane has crashed into the waters near Sardinia,Abba: that means the boss's men can't confirm whether we're dead or alive.Abba: Right?Abba: The organization's lost track of us.Abba: That means we've got some time now.Abba: Time to track down the boss's true identity and find him!Bruno: No, Abbacchio.Bruno: It appears that our damage is going to grow just a bit... just a little bit more.Bruno: I'll get rid of that thing.JoJo-main: ,I have to use my zipper.Abba: Wh-What?!Abba: Don't tell me...Bruno: It's completely invincible.Bruno: There's no way to k*ll this thing.Bruno: We can only chase it out with speed, just like Giorno did.Abba: B-Bucciarati, you can't mean... D-Don't do it!Abba: You're going to wrap that thing onto your arm?!Abba: Don't! Are you going to take yourself out of this, too?!Trish: No, Abbacchio.JoJo-main: ,No one else is going to get hurt.Trish: Giorno's Golden Wind abilityTrish: is safe right here.Abba: Wh-When did you...Trish: Arrivederci.Sign: "Goodbye."Nar: Stand name: Notorious Chase.Nar: Complete annihilation: impossible.Nar: Forced to track the crashing waves of the sea forever.Nar: At times, it att*cks ships that happen to move faster than the waves and sinks them.Nar: Eventually, these waters would be known to local fishermen as the "Tyrrhenian Belly"Nar: and considered ominous.Trish: Now, let's lay low and find out who the boss really is.Trish: We're going to track down my father's past!Nar: The private jet h*jacked from the Marco Polo International AirportNar: crash-landed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, fifty kilometers northeast of Sardinia.Nar: This mystery has yet to be solved.Nar: No passengers were found on board.Diavolo: I thought I'd made it disappear,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,but one's past wraps itself around one's true peace, never letting go.Diavolo: Unbelievable. This is why blood relations are so troublesome.Diavolo: It wouldn't be concerning if it involved a stranger,Diavolo: but once blood relations are involved, things become tricky.Diavolo: But that's all it is.Diavolo: It's just a blood relation. If I can get rid of that,Diavolo: I'll be able to remain in the prime of my life.Diavolo: Several days ago, after Pericolo secured Trish,Diavolo: the traitors who were after her scoured this apartment that Trish and her mother lived in,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,but none of them noticed.Diavolo: Every morning of her life,Trish awoke in this house...Diavolo: And...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Every day, she looked at this picture that her mother had lovingly put up.Diavolo: But this date... There's no doubt about it.Diavolo: It's fifteen years ago.Diavolo: This portrait... Even I almost missed it.Diavolo: To think that such a thing existed...Diavolo: Their plane crashed... but they're alive.Diavolo: I can feel it...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,My daughter's Stand abilities have awakened.Diavolo: I can also tell that she's alive and heading to Sardinia.Diavolo: And if it was Abbacchio's Moody Jazz that was flying the plane,Diavolo: that means he's also alive, at the very least.Diavolo: I can't let Moody Jazz go to the spot in this picture.Diavolo: Trish might not realize it right now, but she'll surely rememberDiavolo: the existence of this picture.Diavolo: And if she goes to Sardinia, she'll figure outDiavolo: that the person who took this portrait of her mother when she was youngDiavolo: was me!Diavolo: I can't let Moody Jazz's ability replay that!Diavolo: I'll have to go there myself.Diavolo: I have to do it myself.Diavolo: I can't let any of my subordinates attempt to handle this.Lady: Oh, y-you were home.Lady: I knocked, but... I'm here to clean your room.Lady: P-Pardon me, I'll come back later...Lady: Huh?Lady: Huh?JoJo-main: ,Why was I here again?Lady: O-Oh, right! To clean! I'm supposed to clean!Lady: Now, time to get to work.
