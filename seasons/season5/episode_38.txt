My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HFC&\c&HBAD&}s*abTurtle: I was k*lled by Diavolo.Turtle: But I swapped souls with this turtle,Turtle: so I'm just barely clinging to this world, basically as a ghost.Turtle: And that is my Stand.Turtle: The arrow's power caused it to go berserk, and it is now Chariot Requiem.Turtle: That's the reason your souls have all been swapped.Dia: Wait. If our souls have been swapped,Dia: then the one in my body is—Trish: He hasn't woken up yet.Trish: He's still out cold.Dia: Are you... Mista?Trish: Yeah. Glad you're safe, Bucciarati.Trish: The boss, Diavolo, who swapped minds with you,Trish: is being watched by Number Seven of the b*ll*ts.Trish: He hasn't moved an inch. He's completely out.Nara: Bucciarati!JoJo-main: ,Requiem's getting up!Nara: We already know how to use the arrow.Nara: If we take control of that arrow,Nara: everything will be over!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HCF&\c&HED&}RumbleCrunch,Sfx: {\c&HCE&\c&HE&}GwooooarDia: Zipper Man...

There are b*ll*ts on the ground, but I don't remember hearing them fall!Dia: But that's impossible! I didn't see it at all!Dia: Not him bringing out Emperor Crimson or making it disappear, either!Dia: And why?Dia: He hasn't moved an inch from that spot!Trish: Trish, drop one more b*llet from my hand.Trish: Hurry it up!Trish: The number of b*ll*ts on the ground is four!Trish: I can't deal with the number four!JoJo-main: ,Four is the number I just can't have around me!Trish: If it fell when you handed them to me, then you have to drop another one!Nara: Is he actually Diavolo?Nara: Trish, when we woke up, you mentioned thatJoJo-main: ,you couldn't sense the boss's presence from that body at all, right?Nara: What about now?Nara: Do you sense the boss nearby?Turtle: But that's not possible!Turtle: You swapped with Narancia, and Mista swapped with Trish.Turtle: That means Bucciarati switched with Diavolo!Turtle: That's Requiem's ability, once it's gone berserk!Nara: I don't really get what's going on,Nara: but if time just skipped ahead,JoJo-main: ,then it's a fact that that body isn't the one controlling Emperor Crimson!Dia: Narancia, what's going on in the area?Dia: Is there anyone else trying to come near here?Dia: Narancia?Trish: Trish, please...Trish: You need to drop... drop one more b*llet from my hand... please...Mista: I don't know...Mista: I don't know why I can't sense the boss.Mista: I have no idea why!Narancia: Move. Move!Mista: I can't sense him anywhere...Nara: Let me through! Please!Narancia: Please! Move out of my way!Turtle: Impossible! There's no way this should've happened!Dia: Keep an eye on our surroundings, Mista!Dia: Watch our backs!Trish: Narancia!Trish: Cut the iron bars, Bucciarati!Trish: We need to hurry up and get Narancia down!Nara: Leave it to me, Mista! Leave this to me!Dia: You need to load your g*n, Mista!Dia: He'll do it again! His att*ck had already begun!Dia: Zipper Man!Trish: Now heal him!Trish: Hurry up and get the iron bars out of him!Trish: The civilians outside the Colosseum are starting to wake up.Trish: Where is he? I didn't sense any trace of the boss at all!Trish: I don't get why his presence seems to disappear and then reappear anymore...Dia: Emperor Crimson's range is two to three meters, at most.Dia: So then how did he... from over there?Trish: H-Hey! You did it!Trish: Narancia's awake now!Trish: Yes!Trish: Th-That was a close one...Gio: No... Mista.Gio: This is... an empty... shell.Gio: It's an empty shell.Gio: The wounds he received...JoJo-main: ,have already been healed by my Golden Wind.Gio: But... he's already gone.Gio: Narancia...JoJo-main: ,isn't...Gio: It's... completely empty.Gio: His soul...Gio: It's gone.Gio: He's gone now.Gio: There's nothing I can do...Gio: I didn't make it in time...Gio: It's so empty that I could slip right back in... I could coexist in both bodies...Gio: That's just how...Gio: empty this body is.Trish: Narancia!Gio: This is too sudden...Sign: {\shad\fad(,)}Jean Pierre PolnareffSign: {\shad\fad(,)}Silver ChariotTurtle: Where is he?Turtle: Where could he be?Turtle: This is inconceivable!Turtle: This can't be possible unless there are two Diavolos!Turtle: Two of them...JoJo-main: ,That kid and Diavolo...Turtle: Don't tell me there are actually two of them...Crunch,Trish: {\c&H&\c&HC&}RumbleTurtle: There's only one body, but two minds!Turtle: Bucciarati! I figured it out!Turtle: Diavolo has two personalities!Turtle: That's the only possible way!Turtle: The one in that body right now is the kid that I encountered.Turtle: The kid and Diavolo have the same body, but their minds are separate!Turtle: At times, people's mindsJoJo-main: ,can be scarred and split due to a traumatic experience during childhood.Turtle: As they grow older, that split can develop into a separate personality.Turtle: That split personality starts to appear much more distinctly as they reach adulthood,Turtle: and one personality will be dominant over the other.Turtle: That's the multiple personality disorder theory!Turtle: Listen carefully. What I just said isn't a hypothesis.Turtle: I've even heard of reports from Germany and EnglandJoJo-main: ,where the individual's physical features change depending on the personality.Turtle: Requiem's ability tore his soul away from his body.Turtle: One of them, the kid, ended up in Bucciarati's body,Turtle: but the other one...JoJo-main: ,And it could be coincidental, but they ended up in someone else's body.Turtle: That's who Diavolo is!Turtle: Emperor Crimson att*cked from their body!Trish: What are you talking about?Gio: Two personalities?Mista: That's who the boss really is?Turtle: Slowly but surely, people are waking up outside.Turtle: So I don't know where he's hiding.Turtle: But he will come again!Turtle: He'll att*ck again, and soon!Dia: That's possible...Dia: But he could've already left the area.Dia: Diavolo is also after the arrow.JoJo-main: ,That's why he att*cked Narancia first.Dia: He got rid of our radar first.Dia: So we wouldn't be able to tell that he was going after the arrow.Dia: That's why he took down Li'l Bomber.Turtle: This just means you'll have to obtain the arrow's power after all.Turtle: Either way, if you're going to destroy Emperor Crimson,Turtle: you need to find the arrow before he does, and get it away from Chariot somehow.Dia: Which way did Requiem go?Turtle: To the left.Turtle: It looks like people are starting to wake up in the direction he's headed.Mista: Find it? But your body is...Mista: What about your body, Bucciarati?Trish: I missed all his vital points.Trish: But he won't be able to stand up and move.Trish: I made sure of that.Gio: We're going to have to leave you behind here.Gio: So that no oneJoJo-main: ,can hurt you anymore...Gio: Ever again.Gio: But I promiseJoJo-main: ,that I will take you back home.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HDA&\c&H&}RumbleDia: Watch out for anyone coming near us!Dia: Let's go!Trish: Trish! What are you doing? Stay close!JoJo-main: ,R-Right.Guy: Hey, the woman running over there! You're under arrest!Guy: You're going to accompany me to the station!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HFBC&\c&HCFC&\fad(,)}KablamMista: I-Is something wrong, Mista?Trish: Nope! Everything's fine!Trish: They got close, so I thought it might've been the boss,Trish: but it was just some cop.Dia: It does indeed seem that RequiemJoJo-main: ,doesn't have a destination in mind, nor any emotions.Dia: It hasn't even looked at me or the direction its heading.Dia: It does look like a living creature,JoJo-main: ,but it also looks like something resembling black plastic.Dia: It hasn't even recognized me as an enemy.Dia: It seems to be slow and even weak.Dia: And it's a fully physically formed Stand.Dia: Civilians can see and touch it.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&H&\c&HF&}R{\c&HF&}i{\c&H&}pCrunch,Sfx: {\c&HB&\c&HABF&\pos(.,.)}Drag...Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HC&\c&HBDA&}DragGio: It's no use... It's not letting us get close.Gio: It's not just our Stands.JoJo-main: ,If we try to touch it with something, it'll come flying back at us.Gio: This arrow might truly be invincible.Gio: The more difficult this becomes, the more I'm convinced that it hasJoJo-main: ,some kind of isolation power that repels everyone.Dia: It's getting up again.Mista: How can we pick up the arrow?Mista: It's right in front of us!Turtle: Hey.Turtle: Requiem won't allow Stand users to pick up the arrow.Turtle: But what if someone who's not a Stand user tried to pick up the arrow?Turtle: Well, what do you think will happen?Trish: Why are you asking me that? How the hell would I—Crunch,Sfx: RumbleTrish: H-Hey, guys!Turtle: My soul is holding on for dear life within this turtle.Turtle: I'm no longer a Stand user...Turtle: so I was able to touch it!Turtle: Mista! Hurry up and pierce your Stand with this arrow!
