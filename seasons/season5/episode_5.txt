The problem is his successor.Girl: How do I look?Sign: Rome : a.m.Sale: I just heard that the capos are freaking out.Sale: Apparently, Polpo committed su1c1de.Mario: Huh?Sale: Hey, watch where you're going!Mario: I'm fine.Mario: su1c1de? That fatso?Sale: I told you to watch where you're going!Sale: So I dunno if Polpo was sad because he was in prison or if his obesity made him depressed,Sale: but he apparently wasn't very strong mentally.Sale: He put his own g*n in his mouth and blew his brains out.Mario: You sure it was su1c1de and not m*rder?Sale: It was su1c1de, for sure. From the... autopsy, they call it?Sale: Any expert can tell if it was a su1c1de or m*rder.Sale: Hey, there's a light up ahead.Sale: More importantly, have you heard the rumors about Polpo's fortune?Mario: Rumors?JoJo-main: ,I don't know where the end of the universe is, and I don't know jack about that, either.Sale: Before Polpo went to prison,JoJo-main: ,he converted some of his fortune into jewels and goldSale: and hid them somewhere.Sale: He has a hidden fortune.Sale: It's too much to even deposit in the bank, and he kept it secret from the organization.Sale: No one was stupid enough to look for it while Polpo was alive.Sale: But now that he's dead, that fortune doesn't belong to anyone.Sale: It's free money.Sale: It's said to be worth about five billion lire.Mario: Five billion?Mario: If I had that much money,JoJo-main: ,I'd be heading to Monaco or Japan with a girl on each arm.Sale: Nah, I'd rather work my way up.Sale: If I can climb up to capo with that money, I can taste honey that's even sweeter.Sale: But who knows where it's hidden...Mario: No one knows?Sale: Nah, and this is just what I'm thinking...Sale: But Polpo was such a fatty, he couldn't even go outside on his own.Sale: Do you think he could hide a fortune worth five billion on his own?Sale: He must've had someone do it for him.Sale: Someone who's good at keeping their mouth shut...Sale: Though I'm not sure anyone like that actually exists.Sale: But Polpo liked Bucciarati.Mario: Bucciarati? That's one of the thugs from Naples, right?Sale: Yeah. If anyone could've hidden it, it's him.Sale: And now that Polpo's dead, Bucciarati should be making his move...Sale: to get the five billion lire that's just been freed up.Sale: I'm sure that even Bucciarati wants money.Sale: Hey, Zucchero!Sale: That bastard Zucchero actually left!JoJo-main: ,Did he seriously believe that?Sale: If you're actually going to trail Bucciarati, I'd be careful.Sale: Apparently, he and his subordinates are Stand users.Rome___a_m_,Sign: Naples : a.m.Nara: Hey, Fugo.Nara: It's such a nice day outside.JoJo-main: ,It wouldn't hurt to skip out on studying for one day.Nara: I'm just not feeling it today.Waiter: Thank you for waiting.

Just tell me! Okay?Gio: Who knows?JoJo-main: ,You're all keeping your abilities secret, too, aren't you?Abba: So he's a Stand user?Gio: What I did with the liquid in the cup is...Gio: I used my ability to change one of my teeth into a jellyfish,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,which is  percent liquid, to suck it up.Fugo: Is it, like, some ability to move things?Mista: Open your mouth. There's no hole in there, is there?Nara: You actually drank it for real?Bruno: I'm not sure what it is,JoJo-main: ,Was that your favorite or something?Bruno: but there's something about Giorno Giovanna that makes him hard to dislike.Fugo: If you guys tell me about your powers, I might tell you mine.Giorno: You're cautious.

This took a sudden turn for the awesome.Nara: Where is it?Nara: Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?Bruno: I can't tell you that yet.Bruno: Rumors of his hidden fortune have made the rounds in the organization.Bruno: No one can find out before we secure the money.Nara: B-Bucciarati!Bruno: Hey!

If you're just fooling around and hiding... Hup!Mista: Hurry up and answer us!Bruno: Narancia, where are you?Giorno: Narancia! Answer us!Fugo: Mista?Fugo: What are you doing, Mista?Fugo: Mista?Fugo: Where did you go, Mista?Bruno: It can't be...Fugo: Come on, Mista!Fugo: Why are you messing around nowâBruno: Fugo?Bruno: Hey, Fugo!Abba: What?Giorno: What's going on?Bruno: Abbacchio, Giorno, stay close to each other!Bruno: We're being att*cked!Bruno: There's someone hiding somewhere on this boat!Bruno: This is a Stand att*ck!Abba: But why now?Bruno: The money.Bruno: Someone found out that I knew where the money was,Bruno: and they're trying to steal it.Bruno: Which means they're from the organization.Abba: Does that mean they've been quietly tracking us ever since we were on the shore?Bruno: Looks that way.Bruno: They probably grew impatient because I wouldn't just say where the money is.Bruno: They intend to get rid of everyone but me, then make me cough up the location.Bruno: And they can take their time, since we're on the ocean with nowhere to run.Abba: Are you saying Narancia and the others are dead?Bruno: I didn't say that.Bruno: But it's for ten billion.JoJo-main: ,They'd even k*ll someone from their own organization for that.Giorno: No, Narancia and the others are alive.Giorno: They're somewhere on this boat.Giorno: I don't know if this person is trying to use them as hostages,Giorno: but they're alive.Abba: Giorno Giovanna,Abba: how the hell can you be so sure about that?Giorno: I used my Stand to turn Narancia's shoe into a fly.Giorno: The fly is trying to return to its owner, Narancia.Giorno: If Narancia was truly dead, it wouldn't be flying around searching like that.Bruno: Can you locate him?Giorno: He's alive... He's alive, but...Giorno: It's not going down into the cabin or in the locker.Giorno: The fly's not trying to stop...Giorno: It keeps flying around that area looking for Narancia.Abba: What the hell is his ability?Bruno: Just shut up and listen.Giorno: Narancia is somewhere near the entrance to the cabin.Giorno: That's a fact.Giorno: But for some reason, the fly can't find him, so it's lost.Giorno: I think it's safe to assume that we'll find the enemy wherever Narancia is.Giorno: Which means the enemy isn't just randomly hiding behind something.Bruno: I see.JoJo-main: ,So if we don't figure out the mystery behind the enemy's ability,Bruno: getting too close without knowing could get us k*lled.Giorno: Correct.JoJo-main: ,But the fact that their ability requires them to att*ck while hidden is a shortcoming.Giorno: If we can figure out the mystery behind it, we'll be able to defeat them.Bruno: Abbacchio, your Stand...Bruno: might be perfect to defeat such an enemy.Giorno: Defeat?Giorno: Can you solve this mystery with your ability?Abba: Hard to say...Bruno: Damn it, Abbacchio!Bruno: You'd better not be hung up on stupid sh*t at a time like this!Abba: Stupid sh*t?JoJo-main: ,No.Abba: This has to do with my safety.Abba: I can't just carelessly reveal my Stand abilityAbba: in front of a stranger that I can't trust.Abba: Bucciarati,Abba: I don't know what made you trust this guy,Abba: but I don't consider him a part of the team.Bruno: If we don't figure out the enemy's location, we're going to be k*lled!Abba: And I'm saying that's just this untrustworthy brat's hypothesis.Abba: He just came up with it out of fear. He didn't see anything.Bruno: Abbacchio!Abba: The enemy is just hiding somewhere in the cabin.Abba: I'll find them and take care of them.Giorno: If we get close without figuring out the mystery, we're going to get kilâAbba: Shut your mouth!Abba: You stupid little brat...Giorno: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.Abba: What are you talking about?Giorno: You can solve the mystery, right?Giorno: I'm counting on you!Bruno: Giorno!Bruno: What the hell are you doing?!Crunch,Sfx: RoarBruno: G-Giorno!Bruno: There's an enemy over there!Bruno: sh*t!Bruno: Giorno's in trouble!Bruno: Abbacchio...Abba: Giorno Giovanna... You're one crazy bastard.Abba: All this to prove yourself...Abba: What the hell is wrong with you?
