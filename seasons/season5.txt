Haruno Shiobana!Jotaro: That was fast.Koichi: Where do I even begin?JoJo-main: ,I immediately ran into him at the airport...Koichi: And, yes, it's safe to say...Koichi: He's a Stand user!Koichi: He goes by the name Giorno Giovanna in Italy.Koichi: You mentioned before thatKoichi: Stand users are drawn to other Stand users, right?Koichi: We seriously met by coincidence!Koichi: He's a student, but he acts like a delinquent.JoJo-main: ,He stole my money and my luggage!Koichi: And it appears his Stand's ability isJoJo-internal/narrator: ,returning his opponent'sattack right back at them.Jotaro: Sorry about all this.JoJo-main: ,I'll get you a hotel and wire you some money.Koichi: Thank you.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Also, his hair was blond, unlike in the picture.Koichi: After asking some people who knew him about it,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,they said that he didn't dye it. It just suddenly turned that color.Koichi: Something about his dead father's genes.Koichi: Who's his father?Koichi: Are you and his father somehow related?jotaro: I'm the onejotaro: who k*lled his father.Jotaro: His name is DIO Brando.Koichi: DIO?Koichi: You mean the one involved with the bow and arrow?Glob: ,s*abJotaro: I found out this year that DIO may have had a child.Jotaro: That's why I wanted to find out for sureJotaro: if Giorno Giovanna was really DIO's child, and if he's somehow inherited his body.Koichi: But doesn't DIO's body belong to the Joestar bloodline?Jotaro: The fact that his hair turned blond may be a sign thatJotaro: the DIO blood in him, his Stand power, recently awakened.Jotaro: There might have been a trigger...JoJo-main: ,like a powerful Stand user being in that city.Koichi: A powerful Stand user?Jotaro: Don't go near him anymore.Jotaro: It's dangerous to take this further.Jotaro: Understand?Koichi: Just one last question...Koichi: Is he our enemy?Koichi: Or is he a friend?Jotaro: What do you think?Jotaro: You're the one who actually met him.Jotaro: What was your impression of him?Koichi: I'm not sure.Koichi: But, um...Koichi: He seemed like a very eloquent person.Bruno: Did you drop this?Giorno: No.Bruno: I see.Bruno: Guess it's mine now.Bruno: Let's say you found a bag with , lire inside.Bruno: would you take it to the authorities?Giorno: No way. I'd totally take it.Bruno: Well, aren't you honest?Bruno: But what if I was a plainclothes police officer and saw you take it?Giorno: I'd give you half and have you look the other way... probably.Bruno: Wow, that's great!Bruno: And I'm sure that's actually what you'd do.Bruno: You're not kidding or bluffing.Bruno: I can tell!

He won't be regaining consciousness.Bruno: I'm trying to find out who's responsible.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna, no one knows why Leaky Eye Luca was at the airport.Bruno: But the airport security guardsJoJo-main: ,let me know that you were at the airport.Bruno: That's why I figured I'd come see you and ask you some questions.Giorno: Are you actually a police officer?Bruno: Of course not.Bruno: Luca's no ordinary crook. He's a g*ng member.JoJo-main: ,There are plenty of reasons he might've been taken out.Bruno: He knew how to get people to hate him.Bruno: But that's not what his boss is thinking about.Bruno: The boss feels like his name wasJoJo-main: ,personally tarnished since one of his own was taken out.Bruno: That's why he told me to find out who took him out and settle the score.Bruno: I'm asking you...JoJo-main: ,Did you happen to run into Leaky Eye Luca at the airport?Giorno: No. I don't know who you're talking about.Bruno: You're not sweating.JoJo-main: ,All right, I'll believe you.Bruno: That does it for my questions.JoJo-main: ,Sorry to have bothered you, Giorno Giovanna.Giorno: What is that?JoJo-main: ,My hand was clenched the whole time.Bruno: That's Luca's right eye.Bruno: He's unconscious anyway, so I just brought it.Bruno: This taste... is the taste of someone who's lying, Giorno Giovanna!Bruno: Well, well, well, well...Bruno: I said I was done with my questions,Bruno: but the situation seems to have changed, Giorno Giovanna.Bruno: You told me a lie.JoJo-main: ,And now, I'm going to have to find out why you lied to me, aren't I?!Bruno: What are you looking at?JoJo-main: ,Are you jealous?JoJo-main: ,Did you want to hit him, too?Bruno: My name is Bruno Bucciarati.Bruno: Answer me.JoJo-main: ,Your questioning has already turned into t*rture.Bruno: Well? This is a pretty creepy ability, isn't it?Giorno: Th-That's...Bruno: Those are Luca's fingers.Bruno: To tell you the truth...JoJo-main: ,Leaky Eye Luca was disposed of by our boss.Bruno: He said that there's no point in him living anymore.Bruno: I took his fingers for torturing.Giorno: It's happening again! What the hell?Giorno: Is he also like that Japanese tourist?Bruno: Other than being able to tell if people are lying or not, I can also do this...Bruno: I can put whatever I want in your mouth.Bruno: For example...Bruno: I can even put that fire extinguisher in your mouth.Bruno: Though I'm afraid you'd die if I did that...Bruno: Talk!Bruno: You know who's responsible.Bruno: Were you told not to tell anyone?Bruno: Let's have you tell me who did Luca in.Giorno: There's no doubt about it... He has a similar ability!Bruno: If you don't hurry up and tell me, your t*rture is just going to get worse,Bruno: Giorno Giovanna!Giorno: This guy's bad news!Giorno: In that case...Giorno: I'll have to use Golden Wind and dodge his att*cks!

He's serious!Bruno: This brat is actually going to try to k*ll me!Bruno: He's intense enoughJoJo-internal/narrator: ,that he'd actually do what he says he's going to do!Kabaam,Sfx: KabaamBruno: Zipper Man!Giorno: So that's his Stand?Kabaam,Sfx: KashinkBruno: Now I know for sure that my Zipper Man is more powerful.Bruno: I wasn't told that I need to bring the suspect back alive.Bruno: I wouldn't mind taking care of you here.Bruno: But I've had my fill of dealing with your dangerous powers today,Bruno: so I'm leaving.Bruno: I'm going to keep my distance for now,Bruno: but I'll take care of you eventually.Giorno: He can even pass through a solid wall by putting a zipper on it?!Giorno: This isn't good!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Letting him out of the cable car is gonna be trouble!Giorno: If I lose him now, it won't matter that I have Golden Wind!Giorno: If he's going to come after me / with that ability,Giorno: there's absolutely no guarantee I'll survive!Giorno: I'm going to lose!Giorno: I can't let him get away!Giorno: If he tells his friends about me, this will end up out of my control!Giorno: I have to stop him right here, right now!Giorno: For the sake of my future!Guy: O-Ow!Guy C: Be more careful, damn it!Giorno: He disappeared!Giorno: Where could he have gone in that instant?Giorno: Don't tell me he can even enter people with his zipper!Guy: What are you going to do about this? I'm covered in garbage!Giorno: But that's the only thing I can think of!Giorno: That must be how he got that eyeball and those fingers inside me!Giorno: Bucciarati went into one of these guys to hide, like wearing a costume...Giorno: And that's how he's planning to head back into the city.Guy: Better get my broom...Giorno: They're all heading in different directions.Giorno: I don't see a zipper.Giorno: Which one is it?Giorno: Which one is he hiding in?Guy: What the hell's your problem, you stupid fly?!Jump,Sfx: JumpBruno: A tooth?Giorno: I gave life to the tooth that broke out of your mouthGiorno: and had it be reborn as a fly.Giorno: The fly would return to you so I could tell where you were...Giorno: But this isn't good.Giorno: I just got done saying we wouldn't involve any civilians...Giorno: But my bad. That was a lie.Giorno: Still, he ended up hitting himself with his own power,Giorno: so I hope you can just deal with it.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna, I can see your ability is not to be underestimated.Bruno: You leave me no choice.JoJo-main: ,This will be dangerous,Bruno: but it seems I'll have to take care of you right here, right now.Giorno: I can't let you escape.Giorno: I'm pretty determined about that.Bruno: Let me escape?JoJo-main: ,You don't have to worry about that.Bruno: The only thing you have to worry aboutBruno: is what you'll do once your body parts have been zipped apart all over the ground.Bruno: This battle will be decided by who hits the other first.Bruno: What's the matter?Bruno: Come at me, Giorno Giovanna.Gold: Useless!Thud,Sfx: ThudGiorno: Just your senses will go berserk.Bruno: "You hit me first, so how?"Bruno: I don't blame you for wondering that.Bruno: This isn't my arm.Bruno: My Zipper Man's ability allows two separate things to be connected with a zipper.Bruno: This is that kid's arm.Bruno: I switched it out with mine.Bruno: Because, of course, I'd rather avoid the danger of being hit with your ability.Bruno: That's why your Golden Wind didn't work.Bruno: What are you trying to do, Giorno Giovanna?!Bruno: I'm ending you right now!Bruno: Unbelievable... He ripped off his own armBruno: to extend his range a bit further and strike a moment faster...Giorno: Golden Wind!Bruno: I-It's happening again!JoJo-main: ,Just my senses have gone berserk!Bruno: H-He's going to get me!Bruno: The destructive power of Giorno Giovanna's Stand ability isn't too great...Bruno: But in this case, that actually makes things worse!Bruno: If I have to experience that slow pain not once, but multiple times...Bruno: I'll probably die from the shock of the pain!Bruno: Don't!Bruno: Stop!Bruno: He went out of range?Bruno: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Bruno: Why did you stop attacking me?Bruno: Why didn't you finish me off?!giorno: Because you're a good person.Giorno: You're in a g*ng, but you're a good person.giorno: You hesitated for a moment before attacking me,giorno: so I decided I wouldn't att*ck you, either.Giorno: When you saw the arm you took off of this kid,Giorno: you were shocked to see the state it was inGiorno: and stopped attacking for a moment.Giorno: You were shocked that he'd been sh**ting up dr*gs.Giorno: How old is he?Giorno: Thirteen.Giorno: If you were just some gangster who wouldn't have hesitated or been shocked,Giorno: I probably would've been rolling around on the ground in pieces.Giorno: But you seem different.JoJo-main: ,That's why I stopped.Giorno: There are people in this city who would sell dr*gs to kids.Giorno: They're unforgivable.Giorno: That's what you believe.Giorno: But the one selling those dr*gs is your boss.Giorno: You can't help but feel conflicted about that.Giorno: That's why your heart ached when you saw his arm.Bruno: So what? That's got nothing to do with me eliminating you.Bruno: I've been ordered to find the one who att*cked Luca and eliminate them!Bruno: Just because you stopped attacking me doesn't mean I'm not going to k*ll you!Giorno: No...JoJo-main: ,You won't k*ll me now.Bruno: What?Giorno: You won't k*ll me. I know it.Bruno: Why do you say that?Giorno: Because you're going to join me.Giorno: I plan on defeating your boss and taking over this city.Bruno: What?!Giorno: In order to get rid of gangs that sell dr*gs to children,Giorno: I'm going to have to become a gangster myself.Bruno: Are you saying...JoJo-main: ,that you're going to join our organization?!Bruno: Are you serious?!JoJo-main: ,Do you even know what that means?!Giorno: What a great view...Giorno: Yes.

Pass!Kids: Thanks!Kids: Thanks.Kids: Thanks!Bruno: Fine.Bruno: I'll report back saying I couldn't find the one who att*cked LucaBruno: and introduce you so you can join the organization.Bruno: However, if they find out at any time that you're going after the boss...Bruno: I'm not going to save you.Bruno: Traitors can't be saved.Giorno: You'll have to deal with your own failure.Bruno: Otherwise, I'll wager on your golden dream andJoJo-main: ,the honorable, golden resolve it took to go so far as to rip off your own arm,Bruno: Giorno Giovanna.Bruno: Our organization oversees every industry in Naples.Bruno: Passione... That's the name of the organization.Bruno: Passione means "passion," but that's not actually related to the boss's name.Bruno: No one actually knows the boss's name, nor does anyone know what he looks like.Bruno: We receive orders from a number of his capos.Bruno: Giorno, the capo who'll be deciding whether you'll join the organizationJoJo-main: ,is a man named Polpo.Bruno: He's in this building.Giorno: But this building...Loom,Sfx: LoomGiorno: It's a prison.Bruno: Correct. Polpo was convicted of a certain crimeJoJo-main: ,and won't be out for fifteen years.Bruno: But he gives me orders from the inside and commands the organization.Bruno: He can leave this place whenever he feels like it, but he doesn't.Bruno: There's simply no reason to.Giorno: But why?Bruno: You'll understand once you go in.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna, you're going to be interviewed by him, and you have to pass.Bruno: It's basically like any other job interview.Bruno: What the interview actually entails will depend on his mood,Bruno: but whatever you do, don't let him find out your true intentions.Giorno: All right.Giorno: Oh, yeah. The Stand ability...JoJo-main: ,That's what you called it, right?Giorno: I never asked how you ended up with that ability,Giorno: but are there others with it?Bruno: That'll also be answered once you get inside...Bruno: If you pass, that is.Cop: First, place your belongings, watch,JoJo-main: ,and everything in your pockets into the tray,Cop: then proceed to the next room for a body check.Lady: Stand right there and raise your hands over your head.Lady: Once you go through that gate, please continue straight down the hall.Lady: N- is where Polpo's cell is.Lady: The room is divided with reinforced glass, but you'll be able to talk to him.Lady: Touching the glass, giving him anything,JoJo-main: ,and receiving anything from him are all forbidden.Lady: You have fifteen minutes.Lady: Once you pass through, the gate will close.Lady: If something happens, please yell.Bruno: I'm going to meet him directly in his cell?Bruno: Not in some visiting room?Lady: You don't know who he is?Polpo: That left arm of yours...JoJo-main: ,Is it injured?Giorno: That's no bed...Loom,Sfx: GwoooPolpo: It's just on your right hand,Polpo: but the fingers are slightly red, like you were holding something.Polpo: Like lines that would be left after holding a bag.Polpo: Which would mean that you were holding a bag in your right hand up until now.Polpo: Why's that?Giorno: Well, uh... You're right.Giorno: I was holding a bag in my right hand,Giorno: because as you observed, I hurt my left arm.Polpo: I envy your ability to be so reckless with your body.Polpo: Would you like some wine?JoJo-main: ,I have some exquisite Chianti Classico.Polpo: It pairs perfectly with some Scamorza cheese and caviar on a cr*cker.Giorno: I've been told that I'm not allowedJoJo-main: ,to give you anything or receive anything from you.Polpo: They're just saying that.Polpo: What people say and what they do...Polpo: are vastly different.Polpo: That's the best and worst thing about people.Polpo: The only downside to being in this cell is.... well...Giorno: Polpo...Polpo: The fact that I can't admire Michelangelo's great painting in the Sistine Chapel.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,It's not that he doesn't need to leave the prison.Giorno: Things would just be the same for him whether he left or not.Giorno: With that body, he might actually be safer in the cell.Giorno: More importantly, how did he get through the door?Polpo: Bucciarati's told me all about you.Polpo: So you want to join our organization?JoJo-main: ,Hmm... Giorno Giovanna, was it?Polpo: Well, why don't we get this interview started?Giorno: What the hell was that?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Did my eyes play a trick on me?Giorno: For a moment, it looked like he took a bite out of his finger along with the cr*cker...Giorno: No... Maybe Polpo is also a Stand user, just like Bucciarati.Giorno: Either way, I can't let him find out that I'm one, as well.Polpo: What do you think is the most important thingJoJo-main: ,when it comes to choosing someone, Giorno Giovanna?Giorno: Is it what they're capable of?Polpo: Oh? And what exactly are you capable of?Giorno: I borrowed a few things when she was patting me down.Giorno: I thought these would be useful for your test.Giorno: Of course, I'll be returning them to her when I leave.Polpo: Do you have anything else?Giorno: Other than that, the only skill I haveJoJo-main: ,is being able to completely fold my ear into my head.Polpo: That's rather amusing.Polpo: But, you see...Polpo: There's something else that's far more important,Polpo: and that's trust, Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: The most important thing when it comes to choosing people is trust.Polpo: In comparison, being smart or being talented means as muchJoJo-main: ,as this piece of cr*cker between my teeth.Polpo: This test is all about seeing how trustworthy you are...Polpo: with this lighter's flame.Polpo: Take it, and make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: Whoa, there.JoJo-main: ,Be extra careful to make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: Fuller, the th-century theologian, said,JoJo-main: ,"He's my friend that speaks well of me behind my back."Polpo: In order to join our organization,JoJo-main: ,you'll have to show how trustworthy you are when we can't see you.Polpo: For  hours, you will hold on to that lighter without letting the flame go out.Polpo: If you can do that, I'll approve of you joining the organization.Polpo: Simple, right?JoJo-main: ,The lighter has plenty of fluid in it.Polpo: All you have to do is sit quietly in your room until  PM tomorrowJoJo-main: ,and make sure the flame doesn't go out.Polpo: If you're a careful man who'll work hard to make sure it doesn't go out,JoJo-main: ,the flame shouldn't go out.Polpo: Which means you're someone we can trust.Polpo: However...Polpo: If you're a man who is taking us too lightly,Polpo: and you fall asleep, sneeze, or knock it over,Polpo: or a sudden wind blows the flame out...Polpo: It means that you're untrustworthy,Polpo: and I can't allow you to join our organization.Polpo: Now, take the lighter.Polpo: This is your entrance exam.Polpo: You have  hours.Polpo: I'm looking forward to seeing you come to visit me again tomorrow at  PM.Giorno: For  hours...Cop: All visitors must go through another body check when they go through the gate.Cop: Once you're told that you can leave the facility,Cop: please continue to the next room and grab your belongings.Giorno: Wait! Polpo didn't tell you anything?Lady: What?Lady: I'm going to pat you down now.Lady: Let me remind you that it's prohibited for you to accept anything from him!Giorno: sh*t! I was under the impression that Polpo bribed all these guys,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,giving me permission to take the lighter out of here!Giorno: Visitor, put your hands up and proceed forward!Giorno: So Polpo's test for me has already started...Giorno: And...Giorno: I have no choice but to go through with it!Giorno: I have to pass this test and get into Passione!Sign: Koichi HiroseSign: Reverb Act Lady: Visitor, hurry forward!Giorno: Just like I hid her ID in my hand where no one could see earlier,Lady: Put your hands up and proceed forward! I will conduct a body check!Giorno: I'll hide this flame!Lady: You're free to go.JoJo-main: ,There are no problems here.Lady: You may leave this facility.Lady: However...Lady: Please open up your hand.Lady: Let me remind you that it's prohibited to accept anything from him.Lady: Visitor, open up your hand! I'm going to check it.Lady: A flower?Lady: A real flower?Lady: Very well. I'll allow you to take that out.Lady: You are permitted to leave this facility.Giorno: I turned the lighter into a flower and hid the flame within it.Giorno: That was too close.Giorno: But is this flame Polpo's Stand ability?Giorno: The wind's definitely bad news!Guy: Hey, Giorno! Perfect timing!Guy: Could you push the shutter button on the camera?Giorno: No.Old: Sorry, but could you help me out here?Giorno: No.Giorno: I finally made it back to my dorm.Giorno: Th-That was close...Giorno: Now the lighter won't fall over, and even if the air moves,JoJo-main: ,the flame will be protected.Giorno: Now, just as Polpo said, I just need to watch over this for the next  hours.Giorno: I know.JoJo-main: ,I'll make sure my window is locked, just in case.Giorno: I need to make sure it doesn't randomly open and allow the wind to blow in here.Giorno: What?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Who's opening my door without even knocking?Giorno: Th-That's—Koichi: Looks like he's out.Koichi: Now's my chance.Giorno: It's that Japanese guy again!Giorno: His name was... Koichi Hirose!Giorno: How did he find out my address?Koichi: Looks like my suitcase and belongings are long gone.Koichi: But my passport might still be around.Koichi: It's probably harder to sell someone's ID.Koichi: I feel like a thief, sneaking into someone's room like this, but...Koichi: No! He's the thief here!Koichi: What's so wrong with trying to find what belongs to me?!Giorno: His passport? sh*t!Giorno: It's in the documents case on top of my desk becauseJoJo-internal/narrator: ,I'd planned to return it to him!Giorno: At this rate, Koichi's going to see the lighter's flame!Giorno: Then he'll probably put it out!Giorno: He'll think it'll set the place on fire!Giorno: What should I do?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I have to hurry up and retrieve that lighter!Giorno: Golden Wind!Giorno: I used Golden Wind to turn the light cord into a snake.Giorno: That bread is pretty delicious.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Good job biting into it!Giorno: Now I'll pull it up with the cord...Giorno: What? sh*t!Giorno: I can't believe this.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,He found the lighter.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,This isn't good.Giorno: I have to make sure he doesn't blow the flame out!Koichi: Oh?Koichi: This mark! The mark symbolizing Japan!Koichi: I found it! It's my passport!Koichi: I-It's burning!Koichi: Thank goodness...JoJo-main: ,Huh?Koichi: That's strange. I could've sworn I saw a lit lighter...Giorno: That was close.JoJo-main: ,He almost extinguished the flame.Giorno: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!Giorno: And to take my first step toward that dream,Giorno: I have to protect this flame, no matter what!Old: Whoa, that was close.Old: Sorry about that. I was cleaning the stairs.Old: I'm glad it was just a slight mist and the water didn't actually hit you.Old: This must mean we've both done good things in our daily lives.Old: Your daily actions are very important.Old: If you weren't careful, you'd probably be wearing that bucket of water on your head.Giorno: Seriously? This isn't good.JoJo-main: ,The flame...Giorno: I wonder if I can ask Polpo to let me try again.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,No...Giorno: If he were that forgiving, he wouldn't have tested me with this.Old: Flame?Old: Is that lighter not lighting up anymore?Old: Is it broken? Is it my fault?Giorno: No, it wasn't you.JoJo-main: ,I'm actually trying to process what happened...Old: But from what I can see, it doesn't look broken.JoJo-main: ,The lighter is still letting gas out.Giorno: What did you just say?Whoosh,Sfx: WhooshOld: Yes, there's still gas coming out.JoJo-main: ,Is this the switch?Old: Did you try pushing it?Giorno: No... It shouldn't be able to light.Old: But look at this fine craftsmanship!Giorno: This whole test depended on if the flame was lit or not.Old: It's a very impressive lighter.Giorno: If I were able to just light it again, there's be no point in this test!Old: I was startled by the size of the flame, but it looks like it's working fine.Old: See?Old: By the way, since you have that lighter, you're not smoking cigarettes, are you?Giorno: Something's wrong.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,It actually lit up again... There has to be something wrong!Giorno: What the...Giorno: That couldn't be his Sta—Black: You relit the lighter, didn't you?Black: I'll give you one more chance.

Sh-sh*t!Giorno: Its movements are slower, but it's still just as powerful!Giorno: I can't move at all!Girono: The shadows! It's in the shadows!Giorno: It can only move within the shadows, but at amazing speed...Giorno: Looks like it can't follow me into the sunlight.Giorno: But the sun's going to set on the other side of the school soon.Giorno: Once that happens, I'll have nowhere to run.Giorno: What'll happen if I force it out into the sunlight?Giorno: It's definitely worth trying.Giorno: But how am I going to drag it out?Giorno: What should I do? It's waiting right there.Giorno: It's waiting there patientlyJoJo-main: ,for the sun to go down.Koichi: Hey!Koichi: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Giorno: Koichi!Koichi: Who's that guy collapsed at the bottom of the stairs?!Koichi: What did you do to him?!Giorno: Hey, don't get the wrong idea!Giorno: That wasn't me!Giorno: That Stand right there atta—Koichi: The wrong idea?Koichi: I saw you talking to that old man!Koichi: I was watching from the window!Giorno: You were... watching?Giorno: Then... did you see the lighter being relit, too?Koichi: Huh?Giorno: Don't step into the handrail's shadow, Koichi!Giorno: Get out of the shadows!Giorno: Sh-sh*t!Black: You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?Black: You have two possible paths.Koichi: Wh-What's going on?Black: The first path is to become a chosen one.Black: Your only other path is death.Koichi: This arrow is...Giorno: Golden Wind!Giorno: It hurts so much...JoJo-main: ,This hurts like hell, but now...Giorno: it looks like I was able to drag you out into the sunlight.Giorno: I turned part of the handrailJoJo-main: ,into morning glories and let them hang down.Giorno: Now you're out of the handrail's shadow!Giorno: So close!JoJo-main: ,There were more shadows nearby, so it managed to escape.Giorno: But it looks like if I can drag that thing completely out into the sunlight,JoJo-main: ,I might be able to win.Koichi: Wh-What was...Koichi: What was that Stand?!Giorno: As you saw, it's trying to att*ck us.Giorno: The old man who relit this lighter was k*lled.Giorno: Because we saw it being relit,Giorno: both you and I are now its targets.Koichi: That's not what I meant.Koichi: That arrow... It's from the Bow and Arrow!Koichi: I didn't know one was in Italy, too...Koichi: What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!Koichi: Is it because of you that another Stand with the arrow appeared?!Giorno: It'll take too long to explain everything...JoJo-main: ,But I don't know anything.Giorno: Do you know something about that Stand?Giorno: And about that arrow?Koichi: Why did you save me?Giorno: Telling me about that arrow is more important!Giorno: The sun's going to set!Koichi: Why did you save me?!Koichi: Don't you dare assume that I feel like I owe a thief like you anything!Giorno: The lighter being lit is because of something I did.Giorno: There was nothing I could've done for that old man.Giorno: I feel awful about it.Giorno: I believe what I did was right, but I feel dark and gross inside.Giorno: But despite that,JoJo-main: ,I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream that I believe to be right.Koichi: Two years ago, I was sh*t with a similar arrow and gained my Stand ability.Koichi: If the person sh*t with the arrow doesn't awaken to that ability, they will die.Giorno: Awaken to the ability?Giorno: That's it!Giorno: That's what it meant by the "chosen one"!Giorno: Someone whose Stand awakened!Giorno: And that must be the motive behind Polpo's test!Koichi: I don't know about the origin of the arrow,Koichi: but I've met a Stand very similar to this one before.Koichi: It's a long-distance remote-controlled Stand!Giorno: Long-distance and remote-controlled?Koichi: It can only carry out simple commands,JoJo-main: ,but it won't stop attacking until it's fulfilled its motive.Koichi: Our best option is to find the Stand user and take them down.Giorno: Sadly, that's not an option.Giorno: The user is in a jail cell. We can't get to him.Giorno: Anyway,JoJo-main: ,that thing won't be able to leave the school building's shadow,JoJo-main: ,so let's head into the sunlight while it's still available.Giorno: Then, before the sun goes down,JoJo-main: ,we'll lure it into the shadow of something that can move,Giorno: and then we'll get rid of that shadow.Giorno: That way, we can drag it into the sunlight.Koichi: Got it!Koichi: I-It's gone!Black: I've got you!Giorno: Wh-What?!Black: You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?Koichi: The crows!Koichi: It hid in the shadows of those crows and moved over there in them!Giorno: Th-This thing...Giorno: It's useless!Giorno: Sh-sh*t!Giorno: While in the shadows, its power and speed are much higher!Koichi: Act !  Freeze!Koichi: My Reverb Act 's ability is to make Stands or people heavier.Reverb: I've made its hands heavier,Reverb: so much that it won't be able to lift a finger from the ground.Koichi: It should let go.JoJo-main: ,I made the entirety of its hands heavier!Koichi: It shouldn't be able to bend its fingers anymore!Giorno: It's strong...JoJo-main: ,It's determined to not let go, no matter what.Black: You have two possible paths...Koichi: I-It's no use!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Any damage inflicted upon the Stand goes right back to the user!Koichi: At this rate, Giorno's legs are going to break!Koichi: Act ! Undo  Freeze...Giorno: No.Giorno: Don't do that, Koichi.Giorno: This ability that makes things heavier... Don't you dare undo it.Giorno: This is perfect.Giorno: This is exactly the ability that I was looking for!Koichi: But your leg's going to shatter!Koichi: Wh-What?Koichi: That tree...Giorno: Golden Wind is an ability that continuously gives life,Giorno: so that tree continued to grow, lived the extent of its life,JoJo-main: ,and is now starting to wither.Koichi: Ability?Koichi: But that tree's at least ten meters away...Koichi: So you got to the tree's roots by digging that hole!Bam,Sfx: BamKoichi: Y-You did it! The shadow's gone!Koichi: It's been dragged out into the daylight!Giorno: You told me there were two paths,Giorno: but sadly, you only have one.Giorno: Koichi, could you move to the right a little?Koichi: Huh? Like this?Giorno: Hmm...Giorno: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Giorno: Bask in the sunlight.Giorno: That's it.Giorno: That's your one possible path.Giorno: Still, I have to wonderJoJo-main: ,if I'm going to be able to join the g*ng now.Giorno: What to do...Sign: PolpoSign: Shadow SabbathKoichi: That arrow...Koichi: The fact that the Arrow is also in Italy meansKoichi: that there'll be even more victims!Koichi: I need to hurry up and tell Jotaro!Koichi: Wh-What are you doing?Giorno: Did you just say there'll be more?Giorno: We defeated Polpo's Stand,which had the arrow.JoJo-main: ,You saw it for yourself.Koichi: Defeated? You've got this all wrong!Koichi: I'll admit that we managed to escape its att*cks because of you,Koichi: but that Stand only stopped attacking because of the sunlight.Koichi: The user isn't hurt at all. They're perfectly fine!Giorno: So Polpo's alive?Koichi: Not only that, but long-distance remote-controlled StandsJoJo-main: ,basically don't affect their users at all.Koichi: He probably hasn't even realized there's been a battle here.Giorno: What?Giorno: So he has no idea at all?JoJo-main: ,He doesn't know I'm a Stand user, either?Koichi: Chill out, would you?Koichi: If he noticed anything, it was probably that his hand felt a bit heavier,Koichi: but he'd have no way of knowing that you and I are Stand users.Koichi: Hey, could you move your finger?Giorno: Sorry, but I still can't let you make your call.Giorno: I'm begging you...JoJo-main: ,This isn't just one enemy.They're an organization.Giorno: If you tell someone, the organization might find out.Koichi: Enemy?JoJo-main: ,Organization?Giorno: I'll tell you and only you, Koichi.The_Next_Day,Sign: The Next DayPolpo: Someone gifted me a special-order pizza.Polpo: Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's see, you were...Polpo: Giorno... Giorno, uh...Giorno: Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: Ah, yes. Sorry about that.Polpo: My head goes blank when I eat.Polpo: Perhaps it's because all my blood goes to my stomach.Polpo: This might sound sudden, but are you a religious person, Giorno?Giorno: I'm not sure... but I'm not very passionate about it.Polpo: What I'm about to say may contradict God's teachings,Polpo: but I'd like you to listen carefully.Polpo: If the most important thing in this world is trust,Polpo: the most despicable thing you can do is insult someone.Polpo: Listen well... To insult or betray someone's trustPolpo: not only hurts their reputation,Polpo: but puts them in a very sticky situation.Polpo: We will not fight others or risk our lives over money, power,Polpo: or having our seats taken at a theater or on the bus.JoJo-main: ,Fighting is truly foolish.Only idiots bother with it.Polpo: But...JoJo-main: ,I will risk my life over being insulted.Polpo: I believe that God forgives even m*rder.Polpo: Don't forget that.Polpo: Congratulations! I will allow you to enter the organization.Polpo: You did bring me the lighter still lit, as I trusted you would.Polpo: You pass.Polpo: That's our Passione organization's badge.Polpo: It proves that you passed.Polpo: You'll be working under Bucciarati for a while.Polpo: How about it? Why don't we celebrate your...Polpo: Did that brat actually protect the flame for  hours?Polpo: Or did he relight it and become a Stand user?Polpo: I couldn't care less about that.Polpo: Young, clueless guys like him are easy to use.Polpo: Either way, we can use him however we want.Polpo: Oh?JoJo-main: ,I could've sworn I closed that...Polpo: The blood does flow to my stomach after I've eaten...Jotaro: You met him again?Koichi: I'm sorry, Jotaro.Koichi: But I can't help thinkingKoichi: that he, Giorno Giovanna, isn't as dangerous as you think he might be.Jotaro: What makes you think that?Koichi: Well...Koichi: Well, I'll tell you that in person.Koichi: Is that all right?Jotaro: All right.Jotaro: If that's what you want to do, that's fine.Jotaro: I'll be waiting.Koichi: Thank you.Koichi: I'll talk to you later.Koichi: Jotaro, back then, I really did think...Koichi: Does this Giorno kid really admire that?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is he sane?Koichi: But I can feel it...Koichi: I can feel that he has a righteous heart.Koichi: I can tell...Koichi: Because I observed three members of the Joestar bloodline back in Morioh.Koichi: The three who exude righteousness from their hearts, as if it were their life energy.Koichi: I could see the same thing in his eyes.Koichi: Without a doubt, the blood that flows in his veins carries the will of the Joestars.Koichi: So I'm going to keep this to myself for a while, like he asked...Koichi: The golden dream that Giorno Giovanna possesses.Koichi: Well, then, maybe I'll go do some sightseeing.The_Next_Day,Sign: The Next DayBruno: Come with me, Giorno Giovanna.Polpo: What was that noise?Polpo: Well, whatever.Giorno: When someone insults you, even m*rder is forgivable?Giorno: I see. What you told me is very important.Giorno: You insulted that innocent old man's life.Giorno: So I changed one of your g*ns into a banana.Giorno: You should savor your last meal as best you can.Giorno: So... Where are we going?Bruno: I'll introduce you to my team.Bruno: They're all Stand users.
04x05 - Find Polpo's Fortune! / Let's Find Polpo's Fortune!QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/24/23 09:15Bruno: Passione is a pretty big g*ng organization.Bruno: First, there are groups made up of six to ten underlings, like my team.Bruno: Then there are capos like Polpo who command those teams.Bruno: They reign over a particular region, making it their turf.Bruno: These teams include specialty teams, such as an assassination team and a drug team.Bruno: Despite being from the same g*ng,JoJo-main: ,I really don't want to involve myself with those teams or their capos.Bruno: And the one who stands at the top is the boss.Bruno: The boss only has contact with the trusted subordinate he considers his right hand,Bruno: and we have no way of knowing who or where he is.Bruno: g*ng members in this city hate standing out,Bruno: as it can quickly lead to their assassination.Bruno: So even the capos will dress normally to blend in with the crowd,Bruno: and some even have cover jobs.Bruno: That goes double for our boss.He won't reveal his identity to anyone.Bruno: If we go snooping around, we're detected immediately.Bruno: I know plenty of guys this has happened to.Bruno: So, Giorno, in order for us to get close to our mysterious boss,JoJo-main: ,we need to be acknowledged.Bruno: We can't defeat the boss unless we earn the acknowledgementJoJo-main: ,and trust of someone close to the boss.Bruno: So first, we're going to get stronger.Bruno: We have to climb up to the position of capo.Bruno: Of course, the two of us can't do that alone.Bruno: A team we can trust...Bruno: That's what we'll need to defeat the boss.JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio  Find Polpo's Fortune!Nar: The news of the incarcerated Polpo's death spread among the other capos.Guy: According to our intelligence team, it might've been su1c1de.Guy : That's not his style.Guy : Polpo was in a special cell. m*rder isn't possible.Guy : Maybe he was plotting to betray the boss.Guy : There aren't many capos as trustworthy as him.Guy : That's even less believable.Guy: More importantly...Guy: Yeah... The problem is his successor.Girl: How do I look?Sign: Rome : a.m.Sale: I just heard that the capos are freaking out.Sale: Apparently, Polpo committed su1c1de.Mario: Huh?Sale: Hey, watch where you're going!Mario: I'm fine.Mario: su1c1de? That fatso?Sale: I told you to watch where you're going!Sale: So I dunno if Polpo was sad because he was in prison or if his obesity made him depressed,Sale: but he apparently wasn't very strong mentally.Sale: He put his own g*n in his mouth and blew his brains out.Mario: You sure it was su1c1de and not m*rder?Sale: It was su1c1de, for sure. From the... autopsy, they call it?Sale: Any expert can tell if it was a su1c1de or m*rder.Sale: Hey, there's a light up ahead.Sale: More importantly, have you heard the rumors about Polpo's fortune?Mario: Rumors?JoJo-main: ,I don't know where the end of the universe is, and I don't know jack about that, either.Sale: Before Polpo went to prison,JoJo-main: ,he converted some of his fortune into jewels and goldSale: and hid them somewhere.Sale: He has a hidden fortune.Sale: It's too much to even deposit in the bank, and he kept it secret from the organization.Sale: No one was stupid enough to look for it while Polpo was alive.Sale: But now that he's dead, that fortune doesn't belong to anyone.Sale: It's free money.Sale: It's said to be worth about five billion lire.Mario: Five billion?Mario: If I had that much money,JoJo-main: ,I'd be heading to Monaco or Japan with a girl on each arm.Sale: Nah, I'd rather work my way up.Sale: If I can climb up to capo with that money, I can taste honey that's even sweeter.Sale: But who knows where it's hidden...Mario: No one knows?Sale: Nah, and this is just what I'm thinking...Sale: But Polpo was such a fatty, he couldn't even go outside on his own.Sale: Do you think he could hide a fortune worth five billion on his own?Sale: He must've had someone do it for him.Sale: Someone who's good at keeping their mouth shut...Sale: Though I'm not sure anyone like that actually exists.Sale: But Polpo liked Bucciarati.Mario: Bucciarati? That's one of the thugs from Naples, right?Sale: Yeah. If anyone could've hidden it, it's him.Sale: And now that Polpo's dead, Bucciarati should be making his move...Sale: to get the five billion lire that's just been freed up.Sale: I'm sure that even Bucciarati wants money.Sale: Hey, Zucchero!Sale: That bastard Zucchero actually left!JoJo-main: ,Did he seriously believe that?Sale: If you're actually going to trail Bucciarati, I'd be careful.Sale: Apparently, he and his subordinates are Stand users.Rome___a_m_,Sign: Naples : a.m.Nara: Hey, Fugo.Nara: It's such a nice day outside.JoJo-main: ,It wouldn't hurt to skip out on studying for one day.Nara: I'm just not feeling it today.Waiter: Thank you for waiting.

Just do as I've taught you.Fugo: You've got a good head on your shoulders.Fugo: Okay, ready? What's six times five?Nara: Six times five... Six and five...Nara: Thirty?Fugo: Correct! See? I knew you could do it!Fugo: You're basically halfway there!Nara: I see! Six times five is thirty! Okay!Mista: Hey, what's the deal with this?!Fugo: What do you mean? It's strawberry cake.Mista: Yeah, I can see that by looking at it!Mista: It's obviously not chocolate cake or cheesecake!Mista: That's not the point here!Mista: There are four slices of cake!Mista: Do they want me to die?!Fugo: Again with this, Mista?Mista: You moron!JoJo-main: ,It's bad luck to choose one from four!Mista: Choosing from five is fine.Mista: Choosing from three is fine.Mista: But when you choose from four, something bad will happen!Mista: When I was a kid, another kid adopted a kitten fromJoJo-main: ,a litter of four that was born in our neighborhood,Mista: and then the cat scratched his eye right out of his head!Mista: Of course, he b*at the cat to death later.Fugo: That's just an old wives' tale.Fugo: If you think about it rationally,Fugo: when people eat a cake one slice at a time,JoJo-main: ,someone's going to have to take one of the last four slices.Mista: That's the thing, though!Mista: This is when the restaurant should be more considerate and just bring us three slices!Mista: Talk about shitty service!Fugo: Jeez... Don't eat it, then.Mista: But I want some strawberry cake!Nara: I did it!Nara: I did it, Fugo! How's it look?Fugo: You're finished?

I'll k*ll you, Fugo.Fugo: You bastard...Bruno: What the hell are you guys doing?!Bruno: I could hear you all the way from the entrance!Bruno: You're bothering the other customers!Bruno: This is the new member I told you about yesterday.Bruno: Let me introduce you. This is Giorno Giovanna.Gio: I'm Giorno Giovanna.Gio: It's a pleasure to meet you.Nara: I'm sorry, Fugo.Fugo: No, I should apologize.Fugo: Please forgive me, Narancia.Nara: I'll study even harder, so teach me again.Bruno: Hey!Bruno: I'm the one who brought him here, so be respectful!Guy: Mr. Bucciarati.Bruno: What is it?Guy: There's a phone call for you.Bruno: All right, thanks.Bruno: Make sure you guys properly greet Giorno!

Ha, you're two years younger than me.Gio: Thank you for the tea.Abba: What's wrong?JoJo-main: ,You just thanked me for the tea that I so generously poured for you.Abba: Since you already thanked me for it, you'll just have to drink it.Abba: Or do you not want to drink it since it's not very hot?Mista: Maybe he doesn't want to drink it because he doesn't want to be one of us.Bruno: What the hell are you guys doing?!Gio: It's nothing.Gio: He went to the trouble of pouring this tea for me.Nara: No freakin' way!Bruno: What did you guys do?Nara: Gross! He actually drank it!Mista: D-Dude, you're hilarious! Did you seriously drink it?Fugo: No, there's no way he could have!Fugo: Hey, how'd you do it? Where'd you hide it?Msita: Hey, come on. Just tell me! Okay?Gio: Who knows?JoJo-main: ,You're all keeping your abilities secret, too, aren't you?Abba: So he's a Stand user?Gio: What I did with the liquid in the cup is...Gio: I used my ability to change one of my teeth into a jellyfish,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,which is  percent liquid, to suck it up.Fugo: Is it, like, some ability to move things?Mista: Open your mouth. There's no hole in there, is there?Nara: You actually drank it for real?Bruno: I'm not sure what it is,JoJo-main: ,Was that your favorite or something?Bruno: but there's something about Giorno Giovanna that makes him hard to dislike.Fugo: If you guys tell me about your powers, I might tell you mine.Giorno: You're cautious. I respect that.Mista: Does Bucciarati know?Giorno: Yeah.Bruno: They're not exactly a team yet, but we don't have any time to wait.Bruno: This has to be decided now.Bruno: Quit screwing around. We're going out.Nara: Huh? Where?Bruno: Follow me and you'll find out. Hurry it up.Lady: Bucciarati! How are you?Guy: Oh, Mr. Bucciarati!Scooter: Hey, Bucciarati.Scooter: Come by my shop again sometime!Bruno: I will!Mista: Hey, what are we going to do about a car?Abba: We got a loaner.Fugo: Since a certain someone destroyed our last one.Giorno: As I suspected, the citizens trust him.Mista: Hey, I told you that wasn't my fault!Menini: Bucciarati, this is my friend,Menini: and she's in a bit of trouble because her son is b*ating her.Menini: Right?Bruno: I see.

Hurry up and tell us where this boat's headed!Bruno: Fine. We're far enough away from the shore now.Bruno: We're headed to Capri.Abba: Capri?Fugo: We're not going there as tourists, are we?Bruno: Correct.Mista: Then why are we going there?Bruno: This morning, the capo Polpo committed su1c1de.Mista: What? su1c1de?! Polpo did?Nara: No way!Fugo: But why?Bruno: It doesn't matter why he d*ed.Bruno: Polpo was a capo who did things that'd get him k*lled.Fugo: But what does he have to do with why we're going to Capri?Bruno: Polpo actually has a secret fortune.Bruno: It's worth...Bruno: ten billion lire!Abba: T-Ten billion?Bruno: I'm the only person who knows where it's hidden.Bruno: I'm the one he ordered to hide it.Bruno: That ten billion now belongs to us!Bruno: With that money, we can claim the rank of capo!Nara: A-Awesome!Fugo: He's definitely a man who's going to the top.Fugo: Just like I thought, he's going to become a capo!Abba: He earned this opportunityAbba: by working diligently enough to be acknowledged and liked by a capo.Abba: Amazing.Mista: Seriously? This took a sudden turn for the awesome.Nara: Where is it?Nara: Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?Bruno: I can't tell you that yet.Bruno: Rumors of his hidden fortune have made the rounds in the organization.Bruno: No one can find out before we secure the money.Nara: B-Bucciarati!Bruno: Hey! Something's wrong!Bruno: Did something happen, Narancia?Mista: Narancia!Mista: What the heck are you doing?Mista: H-Hey, come look at this!Gio: There's only one shoe left...Abba: Give that here, Giorno!Fugo: I don't quite understand what's going on.Fugo: Where did Narancia go?Bruno: You guys didn't see it?Bruno: To me, it looked like Narancia got pulled into this box.Fugo: What?Mista: That's impossible!JoJo-main: ,He didn't randomly fall into the ocean, did he?Abba: Narancia, where are you?Mista: Hey, Narancia! If you're just fooling around and hiding... Hup!Mista: Hurry up and answer us!Bruno: Narancia, where are you?Giorno: Narancia! Answer us!Fugo: Mista?Fugo: What are you doing, Mista?Fugo: Mista?Fugo: Where did you go, Mista?Bruno: It can't be...Fugo: Come on, Mista!Fugo: Why are you messing around now—Bruno: Fugo?Bruno: Hey, Fugo!Abba: What?Giorno: What's going on?Bruno: Abbacchio, Giorno, stay close to each other!Bruno: We're being att*cked!Bruno: There's someone hiding somewhere on this boat!Bruno: This is a Stand att*ck!Abba: But why now?Bruno: The money.Bruno: Someone found out that I knew where the money was,Bruno: and they're trying to steal it.Bruno: Which means they're from the organization.Abba: Does that mean they've been quietly tracking us ever since we were on the shore?Bruno: Looks that way.Bruno: They probably grew impatient because I wouldn't just say where the money is.Bruno: They intend to get rid of everyone but me, then make me cough up the location.Bruno: And they can take their time, since we're on the ocean with nowhere to run.Abba: Are you saying Narancia and the others are dead?Bruno: I didn't say that.Bruno: But it's for ten billion.JoJo-main: ,They'd even k*ll someone from their own organization for that.Giorno: No, Narancia and the others are alive.Giorno: They're somewhere on this boat.Giorno: I don't know if this person is trying to use them as hostages,Giorno: but they're alive.Abba: Giorno Giovanna,Abba: how the hell can you be so sure about that?Giorno: I used my Stand to turn Narancia's shoe into a fly.Giorno: The fly is trying to return to its owner, Narancia.Giorno: If Narancia was truly dead, it wouldn't be flying around searching like that.Bruno: Can you locate him?Giorno: He's alive... He's alive, but...Giorno: It's not going down into the cabin or in the locker.Giorno: The fly's not trying to stop...Giorno: It keeps flying around that area looking for Narancia.Abba: What the hell is his ability?Bruno: Just shut up and listen.Giorno: Narancia is somewhere near the entrance to the cabin.Giorno: That's a fact.Giorno: But for some reason, the fly can't find him, so it's lost.Giorno: I think it's safe to assume that we'll find the enemy wherever Narancia is.Giorno: Which means the enemy isn't just randomly hiding behind something.Bruno: I see.JoJo-main: ,So if we don't figure out the mystery behind the enemy's ability,Bruno: getting too close without knowing could get us k*lled.Giorno: Correct.JoJo-main: ,But the fact that their ability requires them to att*ck while hidden is a shortcoming.Giorno: If we can figure out the mystery behind it, we'll be able to defeat them.Bruno: Abbacchio, your Stand...Bruno: might be perfect to defeat such an enemy.Giorno: Defeat?Giorno: Can you solve this mystery with your ability?Abba: Hard to say...Bruno: Damn it, Abbacchio!Bruno: You'd better not be hung up on stupid sh*t at a time like this!Abba: Stupid sh*t?JoJo-main: ,No.Abba: This has to do with my safety.Abba: I can't just carelessly reveal my Stand abilityAbba: in front of a stranger that I can't trust.Abba: Bucciarati,Abba: I don't know what made you trust this guy,Abba: but I don't consider him a part of the team.Bruno: If we don't figure out the enemy's location, we're going to be k*lled!Abba: And I'm saying that's just this untrustworthy brat's hypothesis.Abba: He just came up with it out of fear. He didn't see anything.Bruno: Abbacchio!Abba: The enemy is just hiding somewhere in the cabin.Abba: I'll find them and take care of them.Giorno: If we get close without figuring out the mystery, we're going to get kil—Abba: Shut your mouth!Abba: You stupid little brat...Giorno: I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.Abba: What are you talking about?Giorno: You can solve the mystery, right?Giorno: I'm counting on you!Bruno: Giorno!Bruno: What the hell are you doing?!Crunch,Sfx: RoarBruno: G-Giorno!Bruno: There's an enemy over there!Bruno: sh*t!Bruno: Giorno's in trouble!Bruno: Abbacchio...Abba: Giorno Giovanna... You're one crazy bastard.Abba: All this to prove yourself...Abba: What the hell is wrong with you?

Go around the back.Abba: Freeze!

It hurts, God damn it!Pimp: I'm gonna die...Pimp: I'm gonna die...Pimp: I'm gonna die...Pimp: I'm really gonna die...Nar: That moment was the end of Abbacchio's future.Nar: Not only was he charged for being a dirty cop,Nar: but he allowed his partner todie because of his actions,Nar: and that was a cross he'd have to bear for the rest of his life.Nar: It was then that his body and soul plunged into darkness.Nar: No matter who d*ed, or even if he lost a limb or two,Nar: his heart would probably never be moved again.Bruno: Abbacchio, wasn't it?JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio   Moody Jazz's CounterattackGio: You can solve the mystery, right?Gio: I'm counting on you!Bruno: Giorno!Bruno: What the hell are you doing?!Sfx: RoarBruno: G-Giorno!Bruno: Giorno's in trouble!Abba: Giorno Giovanna...Abba: You're one crazy bastard.Abba: All this to prove yourself...Abba: What the hell is wrong with you?Gio: Y-You bastard...Gio: Th-This Stand...Bruno: Use your Golden Wind to defend yourself!Bruno: I-Impossible!Bruno: Giorno... Where are you?!Abba: Don't go down there, Bucciarati.Abba: Actually, stay back.Abba: It's not that I trust Giorno Giovanna as one of us,Abba: but Giorno seems to believe that you won't abandon him.Abba: He does some pretty crazy sh*t.Abba: Giorno Giovanna...Abba: What if that had actually k*lled you?Abba: So, again, Bucciarati, don't go down there.Bruno: Th-That fly...Bruno: Narancia's shoe...Bruno: Giorno's powers haven't disappeared yet.Bruno: Does that mean Giorno's alive?Abba: They're here, Bucciarati!Abba: Narancia and the enemy are below deck!Bruno: Zipper Man!Bruno: Narancia, Fugo, Mista, and Giorno aren't here!Abba: Maybe they're right under where the fly is.Bruno: It's just like Giorno said.Bruno: The enemy's not just hiding in some locker or behind something to att*ck...Abba: Hey. The fly's coming around now.Bruno: That's strange...Bruno: Where is the enemy going?Bruno: How and where is the enemy hiding?Abba: Regarding this enemy's abilities...Abba: I hate to admit it, but it looks like I'll have to accept what Giorno was saying.Abba: I'll use my Stand to solve this mystery!Abba: But... This spot's bad news, Bucciarati!Abba: Moody Jazz!Abba: Does Narancia from five minutes ago work?Bruno: Yeah. That should be fine.Abba: Is the fly all right?Bruno: It's heading toward the bow.Bruno: Now's our chance. Do it quickly.Abba: Yeah.Bruno: What's that noise?Abba: His headphones.Abba: Five minutes ago, Narancia was listening to his boombox.Nara: Huh? What's wrong with this thing?It just stopped working!Nara: Why'd it stop?Bruno: This isn't it.Nara: I just bought it!Bruno: Narancia was att*cked a little after this.Nara: Damn it! How dare he sell me something like this?!Abba: I'll try fast forwarding and searching.Nara: That stupid old guy from the electronics store is gonna regret this!Bruno: That ten billion now belongs to us!Bruno: With that money, we can claim the rank of capo!Nara: A-Awesome!Nara: Where is it?Bruno: That was my voice.Nara: Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?Bruno: It was right after this conversation that Narancia was att*cked!Bruno bg: I can't tell you that yet.Bruno: We'd better be able to see just how he was att*cked, Abbacchio.abba: My Stand replays everything.abba: We'll be able to see everything, from Narancia's sweat to his pulse.Abba: And it'll follow him everywhere.Bruno: It's about time.Bruno: Let's get behind Narancia.Bruno: He's about to be att*cked!Bruno: L-Look!

So he's inside the pipe.Bruno: This is the answer to our mystery.Bruno: His nails, flesh, and bones are all floppy like a condom,Bruno: even his shoe and his belt buckle,Bruno: but he still has a pulse.Bruno: Just like Giorno said, he's alive.Bruno: So that's what's going on...Bruno: The enemy is also doing this to his own body,Bruno: hiding in pipes or between the planks or walls,Bruno: and he's dragged in Mista, Fugo, and Giorno, as well.Bruno: That explains why Giorno's fly can trace the general area,Bruno: but can't pinpoint exactly where they are.Abba: We figured out the enemy's ability.Abba: Now all we have to do is chase the enemy,Abba: find out where Narancia and the others are and save them,Abba: and then b*at the sh*t out of the guy.Abba: I'm resuming Moody Jazz's replay.Bruno: Chase? Wait a second, Abbacchio!Bruno: While you're replaying, you can't att*ck or defend yourself. You're totally defenseless!Bruno: It's dangerous to go into the pipe.Abba: I know exactly where Moody Jazz is going.Abba: When that bastard is near, use your zippers to open the floor and get him!Abba: We can't defeat the enemy if we don't chase him, Bucciarati!Abba: It went left.Abba: That's where he got Mista.Abba: Moody Jazz is going right underneath that ring buoy.Abba: It's going around toward the cabin where it got Fugo and Giorno.Bruno: So the enemy is moving them around while keeping them captured.Abba: It's moving much slower...Abba: That's where the bastard was hiding earlier.Abba: On the inside of that rope fastener!Abba: The enemy's right below the deck there!Bruno: The enemy's coming for us.Bruno: I'm not sure if he knows that we know his ability, but...Abba: Bring it on!Abba: The pipes! Cut through them and get them outta there!Bruno: Zipper Man!Bruno: Th-They're not there!Bruno: Where's the enemy, Abbacchio?Bruno: Where's your Moody Jazz?

Better hope youdon't get dragged down!Mario: Wh-What the hell are you doing?!Bruno: I didn't punch the deck earlier to find where Abbacchio was.Bruno: It was to put a hole in the bottom of the boat.Mario: A h-hole?!Bruno: Abbacchio figured out where you were,Bruno: and he was kind enough to show me...Bruno: where you are and how to know for sure.Bruno: It was Abbacchio's blood.Bruno: Abbacchio intentionally hurt his hand and showed me the blood trail.Bruno: The blood trail didn't go down below the deck!Bruno: It was cut off right on the deck!Bruno: So what does that mean, and where was he dragged to?Bruno: I rented the yacht that was on the left.Bruno: Abbacchio realized that when he looked up at the sky.Bruno: I know where you are, so if you don't wanna drown,Bruno: you'd best come out.Bruno: There were two boats!Baaaaaa,Sfx: BwaaaaaMario: You bastard...Bruno: You were hiding by thinly covering this yacht with another one.Bruno: You were traveling through the thin gap between them and attacking us from there.Bruno: No wonder we couldn't figure it out.

I'm going to sneak up to the security watchhouseJoJo-main: ,and hide in its shadows so that no one sees me.Guy: Is there anyone waiting for a yacht named Lagoon?Guy: We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero on the Lagoon!Guy: Please come to the boat watchhouse!Guy: Is there anyone waiting for a yacht named Lagoon?Guy: We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero on the Lagoon!Mista: He might decide to be cautious and not answer the radio call...Guy: Please come to the boat watchhouse!Mista: Or he might get excited and run out, thinking the hiding placeJoJo-internal/narrator: ,of the ten billion lire has been found.Mista: This is a gamble,Guy: Is there anyone waiting for the Lagoon?Mista: but the one who comes to the boat watchhouseJoJo-internal/narrator: ,to answer that radio call is our guy.Guy: We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero!Mista: Giorno, if anyone comes near the watchhouse, give me a signal.Guy: If you're waiting for the Lagoon, please come to the boat watchhouse!Mista: I'm gonna sh**t the guy who takes the radio call!Mista: But Bucciarati told me to not k*ll him, so I'll miss any vital points.Mista: Or at least, I'll try.Gio: No one's making a move yet...Gio: No one's heading over there.Guy: Is there no one?Guy: No one's waiting for the Lagoon?Guy: There's a transmission from Mr. Zucchero!Gio: No, there's no one. Nothing.Gio: He's supposed to be somewhere on this island.Gio: Is he just being too cautious to answer the radio call?Sale: Did something happen, Zucchero?Sale: Why did you request an announcement?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is there a problem? Over.Gio: What's going on?Gio: No one's heading toward the watchhouse.Gio: He's there! How?!Gio: This isn't good. Does that watchhouse have a back entrance?Gio: He's already inside the watchhouse!Gio: It's too dark to see his face.Gio: Mista hasn't realized he's in there!Gio: At this rate, the guy's going to realize this is a trap and run!Gio: I have to let Mista know!Mista: What? The guy's coming to answer the radio call?Mista: Which one is it?Mista: Who's heading toward the watchhouse?Gio: N-No!Gio: He's not heading there!Gio: He's already inside!Gio: Don't come out!Gio: He's by the window!Sale: That guy is...Sale: one of Bucciarati's guys!Sale: Didn't Zucchero take care of him on the yacht?Gio: Mista! Behind you!Gio: He's on the radio! Mista!Gio: Damn it! He can't hear me.Gio: It's better than him not noticing!Gio: He's already there!Gio: Mista! He's already on the radio!JoJo-main: ,Come on! Pass, pass, pass!Mista: Go, Six b*ll*ts!Menace,Sfx: Menacingb*llet: Here we go!b*ll*ts: sh**t!Bazoo,Sfx: Bazoob*ll*ts: Yay!b*ll*ts: Heck yeah!b*ll*ts: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!Gio: D-Did he get him?Guy: Wh-Who the hell are you?!Guy: Wh-What was that noise?Mista: g*nshots.Mista: Did it bother you?JoJo-main: ,It probably wasn't as loud as in the movies.Mista: But if it did bother you...Mista: I'm sorta busy right now,Mista: so I'll listen to your complaints later.Mista: Guess Giorno just can't wait.Mista: So there was a rear entrance...Mista: Meaning he came through this door and got on the radio.Mista: Either he was being cautiousJoJo-main: ,or he's just used to always going through the back door.Mista: Still...JoJo-main: ,Good job, b*ll*ts!b*llet: Yay!b*llet: Leg!b*llet: Leg! Hey, hey!b*llet: We got his right leg!b*llet: We sh*t him right through his right leg!Mista: Yeah, you sure did.Mista: Now he won't get away!Mista: There are a bunch of people outside...Mista: And this side is basically a cliff.Mista: There's no way he could climb up.Mista: He must be scurrying about right now.Mista: If he were to hide somewhere...Mista: He must be in that truck.Mista: If he's a Stand user, his Stand is probably close-range and extremely powerful.Mista: If he was a remote-control type, he would've att*cked me by now.Mista: In that case, the guy who just got sh*t in the legMista: is probably hiding behind the truck,Mista: trying to lure me as close to him as possible so that he can att*ck.Mista: Well, it's not like he's going to get me, even if I get close to him.Mista: He's probably just beyond there.Mista: But so long as we don't know what his Stand is,Mista: going over there alone isn't a safe plan at all.Mista: I should wait for Giorno and—Mista: Well, I guess that option's out.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,The guy's in the driver's seat.Mista: He must've jump-started the engine.Mista: It'll be bad news if this truck gets away right now.Mista: Damn it! This isn't good!Mista: I haven't seen his face yet!Mista: Giorno probably hasn't, either!Mista: I don't know what his Stand is yet, but I don't have a choice!Mista: This is for the ten billion and Bucciarati!Mista: Eat lead!Gio: Mista!

We only have one target!JoJo-main: ,Give it your all!Sale: You're aiming for the inside of my mouth.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Am I wrong?Five: He opened his mouth on his own!Six: He's not going to defend himself!Seven: We'll just have to charge right in!Sale: I knew it.Sale: Ow!Sale: I knew you were aiming there...Sale: At the inside of my mouth!Sale: That's what any normal person would think...Sale: That I shouldn't be able to use my ability to affix things inside my body.Sale: It's a pain in the ass to guard myself, so I opened my mouth for you!Mista: Impossible...JoJo-main: ,He can even affix things inside his mouth to guard against the b*llet?Sale: Damn... This really freakin' hurts!Sale: But... it looks like you weren't lying about that being your last b*llet.Sale: I see you're not sh**ting again.Sale: You done now, Mista?Sale: If you're finished...Sale: The launching power on this baby...Sale: is more than ready, Mista!Sale: Take this! Release!One: He really did let down his guard.Six: He let his guard down because Mista was out of b*ll*ts!Seven: We just wanted to get closer to him,Seven: because the closer we get, the better we can aim!Sale: Wh-What?!Sale: Wh-When did they—Sale: sh*t! They're too close!One: Here we go, boys!One: Aim!Sale: Arts & Crafts!

I've handed her over to you.Bruno: Handed her over?Gio: Bucciarati!Gio: Could that guy be...Gio: No, not "guy."Gio: She must be the boss's daughter!Bruno: That's her?Trish: Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?Peri: That's fine, Trish.Bruno: For now, stay by her side.Bruno: The order is already in effect.Peri: Bucciarati.Peri: Her name is Trish Una, and she's fifteen years old.Peri: "Una" is her mother's maiden name, not the boss's family name.Peri: Trish hasn't met the boss once in her life.Peri: Bucciarati, as you're well aware, no one knows who the boss is.Peri: But of course, even the boss has a past, especially when he was young.Peri: Two months ago, a woman named Donatella d*ed of illness in Calabria.Peri: A few days before her death, she asked that a man named Solido Naso be found.Peri: That man was Trish's father.JoJo-main: ,I'm sure she was just trying to look out for her daughter's well-being,Peri: but...bruno: Naso doesn't exist.JoJo-main: ,Because that was one of the aliases that the boss used when he was young.Bruno: Correct?Peri: Beware of anyone trying to look into the name Naso.Peri: Anyone with any status in Passione is very cautious about that.Peri: Just trying to look into the boss's past would meanJoJo-main: ,challenging the organization itself.Peri: Word about Donatella eventually spread.JoJo-main: ,Word spread even more when it came out that she had a daughter.Peri: Of course, the boss caught wind of this, as well.Peri: The boss's decision was immediate.Peri: Through a few other men, he gave me the orderJoJo-main: ,and placed her in my custody soon after her mother's death.Peri: The boss must've known immediately.Peri: He didn't know she existed until now,JoJo-main: ,but he knew for a fact that Trish was indeed his daughter.Peri: And right after I took Trish into my custody,Peri: we found out that someone was after her life.Peri: If the boss's order had come even thirty minutes later,JoJo-main: ,Trish most likely would've been kidnapped by them, and then...Peri: m*rder*d.Bruno: Who is it? Who's after her?Peri: People who have betrayed the organization.Peri: We don't know how many of them there are.Peri: They're trying to defeat the boss and take over his drug trafficking routes.Gio: dr*gs...Peri: They're under the impression that Trish knows a secret about the boss.Peri: They want information so that they can defeat the boss.Peri: But Trish is just a frail little girl who knows nothing.Bruno: How long will we be guarding her?Peri: One week... Actually, it could even be less.Peri: It's just until the boss finds those traitors and gets rid of them.Peri: Leave this island immediately and hide her somewhere.Peri: The only ones who know that Trish is with you are the boss and myself.Gio: Mr. Pericolo.Gio: You said that order was supposed to go to Polpo, correct?Gio: Which means...Peri: The enemies are Stand users...Peri: I'd say that's a safe assumption.Peri: They're most likely moving as a team, as well.Peri: We don't yet know how many there are.Peri: I don't have a Stand ability.JoJo-main: ,This is all I can do for you.Peri: I'll contact you again if I learn anything else.Trish: Um...Fugo: M-Me?Trish: Yes. Is it with you... um...JoJo-main: ,Am I going to be with you now?Fugo: Yes, that's correct.Fugo: But it'll be all six of us.Fugo: We will be risking our lives to protect you.Trish: I see.JoJo-main: ,Then would you mind taking off that jacket?Fugo: My jacket? Why?Trish: Just hurry up and take it off.Trish: It's not as if I want to see you shirtless or anything.Fugo: V-Very well.Trish: I don't have a handkerchief, so go buy one for me.Trish: Also, some stockings and Givenchy Blush No. .Trish: The stockings need to be reinforced at the thighs.Trish: Get the latest issue of Italian Vogue, too,Trish: and some mineral water.Trish: I'd rather die than drink one that's not from France, though.Trish: When you're done gawking at the scenery, go buy that stuff for me.Gio: Guard the boss's daughter, huh?Gio: So we suddenly have a connection to the mysterious boss that I've been looking for.Gio: This is definitely worth doing.Gio: If we can see this through,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Bucciarati will be able to gain the same level of trust that Polpo had.Gio: But if we fail, it'll mean our lives.Gio: All six of us are well aware of that fact.Form: What's your problem?

That's my ability.Illu: All the things in here are objects that have no life.Illu: You and I are the only living beings here.Illu: That's because I didn't allow anyone else.Illu: I only allowed you, and you alone, to come in.Illu: Which means... your Stand ability was left outside!Illu: This is my Mirror Man!Fugo: Purple Smoke has appeared outside the mirror.Fugo: Then there should be some way to fight!Sign bot: Mirror ManSign top: IllusoNar: Pannacotta Fugo was born into a wealthy familyJoJo-internal/narrator: ,that owned a huge home in the suburbs of Naples.Nar: On top of being born into a life of luxury,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,he was born with high intellect, having an IQ of .Nar: It appeared as though he lived the perfect life.Nar: But the weight of the expectations that his parents and othersJoJo-internal/narrator: ,put on Fugo were slowly crushing his young heart.Nar: At times, Fugo would experience fits of rage that even he didn't understand,Nar: but he would do everything he could to control them and get by.Nar: Then, when he entered university just after turning thirteen,Nar: that rage went out of control in the worst possible way.Creep: Fugo.Fugo: Professor.Creep: What are you doing here so late?Fugo: I'm working on the assignment due next week.

But, well... I think our meeting is fate.Bruno: Would you like to join my team, Pannacotta Fugo?Bruno: I want your intellect and knowledge.Fugo: Mr. Bucciarati, was it?Fugo: Joining a g*ng doesn't sound so bad, but I've already made up my mind.Fugo: I'm going to live on my own, not bothering with anyone else.Bruno: Oh? And why is that?Fugo: I told you.Fugo: When I lose my temper, I do horrifying things.Fugo: If I were to join your team, I might even end up k*lling you.Bruno: In that case, let's see if that'll actually happen.Bruno: Come with me, Fugo.Bruno: I'll bring out the best in you,JoJo-flashback: ,including that fierce, impulsive rage of yours.Nar: Those words moved Fugo's heart.Nar: After that, Fugo underwent Polpo's test and gained Purple Smoke.Gio: So this is Fugo's Stand...Gio: Fugo's not here, but his Stand appeared for some reason.Abba: Since that thing appeared, Fugo must be okay for the time being, but...Abba: Damn it!

It just started attacking out of nowhere!Abba: This isn't good. We really shouldn't stay here.Abba: We're getting out of here! Come on!Gio: I don't know what you're talking about!Gio: There's something in that mirror!Gio: We need to find where Fugo is!JoJo-main: ,That's far more important right no—Abba: Stop talking back to me, you little sh*t!Abba: I don't care what happens to you,JoJo-main: ,but I'm trying to be nice and warn you, since you don't know what's going on!Abba: It punched it! Run, Giorno!Illuso: I see.Illuso: So you activated your Stand outside the mirror.Illuso: But... that doesn't mean a thing!Illuso: It doesn't matter what your Stand tries to do with its ability.JoJo-main: ,It will never be able to hit me.Illuso: But I can hit you as many times as I like and finish you off!Illuso: A crow?Illuso: Why did a crow fall?Gio: A crow just suddenly...Abba: Stay back.Abba: When Purple Smoke uses its fists, no one can stay nearby.Illuso: What the hell is with these corpses?Abba: It's a k*ller virus.Abba: That's Fugo's Stand, Purple Smoke's ability.Gio: A virus?Abba: Look at its hand.Abba: When it hits something with its fist, that capsule breaks open,Abba: and the virus comes spilling out!Abba: The virus disperses into the air and enters your bodyJoJo-main: ,through inhalation or skin contact.Abba: It then multiplies rapidly.Abba: It infects its host within thirty seconds, then kills them instantly.Abba: And once the virus spreads, it doesn't matter who's nearby, be they friend or foe.Abba: Just like those crows, all of your metabolic functions will shut down,JoJo-main: ,and you'll die as you rot from the inside out.Abba: That includes your Stand, too.Gio: What's its range?Abba: Five meters.JoJo-main: ,Right now, Fugo should be controlling his StandJoJo-main: ,somewhere within five meters of his opponent.Gio: That's definitely important, but what's the range on the virus?Gio: How close do you have to be to be infected by the virus?Abba: At this distance, we should be safe.Abba: The virus that comes from that capsule diesJoJo-main: ,within a few dozen seconds of exposure to an average indoor level of light.Abba: So those crow corpses will soon be disinfected by the sunlight.Abba: Savage!Abba: It att*cks like an expl*si*n, and then disappears like a storm.Abba: It's a Stand that personifies Fugo's violent nature.Gio: What's it doing?Abba: I think it's trying to wipe off the drool that dripped on its leg.Abba: It always looks pissed off, but it's apparentlyJoJo-main: ,really high-strung, and really cares about being clean.Abba: I guess you could say that's the Stand's idiosyncrasy.Gio: It doesn't look like the Stand itself is very intelligent...Abba: It's just a reflection of his violent side.Abba: That would also mean Fugo's isn't able to see Purple Smoke.Abba: He's not controlling it properly at all.Abba: If he was, he wouldn't let it do that.Illuso: This corpse...JoJo-main: ,This crow...Illuso: Is it sick?Illuso: Was it infected by some virus or bacteria?Abba: I knew it... Fugo's unable to control it.Abba: It just att*cked some random spot again.Gio: Wait, is it actually random?Gio: There must be something in that mirror!Illu: Now the mirror got att*cked from the outside...Illu: But it's no use, Fugo.Illu: That's just a normal mirror,the kind you can find anywhere.Illu: No matter what your Stand is doing out there...JoJo-main: ,No matter what ability it may use...Illu: Not even viruses can enter Mirror Man's world!Fugo: Abbacchio, Giorno, please get my message...Fugo: Please make sure you don't get dragged into the mirror!Abba: We need to hurry, Giorno!Abba: Hey, Giorno!Abba: Don't just stand there! Let's go!Gio: Let me ask you this... Where are we going?JoJo-main: ,To get the key?Gio: You're willing to abandon Fugo, who's in danger right now?Abba: Watch your mouth, you bastard.Abba: Listen up. Our mission is to get the key and safely get that girl to the boss!Abba: I want to save Fugo as much as you do,Abba: but getting that key is paramount right now!Abba: Even if I was the one currently being att*cked instead of Fugo,Abba: I would want you guys to abandon me.Gio: I beg your pardon...JoJo-main: ,but I don't believe that's true!Gio: Fugo is indeed in danger, but he hasn't lost!Gio: We should risk our lives and save him!Gio: And making any movements when we don't know the enemy's abilityJoJo-main: ,is dangerous to us, as well.Abba: No! All three of us being taken out is the worst possible outcome!Abba: I'll say it again! We're moving on! Come on!Gio: And I humbly decline!Gio: We're going to solve this mystery, save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!Gio: That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!Abba: I have seniority here, so in this situation, what I say goes!Abba: Are you still going to decline?Abba: You'd better be prepared!JoJo-main: ,That is, if you manage to survive!Illu: I'll ask you one more time, Fugo.Illu: What are you looking for here?Fugo: I have no intention of telling you.Illu: I see.Illu: Very well. There are still two others.Illu: I just need the last one standing to tell me.Illu: You're finished. Take this!

There are still two others.Illu: I just need the last one standing to tell me.Illu: You're finished. Take this!Illu: Footsteps... Someone outside the mirror is running.Illu: Does that mean your friends decided toJoJo-main: ,abandon you so that they could go get something?!Illu: They're heading toward the dog mosaic.Illu: That settles it.Illu: Fugo, you're basically done for already.Illu: I'm going to go get whatever that thing is first!Fugo: W-Wait, you bastard!Fugo: Abbacchio... Giorno...Abba: Where is it? Where is this key?Abba: There it is. That must be it.Abba: A mirror?JoJo-main: ,Has that always been there?Illu: What is that? A key?Abba: What?Illu: I see.Illu: I guess I just have to take that key from you.Abba: That's... It couldn't be...Illu: Now that you've seen me,Illu: you're finished, too!JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio   Mirror Man and Purple SmokeAbba: Sh-sh*t!Abba: Damn it...JoJo-main: ,I'm starting to understand the enemy's ability.Abba: So he's inside the mirror...JoJo-main: ,Assuming that's even possible.Abba: Fugo must've been dragged into the mirror and disappeared,Abba: separating him from his Stand.Abba: Regardless, right now, I need to grab that key!Illu: Shattering the mirror actually worked in my favor, Abbacchio.Illu: Anything reflected becomes an entrance to this world.Illu: Now that it's in shards, I have even more entrances to grab you from!Illu: And I'll give you, and only you, permission to come into the mirror!Illu: There! I've brought you in.Illu: I'll be taking that key, too!Illu: Wh-What?!Illu: O-Only a Stand can grab the neck of another Stand!Illu: There's no way you could grab Mirror Man's neckwhen I'm the one who dragged you in here!Abba: Shattering the mirror didn't actually work in your favor!Abba: It just means the space you can look outside from became smaller!Abba: You couldn't see who you dragged in here, could you?Abba: You gave permission...JoJo-main: ,for just me to enter?!Illu: Th-That's...Abba: Grazie! I'll happily get dragged in!Abba: Moody Jazz!Illu: sh*t! That's a Stand!Abba: Inside the mirror...JoJo-main: ,So it's a world where everything's reversed.Abba: Of course we couldn't know.JoJo-main: ,There's no way we'd comprehend this ability until we were actually att*cked.Abba: Fugo must be in here, too.Abba: So, how do we get out of here?Abba: If I have to k*ll you to get out of here, that's fine.JoJo-main: ,That's why I sent Moody Jazz in there!Illu: The ability to transform into others...Illu: Well, sh*t. You got me.Abba: Looks like your Stand itself isn't that strong.Abba: So, what? Can it only defeat powerless humans?Abba: Well, what are you waiting for? Get on your feet and come at me!Illu: Listen up... Like I said at the start, you're already done for.Illu: I must say, I was a little surprised when it was your Stand that came in,Illu: but that doesn't change a thing!Illu: The reason I'm not standing is so that I can crouch down.Illu: I'm crouching because I need to!Abba: Well, yeah.Abba: You're bent over to make it easier to kick you.Illu: I was crouching so I could pick up this shard of the mirror!Illu: Hey, why are you so surprised?Illu: Is it because I have this arm?Illu: I'm sure you're very familiar with this arm!Illu: I told you! Anything that reflects becomes an entrance!Illu: If I can get your reflection with a different shard,Illu: that becomes another entrance!Illu: Do you get it now?Illu: It's your arm that I dragged in here!Illu: To make sure you can't move about, I'll only allow half of your body to come in.Illu: As for your Stand, I permit half of it to get out!Illu: Now your Stand won't be able to move!Illu: The key's mine!Abba: Damn it. He's going to take the key.Abba: That doesn't just mean we failed the mission.Abba: It also means that Giorno will end up being correct!Gio: And I humbly decline!Gio: We're going to solve this mystery, save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!Gio: That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!Abba: Damn it... My pride's not going to stand for that!Abba: I'm not letting him have that key!Abba: I swear on my pride and my dignity that I, Leone Abbacchio,Abba: will protect this key!Illu: It's true. Because Mirror Man uses all its energy to drag someone in,JoJo-main: ,it doesn't have much destructive power. That is indeed one of its traits!Illu: But if I do this to you, we don't exactly need strength to k*ll you off instantly!Illu: If we just s*ab this in with the strength of a four-year-old child, it's pretty easy.Illu: I win! Thanks for telling me where the key i—Abba: Something wrong? Go on, finish me off!Illu: What the hell are you doing, Abbacchio?!JoJo-main: ,How dare you hide it from me?!Illu: Even if you can move with your current body, it won't be much!Illu: I'll be able to tell immediately! Get it?!Abba: Hide?Abba: What are you talking about?Abba: What exactly did I hide, and where?Illu: What the hell are you doing, you bastard?Illu: Let me see that hand!Illu: Seriously, what the hell are you doing, you bastard?!Abba: Did you lose something?Abba: Did you find what you were looking for? Well?Illu: Why did he do that to his own hand?Illu: Wait... If he chopped off his own hand,Illu: his Stand's hand outside the mirror is...Illu: It can't be...Illu: Its hand is gone!Illu: Don't tell me...Illu: I-It has the key!Illu: And it's going back!Illu: If I remember correctly, a newbie named Giorno is just around the corner!Illu: He chopped off that hand to give him the key?!Abba: You should've sliced open my throat when you had the chance.Abba: If you had, my Stand's hand would've stopped moving.Abba: Whoops, so close. But you're a bit too late.Abba: That was the sound of the key falling to the ground.Abba: The key is going to get picked up!Illu: That's some bullshit you pulled off!Illu: But I'm not letting that brat named Giorno get away!Illu: I'll drag him in here, too!Abba: Do you understand now, Giorno, you shithead?!Abba: All that matters is that one of us returns safely.Abba: If you return safely with the key...Abba: The most important thing is to fulfill the mission.Illu: Hey, Abbacchio.Illu: Can you even imagine what's going on over here?Illu: You sure have a loyal companion.Illu: After you worked so hard to deliver the key...Illu: What do you think's going on over here?Illu: Not a damn thing!Illu: That brat's not running away at all!Illu: It looks like he doesn't have a clue what's going on.Abba: Giorno! Get the hell out of here!Abba: Take the key and run!Illu: He won't hear you when you're screaming inside this mirror!Abba: Sh-sh*t...Illu: Now then, there are two possible actions I could take.Illu: First is disposing of Giorno after I get the key.Illu: Second is slitting Giorno's throat first, then safely retrieving the key.Illu: Let's see...Illu: I guess I'll slit Giorno's throat first!Illu: He's noticed me.Illu: I'll allow only Giorno to enter!Illu: I've dragged him in!Illu: Slice open his throat, Mirror Man!Illu: Wh-Wh-What?!Illu: H-He's... That's impossible!Illu: It's the virus! G-Giorno...JoJo-main: ,He's been infected by Fugo's Purple Smoke!Gior: You're not getting the key!Gio: And Fugo, Abbacchio, and I... will safely return to the others!Sign: Pannacotta FugoSign: Purple SmokeAbba: Giorno Giovanna... That brat doesn't understand anything!Abba: You're going to die if you infect yourself with Purple Smoke's virus!Abba: My heart d*ed along with him back then.Abba: I don't feel anything anymore.Abba: I don't feel a damn thing, even though I've lost my hand...Abba: The only time I can feel at easeJoJo-internal/narrator: ,is when I'm following the orders of something great and absolute.Abba: Because then, all I need to do is be a soldier who doesn't have to think for himself.Abba: Meaning...Abba: Getting the key and protecting the boss's daughter...Abba: Carrying out this mission is the most important thing.Abba: And yet Giorno... That stupid brat...Abba: He chose to put himself in danger toAbba: save Fugo and me, rather than taking the key back safely!Illu: Damn you, you stupid brat!JoJo-main: ,How dare you come in here infected?!Illu: Are you out of your damn mind?!Illu: Now I'm infected, damn it!Gio: Ah, yes. You seem to be experiencing the same symptoms as me.Gio: Apparently Purple Smoke's virus infects your whole body within thirty seconds.Gio: It's over now.Gio: It was over as soon as you dragged me in.Fugo: Shards of the mirror that Purple Smoke shattered...Fugo: Did Giorno put them back together?Fugo: When the enemy chased after Abbacchio, he took some shards with him.Fugo: Giorno must've realized that!Fugo: He then figured out the enemy's ability from that,Fugo: then infected himself with the virus andFugo: allowed himself to be dragged into the mirror!Fugo: Because there's no other way to defeat this enemy!Illu: Damn it! Of all the underhanded...Illu: But don't underestimate me.Illu: It's not too late yet.Illu: I need more resolve, but it's not too late yet!Illu: Mirror Man! Allow only me to leave this mirror!Illu: But don't allow the virus!Illu: The part of me that's infected is not allowed to leave!Gio: That's not good!JoJo-main: ,If he gets outside, the virus will be separated from him!Illu: Abbacchio lopped off his own hand to get the key.Illu: So, I, Illuso, c-can do the same thing!Illu: This is nothing!Fugo: Giorno! Grab him!Fugo: He got away...Fugo: Giorno... After you...Fugo: risked your own life to come in here...Gio: So... he stepped outside the mirror.Illu: Th-That was really close, but, ha!Illu: My resolve... My resolve wins in the end!Illu: This is nothing!Giorno: I figured he'd go outside.Gio: That's for the best, though. He's going down, no matter what.Gio: Now that he's stepped outside, there's a chance I might survive!Gio: Fugo! Now that he's outside, Purple Smoke can follow him!Gio: Finish him off!Fugo: I can't, Giorno.Fugo: I can't tell where he is from inside here.Fugo: I have no way to att*ck him!Gio: I know where he is.Gio: Golden Wind, who's outside, turned that brick into a snake.Gio: That's why it's moving.Gio: Snakes can tell where humans are by sensing their body temperature.Fugo: Got him!Illu: What?!JoJo-main: ,A-After I built up the resolve to chop off my own arm and came out here...Illu: This... This can't...Illu: S-Stop it! Stop! Damn it!Illu: I'm going to be infected! I-If that virus capsule bursts...Illu: I-It looks like luck hasn't completely abandoned me!Illu: If Mirror Man can stop this thing's punch even for a moment...Illu: If I can just block it once...Fugo: Let him have it, Purple Smoke!Illu: Mirror Man! Use everything you have left!Illu: I...Illu: I did it...Illu: I stopped it! Now I just need to take this arm...Illu: into the mirror!Illu: Huh?Illu: What?!Illu: What?!Illu: B-But I blocked its punch...Illu: After I built up the resolve... to leave the mirror!Fugo: W-We did it! We're outside the mirror!Fugo: We defeated him, so his ability disappeared!Fugo: B-But Giorno, Purple Smoke's virus has already spread throughout your body.Fugo: Once you've been infected, even I can't do anything about it.Gio: Yes, Fugo, and this is how it should be.Gio: This...Gio: Him leaving the mirror worked out for the best.Gio: Once I was infected and he dragged me into the mirror,Gio: his defeat was inevitable.Gio: But I was glad when he refused to admit defeat and left the mirror.Gio: Since the mirror world was undone before I d*ed,Gio: I was able to encounter this snake.Fugo: Th-That snake...Fugo: It's alive, even though it's surrounded by Purple Smoke's virus!Gio: I created this snake from the brick where Purple Smoke's capsule was broken.Gio: Since it was born from a place that was covered with the virus, it won't get sick.Gio: Do you know what that means?Fugo: That snake has immunity!Fugo: And if we take blood or cells from something with immunity...Fugo: We can create a serum that'll stop the virus from spreading!Gio: Golden Wind!Gio: Extract the serum from this snake and inject it into me!Fugo: Giorno Giovanna...Fugo: I thought he was some newbie that I just couldn't figure out,Fugo: but he comes up with the most insane ideas and pulls them off...Fugo: And there's something I can trust behind that.Fugo: It's not something that's spoken.Fugo: He has true loyalty within him!Fugo: Just like Bucciarati did back then!Fugo: Giorno! You have my utmost respect after risking your life!Gio: No, Fugo...Gio: I'm not the one who risked my life here.Gio: I just made a prediction and followed through.Gio: The one who truly risked his life here... was Abbacchio.Gio: His hand is in grave condition right now.Gio: He's the one who risked his life to protect the key...Gio: And if he hadn't carried the key all the way here,Gio: we couldn't have defeated the enemy.Gio: Please don't worry about me... and go tend to his wounds...Fugo: Giorno!Fugo: Are you okay, Giorno?!Abba: Damn it, Giorno...Abba: I was going...JoJo-main: ,to b*at the sh*t out of you...Abba: But with my hand like this, I guess I can't.Abba: I'll just have to do it later...Nar: Thus, they got the key they were ordered to retrieve!

I'm sure they'll do anything...Bruno: And without a second thought.Bruno: This leaves us two choices.Bruno: One, take Trish and somehow get off this train.Bruno: Two, we find this enemy, even though we don't know their range, and dispose of them.Mista: Obviously, we'll go with the second choice.Mista: If we want to take her and run,we'll have to stop the train.Mista: It's too dangerous.Mista: Assassinating them is more definitive,Mista: with my Six b*ll*ts!Bruno: Yes, you're right.JoJo-main: ,But we don't have any time.Bruno: We're aging at an alarming rate...Nara: B-Bucciarati...Nara: M-My hands...Nara: Th-They're crumbling!Nara: They're falling apart!mista: You're right, Bucciarati.

I'm going!Gio: No... If they're attacking everyone indiscriminately with age...Gio: They might end up k*lling her as well, despite her being the target.Gio: There's some kind of prerequisite to how fast we're aging.Gio: I'll tell you what I think...Gio: I think the enemy is differentiating betweenJoJo-main: ,men and women by the difference in their body temperature.Gio: I read somewhere that women have more fat in their bodies, which makes themJoJo-main: ,less susceptible to temperature fluctuations.Gio: Apparently women also age better and live longer than men.Gio: Don't you think it's been a little hot?Gio: The enemy is differentiating the aging speed based onGio: slight differences in body temperature.Gio: All that matters is that the men age faster and she ages slower.Mista: Yeah, that sounds about right,Mista: but then why are you and I aging at different rates?Mista: Are you insinuating that I'm a girl?!Trish: Change in body temperature...Trish: Come to think of it, our bodies were slightly cooler...Trish: Because we had something cold to drink.Trish: Narancia didn't have anything to drink.Mista: Th-That's...Mista: Giorno, it's exactly like you said!Mista: We're aging slower because our bodies were slightly cooler!Mista: Cool everyone down! Cool everyone down with ice!Bruno: Hold it, Mista!JoJo-main: ,You're going to have to take that ice with you!Mista: Th-This is all that's left?Bruno: It doesn't change the fact that we have to dispose of this enemy.Bruno: Mista, you're going to take that ice and defeat the enemy...Bruno: Before the ice melts and you lose your Stand power!Mista: Just the driver... It doesn't look like anyone else is in here.Mista: It's so muggy...Mista: This Stand really is attacking indiscriminately.Mista: I wonder if this turtle is aging, too...JoJo-main: ,But they say that turtles live for , years.Mista: Guess they live longer than us.Pesci: Damn it...Pesci: What's Bro thinking? This is so dangerous.Pesci: What's he gonna do if I get old, too? Damn it...Mista: The air conditioner?JoJo-main: ,If I turn it on inside the driver's cab, everyone in the turtle will cool down,JoJo-main: ,and that might slow down their aging!JoJo-main: ,There it is!Pesci: Something took the bait!Mista: Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!Mista: A d-different Stand than the one that's aging us?Mista: There's another one? There are two of them?Mista: There are two enemies?!

Do you understand?Melone: It means to make them die, or to get rid of them.Melone: Next... Oh, we have some children's games.Melone: A spinning top and baseball.Melone: This is bowling, and these are ice skates.Melone: Oh, dear! Look at how handy these things are when you use them like this!Melone: The ones who d*ed are the pieces of sh*t.Melone: You use "piece" when there's only one and say "pieces" when there's more than one.Melone: Do you understand?Melone: But you can k*ll them in whatever way your instincts tell you to.Melone: However, you are forbidden to att*ck this girl named Trish.Melone: You need to capture her alive.Melone: There is also a newbiewhose face we haven't seen yet.Melone: They're with Bucciarati as well, so you need to find them and k*ll them.Sign: I have to pee.What should I do?Melone: What should you do?JoJo-main: ,I mean, just do it?Melone: Babies pee all the time.Guy: But it doesn't look like the lock's been broken...Anita: H-Hey, what is this?!Anita: There's something leaking from the ceiling of this stupid train!Guy: I don't see anything...Anita: I-It stinks!Anita: What is this?!

I don't hear her anymore...Melone: She was too good of a mother!Melone: It's good that she taught him the desire to k*ll first, but this is too early!Melone: H-Hey!Sign: Bucciarati's DNA is currently not moving...It's idle somewhere up north.Melone: What am I going to do with you?Melone: I guess I can't deny your talents, though.Melone: It looks like the a*t*matic tracking of Bucciarati's DNA has kicked in.Melone: It's a hassle, but Babyhead's son is an invincible, remote-controlled Stand.Melone: Nothing can defeat you!Sign: MeloneSign: BabyheadNara: Let's just steal one already.fugo: Are you stupid?Fugo: Word would spread in no time and go right to the enemy.Fugo: Then they'll just be waiting to ambush us!Mista: That's true.Abba: Fugo's got a good point.Nara: Then let's hear what Bucciarati wants us to do.Fugo: Wh-What are you doing, Giorno?Gio: If we steal only one, we'll be caught immediately.Gio: But if we steal a hundred...Gio: If it isn't just a single car that disappeared,Gio: and if they're all found in pieces at different locations,Gio: the search for the missing cars will be much harder,Gio: and it should give us plenty of time to get to Venice.Nara: I see...Mista: That definitely beats hitchhiking.Abba: Whatever.Abba: Giorno, you tell Bucciarati.Abba: Here.Abba: We're going to go get a car.Bruno: Please get down from the chair.Bruno: It's very dangerous outside right now.Trish: Listen, Mr. Bucciarati.Trish: If I were to ask you a dumb question, would you be able to answer it?Bruno: It depends on the question.Trish: What am I supposed to do if I need to go to the bathroom?Trish: You aren't suggesting that I use a diaper, are you?Bruno: I see... That's a very good question.Trish: Good. I'm glad you understand.Bruno: Let's make the closet a toilet.Bruno: Please, go ahead.Trish: Go ahead?Bruno: You said you had to go to the bathroom.Bruno: I don't know where it leads underneath that, but I'm sure the turtle will be fine.Bruno: It might actually get nutrients from it.Trish: I have no idea what you're trying to say...Gio: Bucciarati, we've procured a car.Bruno: All right. Once we confirm that we're safe, let's head out.Gio: Understood.Gio: That bike... When did it show up here?Gio: Where's the person who was riding it?Bruno: Giorno, is something wrong?Bruno: Trish?Bruno: What the hell?!Bruno: Trish!Bruno: I-Impossible!Bruno: Trish!Bruno: Zipper—Bruno: sh*t... It's a Stand, and a remote-controlled one!Bruno: But this power isn't remote-controlled.

Trish!Gio: I had the turtle in my hands this whole time...Gio: I'd know if they came outside.Gio: Could the enemy have already used some kind of att*ck?Gio: Golden Wind!Melone: Di molto!Sign: {\an\pos(,}I've captured the boss's daughter, Trish,and Bucciarati as well.What should I do now?Melone: Di molto! Well done, Babyhead!Melone: Get away from there immediately, of course!Sign: I'm currently inside a turtle...There's one human waiting at the exit of the turtle.Sign: {\an\pos(,)\fs}I've never seen him before.He's going to find me on my way back. What should I do?Melone: Someone you've never seen?Melone: That must be the newbie.Melone: If he finds you, you're going to have to get rid of him.Sign: {\an\pos(,)\fs}Roger.{\fscx}I will get rid of the newbie who's waiting at the turtle's exit.Melone: But make sure you do it quietly so you aren't found by the others.Melone: Capturing Trish takes top priority.Melone: I'll have them head over there as well, just in case.Gio: I thought I felt a presence there, but...Baby: No, you were correct.Gio: Everyone! There's an enemy here! We're being atta—Gio: D-Did it take... my throat?!Fugo: Are you done yet, Mista?Mista: Don't rush me!Abba: Is something wrong?Nara: Nah. Giorno's waving.Nara: I'm pretty sure Bucciarati's telling us to hurry up and get the car.Mista: I just told you not to rush me!Sign: {\an\pos(,)\fscx}The att*ck was successful. It's very quiet,because I stole part of his throat.Melone: Di molto! Well done!Gio: Impossible! I destroyed the cabinet, but it's still not showing itself?Gio: And how am I not able to see it the moment it att*cks me?Gio: Where is it hiding, and how is it carving out pieces of me?Gio: Carving out pieces... Which means...Smack,Sfx: {\c&H&}ShpangMelone: So you've carved away his leg and eye, too?Melone: Di molto! Well done! Now, come back, Babyhead!Sign: {\an\pos(,)\fs}The att*ck was unsuccessful.{\fscx}Obviously, he's figured out what I am. What should I do?Melone: What?Sign: The newbie outside has removed the key from the turtle's back.Sign: Apparently, when someone removes the key, only living things can leave.Sign: My body is floating upward.What should I do?Melone: I'm not sure what you're saying... Living things?Melone: You're a Stand! It doesn't matter if you're living or not.Sign: That's true, but right now,I have the eye that I stole from him.His eye is living.Gio: I knew it... It was that cabinet.Gio: I see now...Gio: It's not that I couldn't see the enemy.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I'd seen them all along!Gio: This ability chops up humans and reconstructs them into something else!Sign: Melone.What should I do?What should I do?What should I do?Melone: Don't panic! Who cares if he figured out your ability?Melone: The newbie hasn't been able to breathe for a while, and he's missing a leg, right?Melone: Just defeat him already and steal the turtle, along with Trish!Baby: Roger.Gio: Golden Wind!Gio: It's dodging by splitting itself apart!Gio: Which means...Gio: G-Guys...JoJo-main: ,I need to somehow... let them know...Gio: That had some effect!Baby: No, that was just a rock.Gio: Sh-sh*t...Gio: Trish is going to get taken...Gio: At this rate, Bucciarati will be eliminated!Gio: I-It's strong...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is it... invincible?Baby: I will leave the newbie's corpse here.Baby: As planned, I've quietly captured Trish.Melone: Di molto! Good!Baby: I'm heading back to the train you're on now, Melone.Gio: Reconstructing humans into objects...Gio: Your ability gave me an excellent hint.Gio: Your ability is similar to my Golden Wind.Gio: They're very much alike in the way that they both recreate something.Gio: Due to the hint you gave me, and almost being k*lled,Gio: it would appear...Gio: that I've grown a little.Baby: M-Melone, did you hear that?Baby: I totally forgot earlier, but now I know the newbie's Stand ability.Melone: What about the newbie?Baby: His button has become an eye! In his hand! It became an eyeball!Melone: Hey, Babyhead, what are you talking about?JoJo-main: ,What's this about the dead newbie?Baby: He inserted the eye into his face!Smack,Sfx: {\c&HDD&\c&HC&}Rum{\c&HACF&}bleJoJo-main: ,He did the same with his throat and leg!Baby: His ability is to create life!Baby: He created his own parts!JoJo-main: ,His ability is the exact opposite of mine!Melone: Hey, who the hell are you talking about?Gio: You're not getting away! Golden Wind!Baby: The newbie... He...Baby: He's been revived!Baby: A-Are you listening, Melone?Baby: He made parts of the motorcycle into roots!Baby: I can't separate them!JoJo-main: ,I have to get rid of the parts that are stuck!Baby: I need to get away from the bike!Gio: Did it turn into a rock again?Baby: This isn't good. He's going to try to pick up the turtle.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I'll k*ll him before he picks it up!Melone: Calm down, Babyhead!Melone: Let him pick up the turtle.Baby: What do you mean?Melone: The moment he picks up the turtle, tear him apart for good.Gio: Oil's pouring out. That's not good!Melone: Make sure he can never get up again!Baby: I got him!Baby: It was only a little bit, but how dare you freak me out, you bastard?!Baby: Now, I'm going to rip your head—Gio: I've learned a lot from your ability to turn humans into objects.Gio: I'm not sure if it's fate or if our Stands were attracted to each otherJoJo-main: ,due to their similarities that we met.Gio: But because of you, my Golden Wind was able to grow.Baby: Wh-Where did it go?Baby: I just tore off your wrist. Where did it go?Gio: Tore off?JoJo-main: ,That's incorrect.Gio: I intentionally let it go.Gio: I'd like to give you a little advice.Gio: You should probably use your hand to defend yourself, rather than att*ck me.Baby: D-Don't you dare underestimate me!Baby: Take this!Baby: What?!Gio: The hand that I cut off has already become another living creatureJoJo-main: ,and invaded your body.Gio: Yes.Gio: As you can see, it turned into a piranha!

Floor it! Faster!Gio: I told you, I can't!Gio: If we slip, we're going to lose even more spee—Mista: Just do it, damn it! I said floor it, so floor it!Ghia: I told you! This is useless!Mista: Number Three and Number Two up on the roof, come back!Mista: I hope you get to share a hot, passionate kiss with the road.Mista: Your face will be well-acquainted with it at the speed you're going.All: Yeah!Mista: Good.

Eat lead again!Mista: He opened the trunk! Which means...Mista: Sh-sh*t! He got into the trunk! Stop the car, Giorno!Mista: He's gonna freeze the brake pedal so it'll be useless again!Ghia: There's no need for that...JoJo-main: ,Gunslinger Mista.Ghia: Seeing as Trish isn't here, this is what I was planning to do in the first place.Ghia: Shatter—Mista: G-Giorno!Gio: It only cracked?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Is he invincible?Gio: How can I destroy this armor?Mista: Giorno!

More! More!Mista: If you don't want to die, get me more!Mista: If you don't grow more, we're gonna die, Giorno!Ghia: Gotcha!

I see.Mista: Giorno, if you release your ability, the short grass turns back into car parts.Mista: Therefore, we can sh**t them into you!Ghia: What?!Mista: D-Did that do it?Gio: No, it's shallow.JoJo-main: ,I think we can at least get away for now,Gio: but Mista, this just bought us some time!Gio: Let's get the thing quickly, then get out of here fast.Gio: That same strategy won't work again the next time he catches up.Gio: Please go, Mista!Mista: The disc will show up somewhere if we destroy the lion statue.Mista: I'll retrieve it, then hide somewhere in the city.Mista: If I have a few dozen seconds, I can do this.Mista: But will hiding be enough to get away from that guy?Mista: It might just work, but it might not.Mista: More importantly, this guy's way too dangerous.Mista: It'll be even worse if he ends up running into Bucciarati and the others.Mista: We need to end him now!Mista: This is our only chance!Gio: Wha— Mista! What are you doing?!Mista: Your ability is perfect? That's impossible!Mista: If you've completely encased yourself in ice, how are you able to breathe?Mista: There it is.

This photo should be a hint...Gio: sh*t. This is the worst possible scenario.Gio: Mista's currently acting out of despair.Gio: He's decided to take responsibility for this, even if it costs him his life.Gio: But the only ones who can open up a pathJoJo-internal/narrator: ,in the darkness are those with resolve.Gio: Things are getting interesting.Gio: We're going to have to make some sacrifices,Gio: but my resolve, as well as Mista's,Gio: will open up a path in the darkness!Sign: GhiaccioSign: White IceGhia: What the hell is this?JoJo-main: ,It was embedded in there?Ghia: In one of the cuts or gaps in the statue?Mista: Damn it!

You're being released.Mista: You're the one who bailed me out?Bruno: Yes. I saw the incident on the news and decided you acted out of self-defense.Bruno: It means you are incredibly skilled with a p*stol and full of life.Bruno: But a guy like you probably wouldn't last two years in prison.Bruno: That's why...Mista: You pulled some strings.Mista: Do you belong to some organization?Bruno: Come with me.JoJo-flashback: ,There's an excellent ristorante nearby.Bruno: I like the way you eat.Bruno: The bruschetta here is great, too. Do you still have some room?Mista: Yeah.Bruno: Pardon me.Guy: Yes, sir?Bruno: Could I get some bruschetta for him... I should get some for them, too.Bruno: Could I get four orders of bruschetta?Bruno: No, make that five.

Everything worked out in the end.Nar: Mista learned that people have predetermined destinies.Nar: When they're young,Nar: people may find themselves at a standstill or taking the long way around at times,Nar: but they ultimately end up traveling the path they were destined to walk.Mista: I can see it! I can see the path perfectly!Mista: I can see it for sure this time!Mista: It's there, Giorno!JoJo-main: ,I see the path I need to take through the darkness!b*ll*ts: Yeehaw!Sfx: BatoomSfx: BamSfx: BamSfx: ShankSfx: cr*ckSfx: cr*ckGhia: You guys don't seem to understand.Ghia: The air is frozen because of the extremely low temperature.Ghia: Just like this.Ghia: If I put air that's been frozen solid in my suit and melt it,Ghia: the air turns back to normal!Ghia: If I take it in like this...Ghia: Just like a diver who has an air t*nk on their back,JoJo-main: ,I don't need a breathing hole anymore!Seven: The hole!Three: He deflected the b*ll*ts!Six: Six of them! O-Oh, no!Ghia: I hope you have the resolve for this, Mista!Ghia: It's over.Mista: Yeah, my resolve is there, Giorno.Mista: If you hadn't given me your resolve,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I wouldn't have been able to see this path.Mista: The path toward the resolve to be willingly sh*t by my own b*ll*ts...Ghia: I-I can't see!JoJo-main: ,The blood's frozen to me and hardened...Mista: The path through the darknessJoJo-main: ,isn't the path for the b*ll*ts to get through your wall of ice.Mista: I-It was to splash your face with my blood!Ghia: sh*t!

Haven't you forgotten something?Ghia: The b*llet you sh*t last is still...Ghia: Straight into your head!Ghia: I win!Ghia: There's no wound?!Ghia: Wha—Gio: Mista...Gio: Your resolve is shining upon the path,Gio: even brighter than this rising sun.Gio: And it's shining on the path...Gio: that we're meant to take!Ghia: What the hell?!Gold: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Mista: Recently, I... started noticing...Mista: that despite Giorno Giovanna...Mista: being a newbie...Mista: things always seem...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,to play out exactly how he says.Mista: The resolve I showed just now was also partly Giorno's.Mista: It was making its way into my heart before I even realized it.Mista: It almost feels like he's my capo, even more so than Bucciarati,Mista: and he kept me moving.Mista: What the hell is his deal?Mista: Well, I guess that doesn't matter right now.Mista: It's not my style to think too much about stuff.Gio: Mista, we safely retrieved the disc, thanks to you.Mista: Hurry and fix me up. I-I can't breathe...Mista: I wouldn't have been able to show that resolve without your ability.Mista: Hurry and fix me up, before I actually die...Gio: Of course.

Be more gentle! Be more gentle, damn it, Giorno!Gio: I told you, I can't.Gio: You're a gangster, for crying out loud. Please quit fussing.Gio: There are about  more wounds,JoJo-main: ,so you'll have to remove some of your clothes for me to plug the rest.Nara: Bucciarati! I'm picking up two signals...JoJo-main: ,It doesn't look like there's anyone else.Bruno: Proceed, but carefully.Bruno: I'm assuming it's Mista and Giorno.Bruno: I'm sure they're bored out of their minds waiting for us since nothing's happening.Mista: Ack!

Ladybugs bring good luck.Bruno: This brooch that's been given life with Golden Wind's ability will act as a tracking device.Fugo: Bucciarati.Bruno: What is it, Fugo?Fugo: I thought this was a good opportunity to say this.Bruno: Why so formal? What is it?Fugo: I knew that you'd become capo someday,Fugo: and I know you'll be able to complete this mission.Abba: Of course he can.Fugo: Let's aim for an even higher position in the organization!Bruno: Yeah...

Tri—Bruno: Wh-What?!Bruno: Trish... No... What's—Bruno: Trish and I should be the only ones here.Bruno: No one other than the guys on my team knows we're...Bruno: No... It can't be!Bruno: Could the boss...Bruno: In order to make sure he stays completely invisible...Bruno: Did he have us protect his daughterBruno: in order to ensure that he could finish off his daughter himself?!Nar: Bruno Bucciarati was born as a fisherman's son in a suburb of Naples.Nar: His father wasn't the best at dealing with people,Nar: but he was an earnest and honest fishermanNar: who tried to protect his family from the cruelties of this world.Dad: Bruno.Bruno: Dad.Bruno: You need me to fix the net?JoJo-flashback: ,Got it.Nar: His mother was very kind, and Bruno loved his conversations with her.Nar: He always looked forward to the bedtime stories she read to him before going to sleep.Mom: All right, go to sleep, now.Nar: But...Nar: It occurred when Bucciarati was seven.Dad: So what are you going to do now?Mom: Well... I want a change, so I'm going to leave this town.Nar: After ten years of marriage, his parents divorced.Nar: As for the reason, only his parents would know the answer to that.Dad: What are we going to do about Bruno?Nar: After a discussion, Bruno's parents had him make a decision.Mom: Bruno, your father and I both love you,Mom: but we're going to be living separately now.Mom: Who do you want to live with?

Bruno, you should really think about this!Mom: You like me better, don't you?Bruno: I'll stay here with Dad.Mom: No...Bruno: Mom's strong...JoJo-flashbackinternal: ,She should be able to make it anywhere.Bruno: But...Mom: All right, I'm leaving.Mom: I'll come back once a month to visit.Bruno: Okay.Nar: As Bucciarati had instinctively figured,Nar: two years after his mother left, she remarried a man from Milan.Nar: He would end up only seeing his mother at Christmas after that.Nar: As for his father, because his wife left him for the city,Nar: he became determined to send Bucciarati to a good school.Bruno: Dad, I think customers are going to come by soon.Dad: Oh, I guess it's about that time...Bruno: I'll reapply the nets.Dad: All right. I'll let you handle this.Nar: Up until then, he'd only been a fisherman,Nar: but in order to earn money for his son's tuition,Nar: he started taking tourists and other fishermen on his boat.Nar: And the wheel of fate continued to turn.Dad: Sirs, that island isn't good for fishing.Dad: There are better—Guy: Whatever, man.Guy: We wanna go fishing over there.Guy : Just shut up and take us.Guy: Got it?Dad: R-Right...Nar: That evening, Bucciarati's father would be rescued by the Coast Guard,Nar: his body riddled with b*llet holes.Guy: He's been sh*t seven times in his arms, shoulders, chest, and torso.Nurse: We got an operating room open!Bruno: Dad! Dad!Guy: There are b*ll*ts still in his body.Bruno: Dad!Lady: For now, please just wait until the surgery's finished.Lady: Be strong. Can you give us contact information for the rest of your family?Bruno: Dad...Cop: Forensics is coming by later, so give them this as evidence.Nurse: Yes, sir.Cop: Thanks.Nurse: Right.Bruno: H-How did this happen?Cop: Good evening. Are you his son?Cop: We found this at the scene.Cop: Apparently, your father witnessed a drug deal.Cop: He was sh*t so that he wouldn't talk.Cop: Your father is a very important witness.JoJo-flashback: ,We don't exactly want him to die, either.Cop: I'm sure he'll be okay.Bruno: My father was sh*t because of something like that?Nar: Luckily, Bucciarati's father survived.Nar: Despite being sh*t seven times, none of the wounds were fatal,Nar: and the boat that found and rescued himJoJo-internal/narrator: ,happened to have supplies to treat his wounds,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,allowing him to survive until he got to the hospital.Nar: He was graced by good luck all around.Nar: But in terms of Bucciarati's life, it might've been better if his father had d*ed.Nar: There are certain sticky situations where you don'tJoJo-internal/narrator: ,have the opportunity to choose the right path.Guy: Fishermen have way too much energy, damn it.Guy: I'll keep watch! Just hurry up and do it!Guy: You've got some nerve, making us come here so late at night.Guy: Go to hell already!Guy: Wh-Who the hell are you?Guy: A k-kid?

I won't bother them again!JoJo-flashback: ,I'll forget about that family!Bruno: Good. You can't regret anything once you're dead, after all.Bruno: If you're also a g*ng member—Bruno: Those are...Bruno: Hey!

They can't have cake, either?Mista: I wonder if their bodies actually function better, then.Nara: Then what do those guys do about shoes or handbags?Nara: Those are made from leather.Abba: Well, if they're vegetarians because they feel bad for animals,Abba: they probably wear sneakers and carry backpacks instead.Mista: Man, they're intense.Mista: So would you have old ladies dressing like basketball players, then?Mista: They'd never let them into a restaurant looking like that.Bruno: Giorno, being all scared won't make anything happen.Bruno: Let's just eat for now.Gio: Yes, I know... Still, we need to be on our guard.Gio: For example, there's a possibility someone could've poisoned our food.Guy: Y-You bastard!

There's an enemy nearby!Nara: There's a shark in my soup!Nara: Li'l Bomber!Bruno: Giorno! Get Trish inside the turtle!Bruno: Abbacchio, cover the right! Mista, guard the left!Mista: Where, Narancia?

Look!Mista: Narancia's tongue! It's gone!Mista: On top of that, I don't think he's breathing!Gio: This isn't good.Gio: I can use Golden Wind to create parts for his tongue,Gio: but it'll take time to finish.Mista: Hey, come on! He's about to suffocate here!Gio: Mista, do you have a pen?Mista: A pen?! Y-Yeah, I have one...Crunch,Sfx: s*abMista: Looks like he's breathing.Gio: I'll give life to this pen to create parts for his tongue.Gio: That way, he can breathe while I create his tongue.Squalo: I see...Squalo: So that's Giorno Giovanna.Tiziano: Now I'm starting to understand the information the boss gave us.Tiziano: We're going to have to be the most careful around that newbie kid.Squalo: Yeah... I'm a bit surprised he saved Narancia.Squalo: I thought my Crush would be enough for this job,Squalo: but apparently, I'm going to need your help eliminating all five of them,Squalo: Tiziano.Tiziano: As the boss's elite guards, we're going to have to defeat him here.Tiziano: Are you ready, Squalo?Squalo: All according to plan.Squalo: As long as we can lure them to water, Crush is invincible.Squalo: Our plan will decide everything.Squalo: We'll take care of them one at a time, Tiziano.Tiziano: Yeah, Squalo...Tiziano: We'll use Narancia.Sign: CrushSign: SqualoBruno: Are you all right, Narancia?Nara: Yeah...Nara: You guys saved me.Bruno: What did you see?Bruno: How did the enemy Stand att*ck?Nara: It... c-came from the soup...Gio: Narancia, don't force it.Nara: I-I'm fine. I can talk.Mista: Hey, Narancia, what's the enemy like?Mista: Where'd he run off to?Nara: He was...Nara: He was like a pebble!Nara: He was huge, and he ran into the restaurant!Mista: Huh? Huge like a pebble?Mista: But earlier, you were saying it was in your soup!Mista: You're contradicting yourself.Nara: Huh? Did I just say that?Mista: So, then... is the enemy about this big?Nara: Nope.Nara: Huh? No, wait!Mista: Then, like, this big?Nara: U-Um...Mista: No? Then, like, this big?Nara: Yup, exactly.Mista: So something this big was in your soup,Mista: and it went running into the restaurant?Nara: Yup.Nara: Huh?

It was slow!Bruno: What?Mista: Huh?!Mista: If it was huge and slow, why didn't we see it?Mista: Did you actually see a Stand?Nara: Of course I did... n—Mista: You keep contradicting yourself!Mista: You're not trying to act tough because the enemy got you, are you?Nara: I...

Let's use the channel!Gio: Yes, Narancia. That's what I just...Gio: Narancia?Mista: Narancia, why do you keep covering your mouth?Mista: Let me see it.Mista: What the hell? It's completely normal.Nara: Yup! I'm totally fine!Nara: There's no problem at all, Mista!Abba: So, what are we going to do, Bucciarati?Abba: Are we going out to sea?Bruno: No. Let's not follow the channel just yet.Bruno: This is our chance.Bruno: We're going to use it to defeat that enemy!Bruno: The boss wasn't expecting our betrayal,Bruno: which means there probably aren't that many members of his elite guard here.Bruno: If we defeat him now,Bruno: I'm sure we'll be able to get through the seas of Venice just fine.Mista: I see. You have a point. I agree.Abba: Yeah, I agree.Gio: Very well, Bucciarati.Gio: If you say so.Bruno: Abbacchio, could you use your Moody Jazz to replay what happened?Abba: Yeah, sure.Abba: Where do you want to start?Abba: From when the soup was still on the table?Bruno: Yeah.Abba: What the hell, Narancia?Nara: Guys! The enemy's right over there!Abba: Over there? You mean inside the restaurant's bathroom?Mista: Narancia, you damn well better have seen something this time!Nara: Yup, I did!Bruno: After them.

Does that have anything to do with it?Nara: Great job, Giorno! You're so intuitive.Nara: Just a little more...Nara: Just a little more, and Giorno will figure it out.Gio: But you're bleeding really badly.Gio: First, let's take care of that wound.Gio: Now, let me see it.Nara: No!

I got him out of the sewers!Abba: It's no use, Bucciarati.Abba: I can't replay this enemy any further.Abba: I know for sure that they were in this cup on top of this table.Abba: But they were only there for a moment.Abba: From there, Moody Jazz can't transform, nor go forward.Bruno: What do you mean, Abbacchio?Abba: I don't know. Maybe they can teleport.Abba: But I don't have the answer.Abba: The replay for this enemy...Abba: It won't go any further, like a video tape that's been torn.Squalo: I can't believe Narancia would go this far...Tizi: No, it's Giorno.Tizi: This all happened because Giorno intentionally got sh*tTizi: by Li'l Bomber's g*ns.Squalo: sh*t! I can't get rid of the residue!Squalo: Even in the water!Squalo: Because the b*ll*ts were from a Stand.Squalo: I have to disappear somehow.Squalo: Somewhere he can't detect me!Nara: I've been watching...Nara: and this shark bastard is pretty damn fast for a remote-controlled Stand,Nara: but it looks like it can't get very far in a single leap.Nara: Looks to be about two to three meters!Squalo: sh*t!Squalo: H-His att*cks are becoming more precise!Nara: It could be due to injuries, but their speed's getting slower!Tizi: Squalo!Nara: Yes! Now I just need to end this with a finishing blow!Nara: Take this, you fishy bastard!Nara: Th-This smell...Nara: There's a gas leak!Squalo: This is all according to plan, Narancia.Squalo: Because you sh*t,Squalo: hot water spilled from the potand extinguished the burner.Squalo: Now Li'l Bomber won't be able to sh**t its g*ns!Squalo: Now you can't track me!Squalo: If one of the sparks from your g*n happens to ignite the gas,Squalo: you may survive, but everything around there will burn,Squalo: filling the room with carbon dioxide, and you won't be able to find me anymore!Squalo: Narancia, just go ahead and try to sh**tSqualo: those g*ns!Squalo: We've won!Nara: You know, if I can't sh**t...Nara: I have other ways of k*lling you!Nara: Yes! I got the enemy!Nara: Bucciarati! Mista! The enemy's here!Nara: Abbacchio, the enemy's able to move from liquid to liquid!Nara: Giorno's breathing again!Nara: Huh?Nara: Wait. What did I just say?Nara: Why was I able to speak the truth?Tizi: Squalo, I've released Talking Mouth from Narancia's tongue,Tizi: just like you planned.Tizi: You're pretty badly injured, but I'm sure the boss will be satisfied.Mista: Did you just yell something, Narancia?!Abba: Did you say the enemy's over here?Tizi: But the release of Talking Mouth is only temporary.Mista: Giorno's... That must be the enemy!Nara: Wh-What?!Nara: W-Wai—Tizi: We win, Squalo.Tizi: Yes... This is all according to plan!Mista: Here we go, Six b*ll*ts!Nara: sh**t, Mista!Mista: Wh-What?!Nara: Sh-sh*t! My radar!Nara: I can't track them! They're going to att*ck!Nara: Giorno's going to be taken because of my lie!Gio: N-Narancia!Gio: L-Look for it!Nara: G-Giorno!Gio: Don't go after the Stand...Gio: Go after the user!Nara: Giorno!Mista: Hey, Narancia!Mista: You bastard! Why'd you tell me to sh**t?!Mista: This room was filled with gas!Nara: Look out! It's the enemy! The enemy's above!Nara: No! Below! The enemy's below!Mista: What?!Nara: Guys!Nara: It's no use! I can't stop myself from talking!Nara: I have to stop talking!Nara: It disappeared!Nara: They're planning to eliminate Giorno before anyone else!Gio: Don't go after the Stand...Gio: Go after the user!Nara: Giorno!Nara: Giorno told me to find the user.Nara: Right... They're hurt.Nara: Because they're hurt, their breathing is probably labored.Nara: So that's what he means.Nara: He wants me to use my radar to find them.Nara: I'm alone in this. I have to do this alone.Nara: Someone who's breathing hard...Nara: They have a remote-controlled Stand,Nara: but they have to be somewhere around here.Nara: There's no time! I have to be quick and find them!Sign: Talking MouthSign: TizianoTizi: Okay, this is all according to plan.Tizi: With Giorno gone, there's no one to fix their injuries.Tizi: Now, finish off Giorno.Tizi: For good.Squalo: Yeah, I'll do it.Squalo: I've been injured,Squalo: but I have plenty of strength left to att*ck him.Squalo: Hey, look. It's Narancia.Squalo: What's he doing out here?Tizi: Where is Crush right now?Squalo: Over there.Squalo: It exited the restaurant's sewer pipe and is heading down the canal.Squalo: He shouldn't be able to track it anymore...Squalo: Don't tell me he's trying to find me instead!Squalo: My breathing...Tizi: Calm down, Squalo.Tizi: That's impossible.Tizi: He's just struggling because he's run out of options.Tizi: How many people do you think there are within hundred meters of here?Tizi: Fifty? A hundred?Tizi: There's no way he could tell you apart from the others.Squalo: But I'm injured.Squalo: If he's trying to find someone with labored breathing...Tizi: Don't panic, Squalo.Tizi: Look at the bottom of the stairs.Tizi: There are many with even more labored breathing than you in that square.Tizi: Calm yourself and your breathing.Tizi: If we hide your injuries and head into the square like nothing's wrong, we'll be safe.Tizi: We still win!Squalo: Yeah, you're right... You're exactly right.Squalo: There's no way he'd find us.Nara: I found you!Nara: You're right there!Squalo: Wh-What?!Squalo: sh*t! I have to retrieve Crush!Tizi: Calm down, Squalo! Think this through!Tizi: He can only say the opposite of what he's thinking right now.Tizi: He said he found us, meaning he hasn't found us!Tizi: Don't forget that!Squalo: Then why did he bother saying that?!Tizi: He wants you to panic and make your breathing even more labored!Tizi: Please calm down. If you panic, it's exactly what he wants.Tizi: There's no way Narancia can single you out.Tizi: This is just his futile, last-ditch attempt.Tizi: Calm your breathing.Nara: I found you...Nara: There you are.Nara: I finally... found you.Squalo: He said it again!Tizi: Please, calm down.Tizi: He hasn't found us. That's fact.Tizi: He's definitely lying!Tizi: My Talking Mouth is still definitely on his tongue...Squalo: H-Hey, look!Tizi: Wh-What?!Squalo: He cut out his own tongue!Squalo: With his own Kn*fe!Tizi: That's impossible!Tizi: No one can survive after cutting out their own tongue,Tizi: let alone speak!Nara: I found... you!Tizi: H-He has another tongue!Tizi: The ladybug became a tongue!Tizi: It can't be!Squalo: It's Giorno!Squalo: Giorno Giovanna!Squalo: Just as the boss had said, he's the biggest problem!Squalo: That bastard Giorno must've created a tongueSqualo: for Narancia in the kitchen and given it to him!Squalo: He's coming! He's heading this way!Squalo: So he was tracking my breathing!Tizi: It's the opposite!Tizi: If he was actually tracking you, he would've att*cked already!Nara: Considering the number of people out here, there's all kinds of breathing.Nara: Labored breathing, slow breathing...Nara: There's so much that I can't single anyone out.Nara: But I've been waiting...Nara: I've been waiting for this...Nara: For the moment when someone's breathing drastically changes suddenly!Nara: For someone to change their breathing drasticallyNara: after seeing me cut my tongue out with a Kn*fe!Nara: For someone to see their Stand hanging out along with my tongueNara: and panic bigtime!Nara: That's what I've been waiting for!Nara: Just when I thought I'd lost you guys and was about to give up!Nara: You, over there!Nara: Your breathing just fluctuated, didn't it?!Nara: Yeah, you! I'm talking to you!Nara: I'm talking to you, long hair!Tizi: This can't be!Tizi: He actually cut out his tongue to track me!Nara: Which must mean the shark user is the dude next to you!Nara: He seems pretty damn pale.Tizi: Squalo, retrieve Crush!Squalo: I'm already on it!Squalo: It's traveling through the sewers and heading toward that well.Squalo: But... there's no water here!Squalo: There's no liquid that Crush can jump at Narancia from!Nara: You must be him!Nara: The guy who dragged Giorno away!Squalo: Tiziano!Tizi: Now you have some liquid... Squalo.Tizi: This didn't... go exactly according to plan...Tizi: But this doesn't change our victory.Tizi: We're still going to... win...Squalo: I don't give a damn about the boss's orders anymore.Squalo: I'm not going to k*ll you because I was ordered to as one of the elite guard.Squalo: Tiziano... I'm going to eliminate him for you!Squalo: I'll k*ll all of Narancia's friends, too!Squalo: I'll rip them to pieces and make them pay!Squalo: I'll make them all pay!Squalo: Crush! Rip out his throat!Nara: Do you think... I'm going to falter?Nara: Because of... Because of something like this?Nara: We're...Nara: going to get the hell out of Venice,Nara: completely safe and sound.Nara: See ya...Nara: Volare via.Rome___a_m_,Nara: "Go flying"Squalo: You're a damn traitor...Squalo: You're supposed to be eliminated by the boss...Squalo: You're supposed to have no choice but to fear your future...Squalo: What in the world is driving them forward?Squalo: Why does it seem like they have hope?Squalo: Wh-What could it...Guy: Someone just collapsed!Nara: Giorno!Nara: Y-Yes! He's breathing again, faintly!Nara: Giorno, wake up! Giorno! Giorno!Giorno: Narancia...Nara: Abbacchio doesn't think too highly of you,Nara: but we all end up moving under your direction,Nara: as though you're leading us...Nara: We might actually have some hope for this journey... with you around.Nara: Giorno, let's get back to everyone else.Bruno: How long has it been since the att*ck began?Bruno: Four to five minutes?Bruno: Anyway, it's hard to imagine that another assassinBruno: from the organization is in Venice right now.Bruno: It should be wide open.Bruno: Let's head toward the airport!Bruno: We'll get a plane!Bruno: We're going to get a plane and head to Sardinia, no matter what.Bruno: We must find out about the boss's past as quickly as possible...Bruno: or we lose.

You're going by what was in a movie?Bruno: Abbacchio, how long until takeoff?Abba: No idea. I can't exactly fast forward this.Abba: It'll probably take around ten minutes.Trish: Bucciarati's leg... Was it injured in the restaurant battle?Trish: Still, despite how deep that cut looks, he's barely bleeding.Nara: Up front, to the left! Something's coming!Nara: Something's heading our way, Mista!Mista: Stop right there!Mista: Just so you know,JoJo-main: ,anyone who gets near this plane will be sh*t dead, even if they're a saint!Mista: And it's not like a saint would even come here.Mista: If you care about your well-being at all,JoJo-main: ,you'll turn your back to this plane and get the hell off this runway!Mista: Apparently your ears are plugged up with wax, but do your best to listen.Mista: I'll warn you one last time.Mista: I'll let you go, so get the hell off this runway.Nara: He's a Stand user!Mista: Six b*ll*ts!Mista: Giorno! Narancia! Be careful of the enemy!Nara: His signal disappeared.Nara: He's the only enemy in the area.Nara: No one else is trying to get near this plane.Mista: Giorno! As you can see, he d*ed instantly.Mista: There's no need to check up on him.Gio: Yes, I know, but we need to be cautious.Gio: He went down surprisingly easily.Gio: It's like he showed up only to be defeated.Mista: Hey, are you mocking me and my b*ll*ts?Mista: It just means that he was no match for me!Mista: He's obviously way weaker!b*ll*ts: Yeah! Yeah!Gio: He's completely dead.Gio: Not only is he not breathing, but his heartbeat and life energy are gone, too.Nara: Mista! Giorno! We're taking off! Hurry up and get on!Mista: Come on, Giorno. Let's go.Trish: I wonder if my father...JoJo-main: ,No, your bossTrish: might have guessed that I'd go to Sardinia to find out about the past.Bruno: Former.Bruno: Our former boss.Bruno: I'm sure the thought crossed his mind.Bruno: That's why we need to find out about the boss's past as soon as possible.Bruno: I figure that when he met your mother in Sardinia,Bruno: he wasn't a gangster who needed to hide his identity yet.JoJo-main: ,He was just an ordinary young man.Bruno: He became a gangster after that.Bruno: He must have some kind of identity.Bruno: The true identity of the boss from fifteen years ago surely exists.Bruno: As his daughter, you should be able to track it down.Bruno: Something, anything...JoJo-main: ,Do you remember anything more detailed from your mother's stories of the past?Trish: Cala di Volpe.Bruno: Cala di Volpe... The fox's tail?Trish: It's a resort located in a beautiful, emerald green coastal area.Trish: My mother mentioned that she met my father there while on vacation.Trish: She also mentioned that my father grew up in Sardinia.Trish: Apparently, he spoke with a Sardinian dialect.Trish: But then he disappeared, and my mother never found out more than that...JoJo-main: ,Not even his name.Trish: I'm not even sure what I should look for.Trish: Besides, this is all just from my mother's reminiscing.Bruno: You're the boss's only living relative.Bruno: That's why he's trying to eliminate you.Bruno: Cala di Volpe...Bruno: That means we have our destination.Gio: Mista.Gio: Get your g*n out and take aim.Gio: Listen to this sound...mista: Sound? You mean the sound of the engine?mista: What are you talking about?Gio: Just please, get your g*n out. There's something weird about this cabinet.Mista: Hey, hey, hey, hey...Mista: The only one being weird is you.Mista: You're the one who said there wasn't so much as a cockroach on this plane.Gio: That's true... I don't feel any life energy, even now.Gio: But...Mista: But what?JoJo-main: ,Are you trying to say there's a remote-controlled Stand on the plane?Mista: You sure you're not just freaking out?Gio: I could very well just be freaking out.Gio: But I know I heard something.Gio: I have a bad feeling about this.Gio: I'm going to open this. Please have your g*n ready.Gio: A freezer...JoJo-main: ,I-I apologize. I was getting a little too high-strung.Mista: Giorno, what the hell kind of joke is this?JoJo-main: ,When did you put that in there?Mista: You're trying to scare me with chicken scraps?JoJo-main: ,What the hell's so funny about that?Mista: Th-That's not chicken.JoJo-main: ,It's still wet. Th-The blood's still fresh.Mista: Aren't these the fingers of the fatty I blasted back at the airport?Mista: Giorno, am I wrong?Gio: Calm down, Mista.Mista: Hey... Is there another one now?Bruno: You two. Is something wrong?Bruno: Giorno, you confirmed that there weren't any signs of life on this plane.Bruno: But Mista is saying that it looked like those fingers increased from three to four.Bruno: Is there any life energy in those fingers?Gio: They are just bones. They have no life.Gio: If these bones had any signs of life or were a Stand,JoJo-main: ,plant life from Golden Wind's powers wouldn't grow from them.mista: It freaked me out because it looked like there was one more,JoJo-main: ,so I could've just been seeing things...mista: But there's still something really off about this!Bruno: Indeed.Bruno: I'm not sure how or why, but someone put these in here on purpose.Bruno: Let's throw these outside.Nara: Huh?! But opening the door is super dangerous!Nara: Apparently, the difference in air pressure would send us flying like some rat in a toilet!Bruno: Everyone, hang on to something.Bruno: Zipper Man!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HFFB&\c&H&\shad}PopBruno: Guess you didn't need to hang on after all.Bruno: Anything else out of the ordinary?Bruno: Check every inch of this plane.Gio: I want some pizza, too.Gio: I want to go back to Naples and enjoy a simple Margherita...Gio: This jet looks like a train station bathroom.Gio: But it must be some rich guy's jet...Gio: What the hell is this?Gio: The enemy Stand's name is...Gio: Notorious Chase.Gio: Who wrote all this, and when?Gio: Who the hell wrote this?!Gio: What?!Gio: Th-These fingers...Gio: I-It can't be! We threw the finger bones outside!Gio: We didn't even touch them!Gio: Is this what made that graffiti?Gio: A corpse?Gio: B-But this can't be... The Stand ability of someone who's dead?Gio: Is this thing getting bigger by consuming my body?Gio: Golden Wind!Gio: Cut off my right arm!Gio: What?!Gio: It's consuming my arm in the same shape.Gio: My Stand... is being consumed!GIO: The one who was scribbling on the wall was me...Gio: The one who brought the fingers onto the plane... was me!Bruno: What's going on, Giorno?Mista: H-Hey...Gio: Golden Wind!Mista: You should probably make a new right arm fast, Giorno.Gio: Was he trying to jump onto Golden Wind's right arm just now?Bruno: What's going on, Giorno? This is unthinkable!Gio: We've never dealt with a Stand like this before.JoJo-main: ,It goes against all we know.Bruno: A Stand... Does that mean the user is hiding somewhere?Gio: The user isn't here.Gio: He's already dead. He d*ed on the runway.Gio: That man came here specifically to die...JoJo-main: ,so that his Stand could automatically trace us.Gio: Its energy is still alive.JoJo-main: ,It appears to be a Stand that only activates when its user has d*ed.Gio: There's no user, so it can keep up with this jet's speed.Nara: But it's super slow, Giorno.Nara: Actually, it's not moving at all. Did it die?mista: It's not moving?JoJo-main: ,No, Narancia...mista: It's eating, so it doesn't have to move right now.mista: I got too close. This thing is fast.Mista: My b*ll*ts...Mista: It got four of them just now... That's more than half.b*ll*ts: Number Two! Three! Six! Seven!Mista: This thing's seriously bad news!Mista: Don't get too close.Mista: Everyone, stay back.Nara: Mista!Bruno: sh*t! Don't get close to it!Gio: For some reason, it changed its target to Narancia.Gio: It's using some criteria to decide who to att*ck.Nara: How dare you underestimate me?!Nara: I just need to stay away from it, right?Nara: But...JoJo-main: ,My L'il Bomber can blow this thing apart without getting close at all!Gio: That movement... It's definitely tracking something.Nara: I-Impossible! It's fast! It's way too fast!Nara: This isn't good! At this rate, it's going to att*ck all of us!Bruno: N-Narancia!Bruno: Trish! Hide inside the closet!Bruno: What?!Runo: Why is it going after Trish?!Bruno: Hurry up and shut the door!Trish: I-I won't make it in time!Bruno: Trish!Gio: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!Gio: I figured out...JoJo-main: ,what it's tracking.Gio: It's movement!JoJo-main: ,This Stand reacts to movement and prioritizes attacking whatever moves!Gio: It matches the speed of the fastest target and prioritizes it.Gio: If we can get this thing off the plane along with my left arm,Gio: we'll get to Sardinia safely.Gio: Then everything will go as planned.Bruno: Giorno, wait!JoJo-main: ,Who's going to heal your wounds if you lose both your arms?Bruno: Swap with me! Get that Stand onto me!Gio: We won't make it in time, Bucciarati!Gio: It's climbing up higher!Bruno: D-Don't!Bruno: Giorno!Bruno: How can this be?JoJo-main: ,We haven't even gotten to Sardinia yet,b*llet: Mista!Bruno: and both Mista and Narancia are...Bruno: How can this be?Bruno: If we weren't in an enclosed space like this,JoJo-main: ,they might not have been so badly injured.Bruno: My idea to board a plane was naïve...Trish: No one could've predicted this.Trish: And it's because we're on a planeJoJo-main: ,that we were able to blow that Stand away.Bruno: Regardless, we have to tend to their wounds.Bruno: They're all gravely injured.JoJo-main: ,Let's get them inside the turtle.Trish: Hang on a second.Trish: Tend to their wounds... Their wounds...Trish: Giorno's arms...JoJo-main: ,They can be healed, right?Trish: With Golden Wind's powers...Bruno: Golden Wind and Zipper Man's powers activate once their fists hit or touch something.Bruno: This is the most damage we've endured so far.Bruno: Giorno Giovanna is no longer able to fight.Bruno: That probably goes for Mista and Narancia, as well.Bruno: Giorno can't recreate the arms that he's lost!Bruno: Trish, you should get some rest.Bruno: I'm going to go tell Abbacchio.Trish: I'm...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,heading to Sardinia for myself.Trish: Just for my own safety...Trish: And...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,For my future, I want to find the key to my father.Trish: But Giorno and the others are different.Trish: They're making decisions based onJoJo-internal/narrator: ,what they think is right, not for their future or safety.Trish: I...JoJo-main: ,can't even begin to understand that.Trish: Was that... a ball?Trish: A ball was rolling around?Trish: I-Impossible!Tirsh: It didn't get blown away by the plane's speed?Trish: No, it's the opposite...Trish: Giorno...Gio: It's movement!JoJo-flashback: ,This Stand reacts to movement and prioritizes attacking whatever moves!Trish: In that case, the plane is moving through the sky...Trish: The faster something is, the more it prioritizes catching it!Trish: It att*cked the Kn*fe just now because I dropped it...Trish: I want to run into the closet and shut the door.Trish: Slowly...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I have to move slowly...Trish: I have to escape without any sudden movement.Trish: I-It's so sensitive!Trish: Why did it change direction?Trish: It must've reacted to something.Trish: That's... Giorno's brooch?Trish: Could that brooch be...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,alive?Trish: Golden Wind... No, Giorno's arms...Tirsh: H-His left hand?Trish: C-Could it be forming his left hand?Trish: Before Giorno cut off his arm, he used Golden Wind to give the ladybug lifeTrish: and created the hand he lost.Trish: Giorno's not out of the game yet!Trish: If I can protect that left hand,Trish: Narancia and Mista's wounds can also be healed!Trish: B-But how am I going to do that?!

Was that—Spice: What's important right now, Trish,Spice: is that you picked up the brooch.JoJo-main: ,Your strong determination overpowered any hesitation.Spice: You are becoming stronger, both mentally and as a person.Spice: And you are able to make anything in this world softer, more elastic.Spice: Making things softer...Spice: means they become harder to break than diamonds!Trish: I-It's coming again!Spice: This time, stay still.Trish: I'm starting to understand that you're me, but I have to hide!Trish: Make the closet door soft!Trish: Please make it in time!Trish: Damn it!

No one can defeat this thing!Spice: Trish, I asked you not to move.Spice: We have to head to the cockpit, where Bucciarati is,JoJo-main: ,but we went in the opposite direction.Trish: What are you talking about?JoJo-main: ,Giorno's brooch is developing into his left hand and moving.Trish: I had to run away!Trish: But your ability...JoJo-main: ,All it does is make things softer!JoJo-main: ,It's taking all I have to evade these att*cks!Trish: I-It's going to get me!Trish: I-It att*cked the clock again?Trish: What?Spice: I made the clock more elastic.Spice: As long as you don't move faster than the second hand on that clock,Spice: it'll continue to respond to the second handJoJo-main: ,and give priority to attacking the clock over and over.Spice: When I said not to move, I just meant to move slowly.Spice: Move slowly.Spice: Slower than the second hand.Spice: At super slow speed...Spice: But with the strength of a vise.Spice: We're going to rip this thing apart...Spice: and k*ll it.Spice: You bastard! Just go to hell already!Spice: You piece of sh*t! Quit latching on to this world, damn it!Trish: It's falling apart into tiny pieces and disintegrating!Trish: This Stand that just kept pursuing its targets, like a vengeful spirit,Trish: is becoming so small and disappearing...Trish: Y-Your name...Trish: Do you have a name?Trish: What should I call you?Spice: Spicy Lady.Trish: I see...JoJo-main: ,That's a fitting name.Sign: Trish UnaSign: Spicy LadySpice: Now Mista and Narancia's wounds can be healed.Spice: But Giorno Giovanna... He is a strange person.Spice: Not only is he able to give things life,Spice: but his actions also helped you mature.Bruno: I'm going to go make sure the engines are okay.Trish: Bucciarati, I have some news to break to you...Trish: The problem has already been solved. Giorno has actually already...Bruno: Don't say another word!Bruno: I-I mean... Slowly...JoJo-main: ,Come here slowly, Trish.Abba: Our altitude is , meters!Abba: ,...JoJo-main: ,,!Abba: It's no use. It just keeps falling!Abba: And I don't know why!Bruno: I figured out why we're falling, Abbacchio.Bruno: But what are we supposed to do?Bruno: What are we supposed to do about this?Trish: Bucciarati, what are you—Bruno: I told you not to move!Trish: D-Don't tell me...Abba: Th-Th-That's... But that's impossible!Bruno: Giorno said that thing has the ability to catch upJoJo-main: ,to things that move and take them in.Bruno: The engines on this plane... Just now, that thing...Bruno: Trish, don't turn around.Bruno: Don't panic, no matter what.Bruno: Slowly walk this way.Trish: Th-That's...Trish: No! Th-That's impossible!Abba: It's no use! We just keep falling!Abba: At this rate, we're going to crash!Abba: Actually, the engines are likely to explode before that!Trish: Th-That thing should've been torn into pieces and disintegrated...Trish: W-Wait, the engines are right behind the closet.Trish: Oh, no...Trish: If even a tiny part of this thing melded into the wall of the closet...Trish: There's a possibility that it took in the engine's energy.Trish: And now...Bruno: We need to make an emergency landing, Abbacchio.Bruno: The Tyrrhenian Sea is in front of us.Bruno: We need to make an emergency landing on the water.JoJo-main: ,It's the only choice we have!Bruno: An emergency landing?JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Even if we're able to land safely, what are we supposed to do after that?Bruno: This thing will still come after us!Bruno: It's invincible. It's too powerful.Bruno: It's an invincible ability!Bruno: Now, slowly, Trish...Bruno: Slowly, like a slug. Don't panic.Bruno: Don't run, whatever you do!Bruno: If you rush, it'll att*ck you!Bruno: Wh-What the?!JoJo-main: ,What are you doing?! It's going to catch up to you!Trish: Yes, it certainly will!Trish: If I do something as lame as moving slow, it's going to catch up to me anyway!Trish: Get in the cockpit, Bucciarati!Bruno: Have you lost your mind, Trish?!JoJo-main: ,It's going to destroy the door!Abba: Th-The door...Bruno: Th-This is...Abba: What the... Don't tell me you...Trish: An emergency landing?JoJo-main: ,Bucciarati, we need to do the opposite.Trish: If we all want to survive and get to Sardinia safely,Trish: we need to... destroy this plane!Spicy: Wannabe!Trish: Spicy Lady!Bruno: T-Trish... This is... When did you obtain Stand abilities?Abba: Th-The walls and glass are all soft like rubber.Trish: If that thing is going to prioritize speed in its att*cks,Trish: then crashing would be faster.Trish: A plane crashing is way fasterTrish: than this parachute!Trish: Yes! You stupid bastard!Abba: We took pretty severe damage,JoJo-main: ,but now that the plane has crashed into the waters near Sardinia,Abba: that means the boss's men can't confirm whether we're dead or alive.Abba: Right?Abba: The organization's lost track of us.Abba: That means we've got some time now.Abba: Time to track down the boss's true identity and find him!Bruno: No, Abbacchio.Bruno: It appears that our damage is going to grow just a bit... just a little bit more.Bruno: I'll get rid of that thing.JoJo-main: ,I have to use my zipper.Abba: Wh-What?!Abba: Don't tell me...Bruno: It's completely invincible.Bruno: There's no way to k*ll this thing.Bruno: We can only chase it out with speed, just like Giorno did.Abba: B-Bucciarati, you can't mean... D-Don't do it!Abba: You're going to wrap that thing onto your arm?!Abba: Don't! Are you going to take yourself out of this, too?!Trish: No, Abbacchio.JoJo-main: ,No one else is going to get hurt.Trish: Giorno's Golden Wind abilityTrish: is safe right here.Abba: Wh-When did you...Trish: Arrivederci.Sign: "Goodbye."Nar: Stand name: Notorious Chase.Nar: Complete annihilation: impossible.Nar: Forced to track the crashing waves of the sea forever.Nar: At times, it att*cks ships that happen to move faster than the waves and sinks them.Nar: Eventually, these waters would be known to local fishermen as the "Tyrrhenian Belly"Nar: and considered ominous.Trish: Now, let's lay low and find out who the boss really is.Trish: We're going to track down my father's past!Nar: The private jet h*jacked from the Marco Polo International AirportNar: crash-landed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, fifty kilometers northeast of Sardinia.Nar: This mystery has yet to be solved.Nar: No passengers were found on board.Diavolo: I thought I'd made it disappear,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,but one's past wraps itself around one's true peace, never letting go.Diavolo: Unbelievable. This is why blood relations are so troublesome.Diavolo: It wouldn't be concerning if it involved a stranger,Diavolo: but once blood relations are involved, things become tricky.Diavolo: But that's all it is.Diavolo: It's just a blood relation. If I can get rid of that,Diavolo: I'll be able to remain in the prime of my life.Diavolo: Several days ago, after Pericolo secured Trish,Diavolo: the traitors who were after her scoured this apartment that Trish and her mother lived in,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,but none of them noticed.Diavolo: Every morning of her life,Trish awoke in this house...Diavolo: And...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Every day, she looked at this picture that her mother had lovingly put up.Diavolo: But this date... There's no doubt about it.Diavolo: It's fifteen years ago.Diavolo: This portrait... Even I almost missed it.Diavolo: To think that such a thing existed...Diavolo: Their plane crashed... but they're alive.Diavolo: I can feel it...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,My daughter's Stand abilities have awakened.Diavolo: I can also tell that she's alive and heading to Sardinia.Diavolo: And if it was Abbacchio's Moody Jazz that was flying the plane,Diavolo: that means he's also alive, at the very least.Diavolo: I can't let Moody Jazz go to the spot in this picture.Diavolo: Trish might not realize it right now, but she'll surely rememberDiavolo: the existence of this picture.Diavolo: And if she goes to Sardinia, she'll figure outDiavolo: that the person who took this portrait of her mother when she was youngDiavolo: was me!Diavolo: I can't let Moody Jazz's ability replay that!Diavolo: I'll have to go there myself.Diavolo: I have to do it myself.Diavolo: I can't let any of my subordinates attempt to handle this.Lady: Oh, y-you were home.Lady: I knocked, but... I'm here to clean your room.Lady: P-Pardon me, I'll come back later...Lady: Huh?Lady: Huh?JoJo-main: ,Why was I here again?Lady: O-Oh, right! To clean! I'm supposed to clean!Lady: Now, time to get to work.

I'm very sorry, Boss.JoJo-main: ,Yes, I'm about to start watching the building.Diavolo: You're about to watch the building?Diavolo: No, my Doppio.Diavolo: Take a good look. Slowly...

The traitor assassin!Doppio: He appeared just like the fortuneteller said!Diavolo: Apparently, due to the plane crash,JoJo-main: ,he came to notice the existence of this photo of Sardinia that was at Trish's house.Diavolo: We need to take care of him first.JoJo-main: ,Otherwise, he'll interfere once Trish arrives.Diavolo: I'll be the one to finish him off.Diavolo: We need to get close to him without him figuring out my true identity.Diavolo: Risotto's ability is a mystery to me, as well.Diavolo: Draw him out about two meters away from you.Diavolo: Then he'll definitely be within Emperor Crimson's range.Diavolo: You can do it.JoJo-main: ,I'm hanging up, my Doppio.Doppio: Yes, I understand, Boss.JoJo-main: ,Beep.Doppio: What's this? My head... It hurts.Doppio: O-Oh, yeah. I don't have time to worry about a headache.Doppio: I just had a call from the boss.Doppio: My mission is to keep an eye on that building and... uh...Doppio: What was it again?Doppio: Get closer?JoJo-main: ,Right! I have to get closer!Doppio: But to what?Risotto: I won't get closer to you.Risotto: Look over here.Doppio: Wh-What the?!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,But I think I've seen him before...Doppio: Wh-Who is he again?Risotto: Move your hand.Risotto: Otherwise, I can't see your face.Doppio: I-I don't have any money!Doppio: B-Blood!JoJo-main: ,Why does this always happen to me?!Risotto: Maybe I just imagined it.JoJo-main: ,The ignorance and fear in his expression are not an act.Risotto: If he was from Passione, he wouldn't act like this.Risotto: Not to mention, he's more unguarded than a baby.Risotto: He must be a civilian.Doppio: Please don't!Risotto: Stop fussing. I'm just going to pick up my Kn*fe.Risotto: I don't care about you anymore.Doppio: I-I don't feel so good... My head hurts...Doppio: T-Two meters...Risotto: That's right.JoJo-main: ,There was just one thing you did that seemed like an act.Risotto: When you fell,JoJo-main: ,you reflexively hid the envelope so I wouldn't see it, didn't you?Risotto: It's right under your left shoe.Risotto: What are you hiding?JoJo-main: ,If I'm satisfied with what I see, I'll leave.Doppio: What is your deal?!JoJo-main: ,I-I don't have any money! Just let me go!Risotto: It wasn't murderous intent or hostility, but your expression there seemed fake.Risotto: Stand up, move your left leg, and show me.Risotto: I told you to stand up! Stand up!Risotto: Oh, so it's just an envelope.Risotto: There's nothing in it.Risotto: Your trembling certainly isn't an act,JoJo-main: ,and I can tell you're a coward who can't lie.Risotto: But now... I'm even more interested in you.Risotto: You're definitely a Stand user.Risotto: You heard that sound, too, didn't you?Risotto: Just now, you glanced over toward that sound.Risotto: That's the sound of scouting.Risotto: It's carefully scouting the area.Risotto: That sound and shape...Risotto: is Li'l Bomber!Risotto: They've finally made it here!Risotto: And who are you to show up to such an important location?Risotto: It must mean that the boss trusts you greatly.Risotto: But there is true fear in your heart.Risotto: You're a walking contradiction!Doppio: Shut your trap!JoJo-main: ,You're the one who's about to be shaking in your boots!Risotto: I see.JoJo-main: ,Since you're running toward me, you must be a close-ranged power type.Risotto: Your range is around two to three meters.Risotto: As long as I know that, I know how I'll k*ll you.Doppio: What... the...

Their physique can change, as well as their way of speaking.Riso: I had just thought that you were the boss's most trusted subordinate.Riso: But you...JoJo-main: ,To think that you...Riso: I can't wait.JoJo-main: ,I can't what to see what your face will look like once you die!Riso: There's nothing else you can do.Riso: I'm keeping my distance.JoJo-main: ,You have no strength to resist.Riso: There's nothing you can do!Riso: I've won!JoJo-main: ,I'm going to chop off your head!Riso: This is the end!

I was the one who went down into the boat.Nara: It's good that we made it out alive, but because of me, we almost d*ed.Nara: Besides, if Bucciarati hadn't told me to throw the turtle,JoJo-main: ,I might've dropped it into the ocean.Trish: I know that!Trish: What I'm saying is that he's cold to everyone!Nara: Say... I don't really understand how girls feel, but...Nara: Were you hoping he would ask you if you were okay?Nara: I already know how Bucciarati is,Nara: but you're dying to know more about him.Trish: Excuse me? I'm dying to what?Nara: Well, getting to Rome is what's most important right now.Nara: You can figure out your feelings later.Nara: I'm really not doing so great right now.Nara: Let me rest for a bit.Mista: The only way we can go is up right now,JoJo-main: ,but if we should ever have to go down any lower than where we are...Bruno: We'll be fine.JoJo-main: ,This village is built on the side of a mountain.Bruno: All the roads are uphill.Bruno: And outside the village, there are cars still running.Bruno: That means the mold's range hasn't expanded yet.Bruno: We just need to acquire a car and get out of this village quickly.Bruno: We need to hurry to Rome at all costs.Mista: Which car should we take?Bruno: One with a corpse next to it, because that corpse should have the key to that car.Bruno: It was just the mold breaking that corpse's hand apart.Bruno: I'll watch our rear.JoJo-main: ,You hurry up and get a car.Mista: Right.Bruno: Mista, I take that back.JoJo-main: ,Something...

You feel blessed.Cio: When your plant grabbed on to this helicopter,JoJo-main: ,I actually panicked because I thought I was in danger.Cio: I was in utter despair.Cio: But I got through it.Cio: I was able to turn that despair around with my experience and mental strength.Cio: And that makes me feel truly blessed right now.Gio: Golden Wi—Cio: Don't you dare climb up here!Five: Giorno!Cio: Did you forget that both of my legs were still hiding?!Cio: And the second situation that makes one feel blessed...Cio: is when you look down upon someone who's in utter despair!Cio: I've won!Cio: By the time you hit the ground,Cio: the mold will tear your body to shreds!Five: Giorno, take this!Five: Jump in there, Giorno!Five: Hurry and return to the helicopter!Gio: Grazie, Number Five!Five: Pound him!Cio: How pitiful.Cio: Nothing's changed, Giorno Giovanna.Cio: I, Cioccolata, am still going to win!Cio: The branch you just grew is also living.Cio: Meaning if it drops even a few centimeters,Cio: mold will att*ck that branch!Five: Jump onto the helicopter, Giorno!Five: Hurry!Five: Giorno!Cio: I did it! Now, show me that expression!Cio: Show me despair!Cio: Show me, as clear as can be,JoJo-main: ,the moment you lose all hope and die!Cio: Show me your despair as you fall to your death!gio: Bene.JoJo-main: ,The angle I calculated toward the helicopter's propellers was perfect.Gio: Because it was alive, the branch was destroyed by the mold.Gio: However,Gio: the part of the branch that fell from its root no longer holds life.Gio: It's just a piece of wood.Gio: Because you destroyed it, the branch returned to being a b*llet.Gio: By the way, all that bullshit about being blessed that you were yapping about...Gio: I can't say I feel blessed at all, even though I'm looking at you.Gio: Because I've been winning against you from the start.Five: You did it! I can't believe it, Giorno!Five: That was close!JoJo-main: ,You defeated him before the mold got to the Colosseum!Five: Please take care of Mista's wounds, too, Giorno!Five: That was close! Now the rest of the b*ll*ts will be back, too.Gio: Could you move just a little to the right, Number Five?Five: Huh?Gio: I might just be worrying too much, but... What was his name? Cioccolata?Gio: He might actually be...Gio: You're just pretending to be dead, aren't you?!Gio: And you're thinking.Five: Giorno?Gio: If you can move your body just a few centimeters before I climb up there,Gio: you can slip beneath the trench and escape.Gio: You'll be able to activate the mold again,Gio: and you'll win. That's what you're thinking.Gio: To be honest, I have a hole in my right lung right now.Gio: My subclavian vein has been severed, and four of my ribs,JoJo-main: ,my right humerus, and my right hand bones have been shattered.Gio: I'm honestly not sure how fast I can get up there.Gio: But my Stand is Golden Wind.Gio: It's a power type with a range of two meters.Gio: If I just take a moment, I'll be able to end you.Five: H-He's dead! You sh*t him through the head!Gio: Good point.Gio: If you continue to stay still, I'll incapacitate you,Gio: but I promise you I won't do anything else.Gio: I'm giving you a choice.Gio: So, what are you going to do?JoJo-main: ,I'm going to start climbing now.Cio: Stay away from me!

I haven't the slightest idea...Dopp: Boss, how do you know they're here?Dopp: And if I don't turn around and look, I won't be able to tell who they are.Boss: Look at Bucciarati's eyes. That should be enough.Boss: He's reflecting in Bucciarati's eyes right now.Pol: Don't move!Pol: Stop right there.Pol: Take even a step up those stairs, and our deal is off.Dopp: You're right!

This is what you're going to say:Boss: "Do you have a problem with me being a girl?" Go on, say it, Doppio!Dopp: Do you have a problem with me being a girl?!Pol: I guess I said something I shouldn't have.JoJo-main: ,It's a bit dark in here, so I couldn't see you well.Pol: Is she a Stand user?Bruno: Of course!

There's no doubt about it.Boss: That's the arrow from back then!pol: Wh-What's this ominous murderous intent I feel?Pol: It feels like someone's pointing a Kn*fe right at my heart...Pol: I've felt something like this before...Pol: Don't tell me—Boss: No, wait... That's right. There is one person I can think of.Boss: He used the arrow to track me down...Both: He's—Boss: In Egypt, I dug up the arrows that awaken Stand abilities within people.Boss: I knew the moment I saw themJoJo-internal/narrator: ,that these arrows had some mysterious power.Boss: An old woman named Enyaba who had two right handsJoJo-internal/narrator: ,told me she'd tell me how the arrows worked in return for sh**ting some.Boss: I figured one would be more than enough,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,so I sold the other five for a handsome sum.Boss: Come to think of it, that old woman said something rather bizarre...Boss: The arrow chooses people,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,and those people are attracted to one another like magnets.Pol: In the s, me and my old friend Jotaro Kujo were investigatingJoJo-internal/narrator: ,these arrows that brought out one's Stand abilities.Pol: We heard about a young man who had dug up the other arrows,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,and we split up to be more efficient in searching for him.Pol: Jotaro went to America and Asia.Pol: I went to Europe and Africa.Pol: And I managed to find out that one of the arrows wasJoJo-internal/narrator: ,in a region of Italy where drug-related crimes had suddenly skyrocketed.Pol: I investigated an unusual region where drug crimesJoJo-internal/narrator: ,involving young people and their victims had increased twenty times,Pol: and I knew I was finally close.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,But...Boss: My organization was nearing perfection after just a few years.Boss: My subordinates swore their loyalty to me.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I had men hiding in all branches of society.Boss: I had a notion that someone was trying to track me down.Boss: In the end, I would finish them off myself.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,That's the most surefire way.Boss: I'd already decided that.Pol: But I ended up making two big mistakes.Pol: My first mistake was that this crime organization was already complete.Pol: Communications, the government, the press...Pol: Society itself had isolated me.Pol: And my second and greatest mistake...Pol: Silver Chariot!Boss: I guess I'll tell you, since you're going to die.Pol: The man who had unearthed the arrowsJoJo-internal/narrator: ,had powers far more sinister than I could have ever imagined!Boss: The moment that anyone sees Emperor Crimson...Crunch,Sfx: BoomPol: This ability...Pol: Time... It...Boss: ...they are no longer in this world.Pol: Is there no hope...?Boss: I'm certain that I k*lled him!Boss: To think that someone I had eliminatedJoJo-internal/narrator: ,in the past would show up again with an arrow!Pol: Bucciarati! The one next to you is—Pol: Wh-What? Bucciarati!Pol: Where'd the person next to you go?!Pol: They disappeared! Don't tell me...Pol: Where did they go?!Pol: Where did the one you brought here go?!Bruno: T-Trish...Pol: I'm asking you who the hell that person next to you was!Pol: I didn't hear or see anything fall, but a piece is already behind me...Pol: No... These movements...Gio: Time just skipped!Gio: Just like what happened in Venice!Gio: We moved further up the stairs before we realized it!Gio: We're not gonna make it!JoJo-main: ,The man waiting for us at the Colosseum just entered the boss's range!Dopp: This is a test.Dopp: I've accepted this test to stand victorious against my past.Dia: A person grows once they are able to defeat their weaker self.Dia: Wouldn't you agree, Jean Pierre Polnareff?Pol: You're...Crunch,Sfx: {\c&H&\c&HCC&}RumblePol: Diavolo!Dia: It appears that no matter how much I tear apart the past,JoJo-main: ,it still manages to wriggle up like a worm from under a rock.Dia: This is surprising.JoJo-main: ,No wonder I couldn't think of anyone who opposed me.Pol: How did you get here?!Dia: But in the end,Dia: it doesn't matter how you survived after I scattered your remains in the ocean.Dia: What's important, Polnareff,JoJo-main: ,is what you were trying to tell Bucciarati and his men!Pol: Don't you dare set foot on those stairs!Pol: I'm up here! You're down there!Dia: Why won't you fight yourself, Polnareff?Dia: Because you no longer have the mental capacity for it?Dia: Or are you no longer physically able to fight?dia: What are you going to use that arrow for?Pol: This is impossible. I'm sure it was a kid down there!Pol: Diavolo... When did you get so close to me?Dia: You're the one below me, Polnareff!Dia: As long as you are below in Hell,JoJo-main: ,it doesn't matter what you plan to do with that arrow!Pol: There!

What is it doing to Chariot?!Dia: There's some kind of power behind this glow!Dia: Time, resume!Dia: Impossible! What did you do?JoJo-main: ,The arrow does more than just draw out Stand abilities?Pol: This is my gamble to keep the arrow from Diavolo.Pol: I didn't want to show him that,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,but I don't have the power to fully control the arrow any longer.Dia: You won't get away!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HFC&\c&HBAD&}s*abPol: That arrow is our hope...Pol: The one who can fully control that arrow will be the one to control the world.Gio: I-It happened again!

I currently don't have the power to control Chariot or make it disappear.Turtle: I don't even know where it is right now.Turtle: Chariot has basically gone berserk.Mista: Your own Stand went berserk?JoJo-main: ,How irresponsible can you—Nara: No. More importantly, what happened with the boss?Nara: What happened to him?Nara: Where is Diavolo right now?Turtle: I don't know.JoJo-main: ,Diavolo was right in front of me, but he disappeared.Turtle: All of you, listen very carefully.Turtle: The arrow is not your enemy, nor is it your friend!Turtle: What I'm about to explain to you is hope!Turtle: Such a trivial... trivial coincidence happened two years ago.Turtle: After I was incapacitated by Diavolo,JoJo-main: ,I somehow managed to survive and hid in a small farming village.Turtle: That's where the trivial thing occurred.Turtle: The arrow we had retrieved in Egypt fell between the wall and some furniture.Turtle: It's truly an insignificant thing.Turtle: Normally, one would just stick their arm back there and pick it up.Turtle: But for my body, it was an arduous task.Turtle: I thought about just leaving it there,Turtle: but I figured that Chariot could get it for me.Turtle: That's when it happened.Turtle: Chariot hurt its finger on the arrow.Turtle: It was mere coincidence.Turtle: The arrow draws out Stands from those who have potential.Turtle: But if it happens to pierce a Stand...Turtle: I don't know how old that arrow is,Turtle: but I'm starting to understand what the person who created it was thinking.Turtle: There's more to the power of a Stand!Turtle: Something that goes far deeper!Turtle: Suddenly, the birds in the sky fell,Turtle: bugs hid beneath leaves, and cattle laid on the ground.Turtle: And the farmers started sleeping in the streets.Turtle: I felt a slight change, but a much bigger change had taken over Chariot.Turtle: I had a bad feeling, so I immediately took the arrow away from it...Turtle: before it could go berserk.Turtle: Everything went back to normal, as if nothing had happened.Turtle: Then I realized that if someone who had enough power were to use this arrow,Turtle: they would have the power to control the minds of all living creatures!Turtle: But I currently don't have that kind of power.JoJo-main: ,And that's why I waited...Turtle: for someone like you who was searching for Diavolo's true identity.Turtle: Though, in the end, Diavolo was able to outdo me.Trish: So this controlling minds thing...JoJo-main: ,Do you mean the thing going on right now?Trish: It's just swapping souls?Turtle: No.Turtle: Remember when I said that this was just a part of its power?Turtle: I can't control it, so I wasn't able to see its potential beyond that.Turtle: But it definitely exists!Turtrle: Go retrieve the arrow!JoJo-main: ,Stop Chariot before the boss can, and reclaim the arrow!Turtle: The only way to defeat Emperor CrimsonTurtle: is for you to use the arrow to its full potential!Turtle: So in order to take back the arrow, you're telling us to k*ll Chariot.Turtle: Am I assuming too much?Turtle: That's fine.JoJo-main: ,Once you take the arrow, Chariot will be destroyed regardless.Turtle: Besides, I've already been finished off.Turtle: There's one other unbelievable and important thing that I need to tell you.Turtle: Are you the girl called Trish?Mista: Yes, though I currently have hairy knuckles.Turtle: I see...Turtle: The boss is a duo.Turtle: There was a kid who was somehow able to transform into you and trick Bucciarati.Turtle: Diavolo and this kid were like a well-coordinated team.Mista: What? B-But how?Nara: But that's impossible.JoJo-main: ,The boss trusts no one. That's how he kept his identity secret for so long.Turtle: I'm not sure what happened, either...JoJo-main: ,But there was definitely a mysterious kid.Turtle: If it wasn't for that kid, there's no way I'd have let Diavolo get that close to me.Nara: Two... So the boss is a duo?Nara: What's...Gio: Giorno! Something's moving!Gio: Nine o'clock. Uno signal.Gio: It's a person!JoJo-main: ,There's a person heading in from the gate on the right!Mista: H-He's...Mista: That face!Mista: The boss! No... Diavolo!Nara: Narancia...JoJo-main: ,Get Li'l Bomber behind him—Turtle: Giorno, wait!Turtle: The left! Look to the left, in the shadows!Turtle: So there it is!Turtle: That's my Stand, which the arrow evolved...Turtle: Chariot Requiem!Nara: He's—Nara: Th-This isn't good!Nara: Diavolo was looking for Chariot!Nara: He's trying to get the arrow!Turtle: Giorno, wait!Turtle: Don't att*ck just yet!Mista: That Stand!Nara: It's Zipper Man!Gio: Th-That's Bucciarati!Gio: It's Bucciarati's...JoJo-main: ,soul!

What I just said isn't a hypothesis.Turtle: I've even heard of reports from Germany and EnglandJoJo-main: ,where the individual's physical features change depending on the personality.Turtle: Requiem's ability tore his soul away from his body.Turtle: One of them, the kid, ended up in Bucciarati's body,Turtle: but the other one...JoJo-main: ,And it could be coincidental, but they ended up in someone else's body.Turtle: That's who Diavolo is!Turtle: Emperor Crimson att*cked from their body!Trish: What are you talking about?Gio: Two personalities?Mista: That's who the boss really is?Turtle: Slowly but surely, people are waking up outside.Turtle: So I don't know where he's hiding.Turtle: But he will come again!Turtle: He'll att*ck again, and soon!Dia: That's possible...Dia: But he could've already left the area.Dia: Diavolo is also after the arrow.JoJo-main: ,That's why he att*cked Narancia first.Dia: He got rid of our radar first.Dia: So we wouldn't be able to tell that he was going after the arrow.Dia: That's why he took down Li'l Bomber.Turtle: This just means you'll have to obtain the arrow's power after all.Turtle: Either way, if you're going to destroy Emperor Crimson,Turtle: you need to find the arrow before he does, and get it away from Chariot somehow.Dia: Which way did Requiem go?Turtle: To the left.Turtle: It looks like people are starting to wake up in the direction he's headed.Mista: Find it?

I must do something.King: Requiem keeps moving farther away.King: This rookie, Giorno Giovanna...Gio: He's hiding in one of us.Gio: But despite that, we have one advantage.Gio: Diavolo can make Emperor Crimson appear,JoJo-main: ,but he doesn't have complete control of the body he's inhabiting right now.Gio: If he had total controlGio: of the body he's currently inhabiting, he wouldn't just stay quietly hidden.Gio: It's because he can't manifest and move around freelyJoJo-main: ,that we all still live and haven't been eliminated.Gio: In a sense, we have him cornered.Trish: It's the turtle!JoJo-main: ,It was the closest one to my revolver!Trish: Polnareff is the one who's possessed!Gio: That's not possible.Gio: Mr. Polnareff was almost k*lled by Requiem earlier,Gio: because the boss destroyed the revolver.Gio: The boss won't let the body he's inhabiting be put in danger.Gio: Plus...Gio: I only sense one being's life force.Gio: This turtle only has one soul in it.Dia: You can tell that, Giorno?Gio: Only if I can get closer and touch their body.Trish: How can you be so certain?Gio: Life force is a mass.Gio: If I actually touch someone, I can tell how many there are.Gio: There's no other way.JoJo-main: ,I have to touch each one of you and find out.Dia: But how are you going to get closer within Emperor Crimson's range?Gio: I learned how to detect Emperor Crimson from Mr. Polnareff.Gio: The moment the droplets suddenly increase is when time has skipped!Turtle: Correct.Turtle: But whether you can avoid his att*ck or not will be a matter of luck,Turtle: as is whether you'll be able to just barely dodge it.Trish: It's definitely not me.Trish: When Narancia was k*lled, I was the farthest away.Gio: Then I'll check you firstso we can be at ease.Trish: Hey!Trish: Stop right there! Stay away from me!Trish: D-Don't come any closer!Trish: If Diavolo is actually in you, what's going to happen to me?Gio: When Narancia d*ed, his body was empty.Gio: My soul was able to travel from Narancia's body into my own,Gio: but it was empty.Gio: There's no chance that he's possessing me.Trish: Oh, really?Trish: That's just what you're saying.Trish: I have no way of confirming your ability.Trish: Not to mention, Giorno,JoJo-main: ,do you have a way to definitively confirm that you only have one soul?Trish: You can't check yourself with your own ability, can you?Gio: Mista, we can't go after the arrow unless we find out!Trish: Come any closer and I'll blow your limbs off!Dia: Stop!Dia: Check me first, Giorno.Dia: Hurry up and do it!Dia: We're losing more and more time.Dia: Just as you said,JoJo-main: ,depending on how we look at the situation, we have the boss cornered.Turtle: There's no other way.JoJo-main: ,Yes...Turtle: We have to do this right now.Trish: Someone's going to be att*cked...Mista: If we get closer to one another...Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HD&\c&HCFFB&}SliceTrish: Giorno!Mista: It's Mista!JoJo-main: ,He was the one possessed!Mista: Spicy Lady—Dia: No, Trish!Dia: It's you!Dia: He got closer instantly by moving your body closer to him!King: I've been waiting for this moment, my daughter...King: The moment you unleashed your Stand!Who_swapped_with,King: Diagram of swapped soulsBucciarati,Sign: {\pos(.,.)}BucciaratiBucciarati,Sign: {\an\fs\pos(,)}His body has d*ed(which means Doppio has also d*ed)Bucciarati,Sign: {\an\pos(.,.)}Trish            MistaBucciarati,Sign: {\an\fs\pos(.,.)}Diavolo(Emperor Crimsonhad possessed him)Bucciarati,Sign: {\pos(.,)}GiornoBucciarati,Sign: {\an\pos(.,.)}Turtle   PolnareffKing: My daughter...King: If you hadn't revealed your Stand, I might've actually been cornered...Dia: Zipper Man!King: If I can grab the Stand, I can also move the body.King: Now I can at least make this body run.Dia: We're going to be att*cked!

I want you to settle this once and for all!Guy: Please make him, the bastard who's still living his life as usual, experienceGuy: these tears of despair that I'm crying!Bruno: Life is full of hardships.Bruno: I feel for you, but I can't agree to this.Bruno: Are you trying to imply that we're some assassins who would lynch just anyone?Guy: Everyone in this town relies on you.Guy: I'm just asking for the rightful punishment!Bruno: The rightful punishment?Bruno: Florist, earlier, you asked if we could talk privately.Bruno: That was because you knew how dangerous this conversation is, wasn't it?Bruno: But what you said about something only her family would know...JoJo-main: ,I can't take that lightly.Bruno: To think that no one involved with the law was moved byJoJo-main: ,those words in the past six months...Bruno: I find that rather unbelievable.Bruno: I can at least try to make this boyfriend talk.Bruno: I'll only ask for that payment once we confirm that he's actually guilty.Bruno: Does that work for you?Guy: Mr. Bucciarati!Bruno: Mista.Bruno: I'd like you to look into this.Mista: Sure.Bad_luck,Sign: Bad luckMista: What the heck...Bad_luck,Sign: {\c&HD&\c&HBBD&\c&HACFAD&}Bad luckMista: is this rock?Bad_luck,Sign: {\fad(,)\c&HB&\c&HBE&\shad\bord}k*ll meAbba: Mista, make sure you put that back.Mista: Uh...
