Losing your hearing, old man?  I just told him my next pitch.  I'm going to throwa high, outside fastball.  Jotaro!  To believe?Or not to believe?  Not too bright, are you?  My Stand can peer intoyour soul in the same way   that a thermal imager detectsan object's radiation.   It doesn't matter what Jotaro may say,his soul cannot lie.   Yes or no? Right or left?   By analyzing your soul, I can seethe answer to any yes-or-no question.   Outside or inside? High or low?   Fastball or curveball?   My Stand is infallible.    A high, outside fastball?    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART      Yes or no?   Jotaro is telling the truth.   He's going to pitcha high, outside fastball.   This is no ruse.   What is he up to?   He b*at my brother by bluffing,   but he thinksthat will work with me?   You fool!   Here it comes.   Don't forget, you loseif you fall eleven runs behind.   What? A curve!   That wasn't a high,outside fastball!   And he hit it!   But it's a grounder!Throw to first! He's out!   I don't believe it.   There was no way he wasn't throwinga high, outside fastball.   No one's soul can lie.Not even the great Buddha's.   Not even my brother's,the world's greatest con man!   Next is another high, outside fastball.   He's not lying. He's serious!   Jotaro, you don't intend to have mebelieve you're cheating right now, do you?   I do!   What?   He's cheating?   A low, inside forkball!   Fly ball! The pitcher caught it!   Out!   You cheated!Jotaro, you bastard!   You must've tamperedwith the console!   What?   So he didn't tamper with it?   I know you're cheating!   Now come clean!   No response.   Damn! I have to aska yes-or-no question!   Looks like you can readmy thoughts   only when it's a yes-or-no question.   Like your brother used to say,   it's not cheatingif you aren't caught.   It's not cheatingif you aren't caught?   How dare you?   Do you knowwho you're talking to?   Go ahead and pitch, Jotaro!   I'll figure out your trickand take your soul!   Now, then.Shall we continue?   My next pitch will be...   A high, outside fastball.   Jotaro's soul isn't lying.   He is genuinely goingto pitch a high, outside fastball.   I'll figure outhow you're cheating!   This ends now!   He hasn't changed his mind.   It's still a "yes."He's going to throw it!   Here it comes!   It's still a "yes."He threw a fastball!   It tumbled! A forkball!   What? It's a different pitch!   Out! That's three outs! Change!   I don't get it! I can't figure outhow he's cheating?   Jotaro's soul kept sayinghe'd throw a fastball,   but it curved!   How is he deceiving me?   You're done for, D'Arby.   Shut up!   It's the hat!Why did you take off your hat?   You've been cheatingever since you took that hat off!   Move! I'm checkingyour station and controller.   Damn you!How did you do it?   I don't suppose, it has somethingto do with that hat,   does it?   The culprit is somewherearound here!   You're using Star Platinumto cheat, aren't you?   You're doing something, Jotaro!Admit it!   Damn it!   I can read people's minds!   And I can read Jotaro's thoughts!   How does his mind throwthe ball one way,   but his body throws it another?   He, uh... looks like he's losinghis youthful glow.   He definitely doesn't look likea guy in his twenties anymore.   D'Arby, it's your turn.    Hurry up and throw it.    Four to three...    Only a one-point difference.I can b*at him.    I am a video game genius!    I cannot lose.    I am a video game genius!    I cannot lose.My mind is a steel trap.    I've won every match!I'm invincible!    A video game expertis an expert at life!    You thinkyou can shake my confidence?    It's in! It's a home run!    Another run for the Jaguars!    It's five to three!    No! I inadvertentlyreleased his soul!    Kakyoin's soul just...He's conscious!    No! I didn't admit defeat!    It was an accident!Releasing his soul was a mistake!    If you released his soul,then that means...    your soul admitted defeat.    What?    Joseph's Stand,he entwined it around the controller.    Oh, whoops.    Something so idiotic...    The cheat was...The one manipulating the controller...    Damn it...    So Jotaro wasn't controlling it.It was you, Joseph Joestar!    That's right, D'Arby.    I'm sure your brother would havefigured it out a long time ago.    By the way, old man.    I'm glad you caught on to my secret idea.    Of course! I know exactlywhat you're thinking!    You're my grandson!    Come on, Kakyoin.    Damn it... From behind...    Now...    What to do with you?    You have to forgive me!I gave you Kakyoin's soul back!    Everything's back to normal now!    We're good! Right?    If you want to knowwhether I'll forgive you,    why don't you just read my mind?    Tell me, will I hit youwith my right fist or my left?    Guess.    Just get it over with.You'll use your right.    Your left?    Both?    Are you going to dothe "ora-ora" thing?    Yes! Oh my God!    D'Arby Younger: Out of commission!    Looks like we broke throughsome sort of wall.    That's our ticket out of here,Jotaro! Kakyoin!    Good grief.    Forgive me for disturbing you, master,    but as I'm sure you arealready aware,    about ten minutes ago,    Joestar and his comradesinfiltrated the manor.    I must also inform youthat D'Arby has been defeated.    D'Arby was a genius.    With such competence and acumen,D'Arby should have won.    Why do you thinkhe suffered defeat?    Come in, Cool Ice.    As you wish.    The Joestars    are unconditionally preparedto sacrifice their own lives    in order to save their family.    Kakyoin and the other two...    What were their names...    Ah, yes...    Avdol and Polnareff are willingto die to destroy me.    They believe running from mewould mean running from themselves.    Such fools.    But that is their strength.    D'Arby may have swornhis loyalty to me,    but he was not preparedto die on my behalf.    That is why, at the edge of glory,he could not clinch victory.    For all eternity,D'Arby will remain in ignorance.    Ice...    Look at the scar on my neck.    Jonathan Joestar's bodyis still rejecting me.    But all it takes is the bloodof one more soul.    The body will become mine,and the wound will heal.    Ice...    Will you give me your life's blood?    Yes, master. With pleasure.    What is mine is yours!    You beheaded yourself.    Most splendid.    But Cool Ice,    I cannot accept the bloodof such a loyal servant.    I shall heal my woundwith another's blood.    You must live.    To your rebirth.    Your resolve shall secureyour victory.    Dio, my lord.    One's own body is always best.    You are ready.    Take care of them, Cool Ice.    Lord Dio...    I will not let you down.    I promise, I shall destroyevery one of them.    You need not helpwith the door.    Your Stand can completely vanishfrom this dimension.     COOL ICE    The ten minutes are up.    Mister Joestar said to setthe mansion ablaze,    but I say we go in after them.    Yeah.    Before we proceed, there's somethingI have to tell you, Polnareff.    If you lose your way or are injuredand can't go on,    I will not save you.    Iggy, the same goes for you.    I know it sounds cruel,    but we've come here to defeat Dio.    If I become injuredor separated from you,    promise me you won't attemptto save me either.    You must think of your own safetyfirst and foremost.    We can't let ourselves get k*lledtrying to save one another.    Yeah, I got it, Avdol.    If we get out of here alive,    you'd better treat meto a mind-blowing feast of a dinner.    I'll treat you and Iggy, both.    All right, let's go.    Silver Chariot!    Hey, Avdol. What should we do?    It looks like it goes on forever.    I know Mister Joestar told usto set the mansion on fire,    but this structure isan immense labyrinth.    Setting it alight would put us allin grave danger.    Instead...    Magician's Red!    The flames detect lifeforms.    They will sense anything that breathes,human or animal.    They can even detect cutaneous respirationand minute movements.    They will also sense a Stand's energy.    The flames will lead the way.    Why are there six flames?    There is a flame for each ofthe four directions,    as well as ones for the spaceabove and below us.    If something is hiddenwithin fifteen meters,    regardless of size,the flames will detect its presence.    Mister Joestar and the otherswere pulled below us.    Let's head down.    The flames alreadypicked up something.    There's something in front of us,to the left.    What?    The Fool!    Hey. Who is this guy?    -Look around us, Polnareff!-Huh?    The maze! It's gone!    His Stand created this illusion.    When Iggy slashed him, it vanished.    His name, Billie Jean.Defeated without resistance!    The mansion is back to normal.    For now, at least,the flames aren't detecting anything.    HE WHO READS THIS CARVINGAND TURNS ABACK SHALL...    HE WHO READS THIS CARVINGAND TURNS ABACK SHALL...     PERISH    The flames don't sense anything.    Iggy hasn't picked upanything, either.    What is this thing?    Impossible! My flamesand Iggy's nose didn't sense it!    Where did it come from?    Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!    Hey, Avdol! Where are you?    What was that just now?    Whose arms are those?    Hey, Avdol!    Where are you?    Avdol!    Where are you?    Avdol!    Avdol!    What the hell is that?    Where did it come from?    Why didn't Avdol's flames sense it?    Hey, Iggy!    You couldn't smell himwith your nose?    Answer me!    Where are you, Avdol?    Where did you go?    Avdol...    has been disintegrated.He is dead.    Beyond my jaws liesan endless void.    A dark dimension unto whichmy own understanding reaches not.    Your ally is already gone.    You two are next.    Your arrogance will not last.    One by one, each in his place,    I shall strew your atomic fragmentsacross the void.    I don't believe you.    It's impossible.    Avdol can't be dead.    You lie!    -Is fate telling me to live on?-I heard another wall fall down.    -More sounds of destruction?-He's full of spite.    I will eliminate you.    Don't let his spite overcome you!    -There's no time to deal with the pain.-Suck on my sword and die!
