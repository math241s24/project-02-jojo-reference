That'd take you hours.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,He'd sleep over at his delinquent friends' houses,Nar: and get by daily by eating the food he had stolen that day.Nara: It all went as planned!Nara: It's all because you told us about that shop, Bro.Blonde: You sure you don't need to go to school?blonde: You actually come from a decent home.Nara: Like I give a sh*t about that home.Nara: The most important thing in this world is friendship!Blonde: Yeah.Blonde: You should dye your hair blonde like mine.JoJo-flashback: ,Then the chicks would be all over you.Nara: Yeah!Guy: What? Seriously?Nara: What do you think?Guy: You look so dumb!Nara: Hey, where's Bro?Guy: Who knows? I haven't seen him in a few days.Nara: Huh...Nar: But the next day...Nara: You bastards!Cop: Put both hands on the wall!Cop: You little sh*t! You're going to juvenile hall!Nara: What the hell are you talking about?! Me, a robber?!Nara: Of course I'm no—Cop: Quit lyin'! We have a witness!Nara: Wha—Lady: That's him! That blonde brat is the suspect!Nara: N-No, I'm not!Lady: I'm sure of it! He b*at me up and took my money!Nara: Quit lyin', you old hag!

But Bro is...Nara: He felt trapped, so he used me as a scapegoat...Nar: The one most afraid of these rumors concerning the eye diseaseNar: was Narancia himself.Nara: This is fate...Nara: Soon... just like Mom...Nara: I'm going to die from this eye disease!Nar: That's what he believed. He had nowhere to go.Nar: He was all alone.Nar: Narancia had given up on life at the age of fifteen.Lady: How awful. He's just a child.Old: It's a pity, but we shouldn't get involved.Nar: The boy brought Narancia into a restaurant,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,then told his friend at the table and the shop's host...Fugo: I'd like to feed him some spaghetti!Fugo: You don't mind, do you?Nar: His friend at the table didn't ask any questions,Nar: nor did he give him a look of disgust.Nar: He just set the plate of spaghetti he'd ordered for himselfNar: in front of the filthy child.Nar: He then had the kid receive the treatment he needed.Nar: Three weeks later...Nara: Why are you doing all this for me?Bruno: There's no reason.Bruno: If you want, you can stay at my house.Bruno: But kids like you should go back home to their parents.Bruno: Also, go to school. Got it?Nara: U-Um, are you in a g*ng?Nara: I don't want to go back home.Nara: Please let me work for you!Bruno: Don't be so naïve, you little sh*t!Bruno: If you say that again, I'll punch you!Nar: As instructed, Narancia went back home and even started going back to school.Nar: But he could never trust his father again.Nara: Why did he get so serious about scolding me?Nara: There's nothing special about me.Nara: But...JoJo-flashbackinternal: ,That rage didn't come from hate or disgust,JoJo-flashbackinternal: ,and it didn't feel like it was meant to insult me.Nara: It was totally different from when my dad or those cops got mad at me.Nara: When I think about how he acted, I feel confident.Nara: Real men...Nara: should work for guys like him!Nar: Six months later, Narancia went to seeJoJo-internal/narrator: ,one of the capos of the organization, Polpo, without Bucciarati knowing...Nar: and he passed the test.Form: Narancia, if you're going to tell me where that girl is,Form: now is probably the best time to do it.Nara: The girl you're trying to kidnap doesn't belong to a g*ng or anything like that!Nara: She's just an ordinary girl!Nara: Bucciarati hates sh*t like that, even if it's an order!Nara: No decent person would like that!Nara: We said we were going to protect her,Nara: so we're going to protect her, no matter what!Form: Would you quit with your worthless drivel?Form: Well, sh*t...Form: All this crap about your friends and protecting this chick...Form: That's not what we're talking about here.Form: I'm talking about the fact that if we defeat the boss,JoJo-main: ,we'll have a drug route worth hundreds of billions.Nara: Y-You bastard!Form: Hundreds of billions!Form: That's an amount worth a few people dying over!Form: It's going to be ours! There's no turning back now!Form: Since she's the boss's daughter, she's bound to have a Stand ability!Form: The boss doesn't want people finding that out!Form: We'll definitely be able to figure out who the boss is through his daughter's ability!Form: His daughter is a hint for defeating the boss,JoJo-main: ,whose identity we don't even know!Nara: What? That girl's a Stand user?Form: Did you know...JoJo-main: ,In South America, there's a spider called the southern black widow.Form: Apparently its venom can even k*ll humans.Form: This spider isn't deadly.JoJo-main: ,I actually caught it in the sewers earlier. It's completely harmless.Form: But...Form: Even a normal spider's bite is venomous.Nara: Y-You aren't gonna...Form: More than venomous enough to paralyze tiny little insects and eat them!Nara: Li'l Bomber!Form: Whoa, there!Form: I told you, your Stand is powerless now!Form: This bottle is gonna be the ring, Narancia!Nara: Y-You bastard! Hey!Form: It's looking at you! It's looking right at you!Form: It's watching you carefully with all eight of its eyes!Nara: Open up! Open the bottle!Nara: Damn it!Form: Listen carefully. Even if it bites you, you won't die instantly.Form: First, its venom will paralyze your body, so you'll no longer be able to move.Form: But once you can't move and it traps you, you're in real danger.Form: Then it'll start injecting you with even more venom and digestive juices.Form: Those digestive juices will slowly melt your insides to the consistency of a milkshakeForm: so it can suck you right up.Form: And you're going to be conscious the whole time.Form: If you finally feel like talking, you can still talk while you're being eaten.Form: But you're probably better off telling me right nowForm: where the boss's daughter is.Form: I really don't want to see a person end up melted and eaten by a spider.Nara: I-It's fast!Nara: You bastard!Form: A shard of glass?!Form: He somehow got it and kept it on him?!Nara: W-Webbing?Nara: When did...Form: It bit him!Form: You can't move anymore because your muscles are spasming.Form: Just hurry up and tell me.Form: This is your last chance if you don't wanna die.Nara: Damn it... Like hell I'm gonna tell you!Nara: Damn it!Form: Looks like it's injecting its digestive juices into you now.Form: It's gonna melt you...Form: Huh?Form: What's that?Form: You dropped this when you took that shardJoJo-main: ,of glass out of your pocket, so I picked it up...Form: Maybe... I don't need you to tell me anymore.Form: This is a map of this city.Form: It's a driving map. Not only that...Form: There are things marked on here with pencil,Form: so you wouldn't get lost!Form: How stupid are you?!Form: If I follow these directions in reverse, I can see where you came from!Form: A vineyard!JoJo-main: ,You came from a vineyard that's about twenty kilometers southeast!Form: Grazie, Narancia!Form: Now you can get eaten or have that thing lay eggs in you or whatever,Form: you moron!Sign: Tiny FeetSign: FormaggioForm: Twenty kilometers southeast!Form: The boss's daughter Trishis somewhere in that area!Form: I did it! You don't have to talk anymore!Nara: My Li'l Bomber has the ability to detect and pursue carbon dioxide.Nara: But carbon dioxide doesn't just come from living creatures.Nara: It's also produced by burning things.Nara: I just remembered...Nara: When I was chasing you with Li'l Bomber,Nara: I also sh*t at the car.Nara: I'm pretty sure I sh*t the gasoline t*nk...Nara: But I can't really tell where the hole is from here.Nara: Still,JoJo-main: ,I was thinking that since the b*llet hole is technically burning, it'll haveJoJo-main: ,carbon dioxide coming from it,so I can find it using Li'l Bomber.Nara: So I sh*t at it.Nara: See, it wasn't the spider I was sh**ting at earlier.Nara: But it's a small hole,JoJo-main: ,so it took a while for the fire to actually start, and I was getting nervous!Form: What?!Nara: Damn it!Nara: All the shopping bags got b*rned to a crisp!Narancia_s_Heigh,Sign: Narancia's Height: .cm -> .cm (His normal height)Nara: But it feels great to be back at a size where a spider bite won't matter.Form: How dare you?!Form: I'm gonna m*rder all of your friends!Form: Hideout... Blergh!Form: Vineyard... Blah!Form: Just you wait, Narancia!Form: Tiny Feet!Nara: Wh-What?!Nara: He put out the fire with the blood that squirted out of his wrist?!Nara: Damn it! This isn't good!Nara: Letting him get away now is not good at all!Nara: I have to find him using Li'l Bomber's ability!Nara: Sh-sh*t!JoJo-main: ,Th-The radar...Nara: These flames...Nara: Y-You bastard! Where are you?!Form: Is this lucky or unlucky?Form: Narancia, because you set the car on fire,Form: you can't track me because of all the carbon dioxide coming from the flames!Form: I guess if this comes down to winning or losing, I've won!Nara: You're not getting away!Form: I know where the boss's daughter is.Form: Now I just need to get out of here and let my buddies know.Form: We'll m*rder you all!Form: Assassinations are our specialty!Nara: Assassinations?Form: I'll make sure I pay you back for this soon!JoJo-main: ,You won't be able to find me anymore!Form: I win!Bazoo,Sfx: {\c&HCCE&\c&HAE&}BoooooomNara: If I can't track your breathing...Nara: If the flames are too big...Nara: I'll just make them bigger!Nara: If I set the whole damn street on fire,JoJo-main: ,you'll burn up and die because you're so tiny!Nara: You're not getting away, Formaggio!Form: Are you mad, you bastard?Form: You actually set the whole street on fire!Form: Are you sane? You bastard!Form: Huh?!Nara: I guess I don't need to set the whole city on fire now.Form: When I asked if you were sane,Form: what you basically did was tell me that you want me to k*ll you as soon as possible.Form: Thanks to the flames, I was able to get this close to you.Form: Did you forget?Form: At this distance, my Stand is faster than yours!Nara: It might be.Form: Bring it, Narancia...Form: Tiny Feet!Form: Well, sh*t...Form: I guess your little shopping trip wasn't as easy as you thought it'd be,Form: was it, Narancia?Form: Now things are going to get more difficult...Form: for you bastards!Nara: "Go shopping," they tell me...Nara: Mission... incomplete.Nara: Both the money and the stuff I bought...Nara: went up in flames...Fugo: Narancia, repeat it one more time.Nara: I told you, the shopping—Fugo: Not that!JoJo-main: ,You just said the enemy found out where we're hiding.Nara: But I took care of him right after—Fugo: That's not the issue here!Abba: Bucciarati, we should get the hell out of here.Fugo: After I warned you so many times...Fugo: You fool!Gio: I think Narancia did a great job stopping the enemy.Gio: I think he did everything he should've done.Gio: And now that the Hitman Team knows about us, if he's a reasonable boss,Gio: he should give us a method of escape.Gio: I don't think we should leave until we hear from the boss.Fugo: Well, aren't you clever?Fugo: Do you think you're an advisor now?Abba: And how do you know that the boss will contact us soon?Abba: No one cares about your damn hunches!Mista: Bucciarati!Mista: I think we got a message from the boss!Sign: Message for BucciaratiMista: This is how the boss always sends his orders to the capos.Mista: This is the first time Bucciarati's received one!Bruno: I'll check out the message.Bruno: "Head to the Pompeii Archaeological Park. I've hidden a key near the dog mosaic."Bruno: Look into that immediately!Bruno: "That key is for a vehicle that'll bring my daughter safely to me."Abba: Vehicle? What does he mean by a safe vehicle?Nara: A helicopter!Nara: That must be a key to a helicopter!Nara: We can go anywhere in a helicopter without anyone following us!Bruno: It's a bit less than fifteen kilometers from here to Pompeii.Bruno: An hour should be plenty of time to get over there and get the key.Bruno: Fugo! Abbacchio! Giorno!Bruno: You three head to Pompeii and get that key!Bruno: Mista, Narancia, and I will remain here and protect Trish from the Hitman Team.Bruno: Retrieve the key, and if it seems safe, contact us.Bruno: Then we'll take Trish and head to over to that vehicle.Bruno: I'm counting on you.
