Speedwagon will always speed swiftly to your side whenever necessary, Mr.Joestar.But, I wouldn't want to roll over your romance.Mr.Joestar! I wish you a jovial journey! Atlantic Ocean - American Passage The poor bird's one wing won't work It's fallen from the flock Erina, what's wrong? Why are you weeping? I'm shedding tears of joy, because we're together now.I've got the gentleman who further wrought the wrath of bullies by displaying a handkerchief with his proud name, Jonathan Joestar.I couldn't ask for anything more.Neither could I.I've married the miss who bandaged and embraced me with her warmth, while I was enveloped in a frigid darkness, Erina.I'm pleased to have protected the world that you know and love.If only Father could have met you Erina, let's go to dinner.Jonathan-! I-I was trying to warn you I wish our happiness would be eternal Christ, it fell in the engine room! Of all the filthy fields it could've fallen into I could curse the clergy for all I care, but the rosary is my only resource.O God in Heaven Why do you keep sending me to these Godforsaken places? I couldn't.I've never indulged before.Indulge a little.A sip shall suffice.It's rather light, so sip some.Sip.A-Aren't you Jonathan? Could it be It couldn't! Dio still lives? Erina, return to our cabin! And lock the door behind you! This is a peculiar coffin The pad is unlocked.It's a bit bizarre, in fact.I can see the coffin's clasp shimmer from within But wouldn't that mean that this coffin could only be opened from inside?! Halt! Aren't you There's my beautiful body.D-Dio! Jonathan seemed quite jarred Something's off! Look at what I've become, Jojo.I wanted you to see what became of a God.And why do I degrade my dignity by displaying my head? Even though you've thwarted my plans, time and time again, you've earned my respect.I commend your courage, envy your vigor, and respect your resilience.And it's dawned upon me Dio Jojo Were it not for you, I would've never been bestowed the blessings of the stone mask.But were it also not for you, I would've ruled the world by now.If there is a God, and if He does facilitate fates, then I can only conclude that He purposely twisted ours to each other.I've realized that without you, I am incomplete.Therein, your body is the only one that would make me whole again, and with it, my eternal existence shall be an ecstatic one! That is the destiny of Dio Brando! I shall be swift with the stroke, as my respect for my revered rival requires it! H-His eyes! T-They glow! Your body shall be mine to have, Jojo! Jonathan! J-Jonathan! Erina! Now why would you do that? If you hadn't moved, I could've blasted through your brain.You wouldn't have to suffer as much as you do now.We've gone from dining in a hall to dining in Hell.The sight of the unsightly has left the lady speechless, has it? Jojo never did tell you the tales of my deeds, did he? I may be but a head, but surely, you recall your first kiss Erina Pendleton? My mistake.Mrs.Erina Joestar, is it not? Dio?! The boat's been beset by beasts! As per your instruction, I infected one passenger, who went on to infect others for the horde! And you shall have an even greater horde once we've reached America.I can't speak I can't even breathe I must breathe Erina Erina! I shall save you! I can't channel a Ripple! Behold, Lord Dio! The accursed cur can't even breathe! If he can't breathe, the Ripple is useless to him! Shall I smother out what life he has remaining now, in return for humiliating you, Lord Dio? Or perhaps we should watch him writhe in agony? Asphyxiation should only last a few more minutes.Watch your tongue, Wang Chung.Do not disrespect Jojo.He was the only human who forced me to survive as a head.Out of respect, I don't to prolong his suffering any longer, so go, and sever the sod's head! As you wish, Lord Dio.His beautiful body shall become my beautiful break! Jonathan! Be wary of his movements! Withdraw, Wang! He's bound to try something before succumbing! What's there to be wary about?! Lord Dio respect for this cur has left him too cautious! I shall scoop out your skull with my claws you stupid simpleton! I shall save Erina I have one breath to give One faint, yet final Ripple to channel I shall unleash every ounce of my Ripple energy! It shall suffice! W-Withdraw now, Wang Chung! I-I've lost something As if that something has all but vanished But what could it be? Curses! I-It was my lifeforce I channeled it all into my final Ripple I-It was too weak to destroy that zombie, but I've made use of him.I-Impossible! Jojo must've done something to Wang Chung's body! The Ripple didn't destroy his body, but controlled his body's tissue instead! Wang Chung's body is ordered to halt that shaft.A-And that shaft he's stopping is the ship's paddle-wheel propeller shaft! A zombie's strength is sufficient enough to stop the shaft, and if the shaft is stopped, the steam in the pistons remain trapped, causing pressure to increase from within! If that pressure causes the piston walls to rupture, the ship will explode! Jonathan! How could this be? How could this happen to you? How? E-Escape, Erina T-This ship's set to explode I have no idea how things came to be this way and equally, I don't know whether I should cry, scream, or faint.I'm at an utter loss.But I can do one thing.I, Erina Joestar, will accompany you in death.I can feel the warmth fade from his lips Why, oh why? I can feel his life slipping away.My beloved Jonathan Joestar will die But if we can be together in death, let this embrace last.When the ship explodes, everything will be set ablaze and our ashes will be scattered into the sea.Weep as you will, but I need you to live on, my love You're so selfish! How could you ask me to save the babe and myself?! I can't be the one to do it! My only desire is to die together with you! As that babe's mother d*ed in its stead my mother did the same for me! Take the babe and escape! You never cease to amaze me with your cunning, Jojo! Even in death, you manage to lead my ambitions askew! But I've learned from your cunning and resilience! I shall survive! My existence shall be eternal, and your body shall ensure that eternity! My minions! Chow down on Wang Chung! Remove his arms and make that shaft spin! It's too late for that Jonathan! The pistons have begun exploding! But I won't be blown away by this boat or the blasted sun! I've made prior preparations in the case of an expl*si*n! Erina, get a good look at your gent! Jojo's utterly defenseless against my domination, and I shall have his body within moments! Once I've finished, I shall make my escape in that coffin! It may withstand the expl*sive force of several bombs! I call my personal b*mb shelter! Now die, Jojo! At last, I shall have my beautiful body for centuries to come! Jonathan! Dio Maybe we really are incomplete without each other.We are bizarre brothers, you and I.And now, our fate shall be shared together in death, with the expl*si*n to scatter our ashes.Farewell, my love Erina Unhand me, Jojo! Let me go and we'll think this through, together! I shall allow your existence to be eternal as well! I shall seal your stings, and you can live with Erina for all eternity, Jojo! Jojo?!
