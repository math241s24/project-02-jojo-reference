02x16 - Cuba LibreQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/19/23 20:23In New York City's w*r on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.These are their stories.Just eight days more to go.I'm going crazy thinking about it.Me, too, sweetheart.That's enough of that.You are so funny.He never wants to see me again? Your father's upset.You didn't visit him while he was away.I had no access.She took me off the visitors list.Jack, you know I only do what Milt asks.Stop.Just stop.You should be ashamed of yourself.- I'm sorry, Jack.He's - Don't worry.Milt wants to make sure you get what's coming to you.Don't forget your brothers behind the wall now.I'll keep it real.I'm gonna miss you, Milton.Same here, brother.Come here.Maybe your luck will change now that you don't have to play me.But who will make dinner for Mr.Milt? We'll figure something out.Tonight, I want him all to myself.Oh, I don't want to set off the security system when he gets here.You want me to show you how? Uh, no.Just turn the stupid thing off.Okay.Look at this.Two years here turned me into a lean machine.So what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get out? Oh, Milt! - Oh! You're the only one.- My little sweetheart.The only one! Baby.Must be the little blue pills.It's like it has wings on it.Wings! Oh! Must be dinner.I'm famished.I'll get it.You go take your shower.Pam? Pam! No! Those bastards! You bastards! Law & Order CI These entry wounds, chest, shoulder, knee.The sh**t had no control and couldn't resist ripping her earring off.Like some subway punk.He sprayed the doorway in an arc, even hit the upper window.You know, the sh*ts came from down below, but not at the bottom of the stairs.Check the service entrance.Well, I got five, six, seven nine millimeter casings.He rang the doorbell up there and ran down here to hide? No.He rang the doorbell down here.He thought the service entrance was the main door.Here.She answers the door.He's surprised.He sh**t wild, probably one-handed, - cocked to one side.- Like in the gangster flicks.He's not used to the recoil.He loses control of the piece.She'd ordered dinner.The security cameras must have been off, so she had to go to the door to see who was there.Why were they off? The security system's very sophisticated.My wife, less so.She must have turned it off when she sent the maid home.Well, let's talk about who might have wanted your wife dead.Any candidates? Nobody.She was an angel.We had just finished making beautiful love.They were after me.All due respect, even in a snowstorm, no one would mistake her for you.You think that's funny? I have enemies everywhere.Like your ex-business partner.You were convicted of hiring a hit man to k*ll him.Do I look incompetent? Hmm? If I wanted him dead, he would have been dead.Your conviction was a frame-up, by your enemies.Exactly.My competitors.In the clothing business? This "Winter Clothes For All Seasons." This is the original store.Yeah, up in Harlem.That's my dad on the left, and that's me.Who's the man whose knee you're sitting on? Our tailor.Morris Swope.Long gone.So you built the chain from one store.And the bastards came after me because I refused to be undersold! Chang.Chang! Nitro.Worried about being poisoned? Can't be too safe.Great wealth meets great paranoia.Not a healthy combination.Pierre's, the restaurant Milt said they ordered from, had no record of any order.He told his wife he ordered dinner.That's why she opened the door.And knowing what was coming, made beautiful love to her.Well, that's what made it more exciting for him.Going by his trial testimony, the man's all about suspicion and revenge.Revenge for what? Don't tell me the lovely Mrs.Winters was cheating on the old coot while he was still in prison.Apparently not, if you believe the cook, the maid, the driver, and the Pilates instructor.Milt loved Pam.Pam loved Milt.Everything was hunky-dory.Well, there might be one Winters who's not closing ranks.Milton Junior.He was called as a character witness at his father's trial, but he never showed up.My mother taught me if you can't say anything nice about someone So you skipped your dad's trial.And the reason you didn't visit him in jail? Pamela had him take my name off the visitors list.She had him wrapped around her little finger.I won't say she had it coming, but You know, usually, in a m*rder investigation, people try to hide their joy at the victim's death.I'll try to remember that.You're an only child, right? Yeah./ Well, with his wife out of the way, you stand to inherit.Dad made a point of cutting me out of his will years ago, so I wouldn't be tempted to k*ll him.That's my dad, always looking out for me.Well, at least you've learned not to take his peculiarities personally.How can I? Dad's sick.A brilliant businessman, but sick.So he would've protected himself from Pamela./ Well, I'm sure.With a pre-nup? Pre-nups, plural.I heard he was having his lawyer redraft the originals.Well, assuming Pamela would go along with a new pre-nup.Gee, suppose she said no.I don't care how many subpoenas you pull out of your ass, you have no right to stick your nose in my legal business.That's the point of getting a subpoena, to give us that right.The material you're after is covered by attorney-client privilege.That privilege was waived when you discussed redrafting the pre-nup with Mrs.Winters.Who said anything about redrafting? - Your son.- What? That rat.He talks to you, and he doesn't talk to me? I can't believe this.Look, if you're gonna get upset, why don't you just wait outside, and we all talk to your lawyer.I see what you're doing.You people will do anything, say anything to pin this on me.The worst scum in the pen have more honor than any of you.I loved my wife.I loved her.You loved her so much, you were drafting a new pre-nup.A pre-nup that increased her stake in his estate as reward for her fidelity during his prison stay.Not that Pamela cared.Money was the least of her concerns.What? It was your idea to give your money away? I mean, guys with your pathology, they usually build an armor around what they have.I'm not taking this bait.I'm not afraid of you.I'm not afraid of this whole machinery of justice.I'm not."Money was the least of her concerns." Very nice.I almost believed you myself.I meant every word of it, Milton.Pam turned out to be a lovely girl."A lovely girl." You should know.What are you saying, Milt? I know what you did, you son of a bitch.- Milt, let Let go.- I know what you did.This pre-nup does speak toward his goodwill.Who's doing this to me? He's dead.Oh, my God.Who's doing this to me? Oh, my God.Oh, my God! Nine millimeter casings.Looks like we got a bold sh**t on our hands./ A bold sh**t on a bicycle, according to the limo driver, who unfortunately didn't see his face.Bastards! The bastards are striking at everyone I love, and you're doing nothing to stop them.Them? / My enemies, you idiot.I'm the target.You know, it looks like he's the one that took all the b*ll*ts.Jack Duvall was only important because of his relationship to me.I'm going home.Rashid! How did he ever get the impression people don't like him? Duvall's files were off-limits.Even his lunch orders fell under attorney-client privilege.Yeah.Luckily, the privilege doesn't extend to his bank records.All we got out of the secretary is that Milt was Duvall's only client.What about Duvall and Mrs.Winters? Secretary have anything to say about them? Just that Duvall always kept his office door open whenever Ms.Winters came in to see him and that he never gave her his private number.Well, Duvall knew how crazy Milt is.Look at this.Over the last few months, Duvall issued a dozen checks from his escrow accounts, all for under $10,000, all to small businesses.For losses from fire damages, accidents.He was helping settle insurance claims.A travel agency in Mott Haven.A beauty salon in Morrisania.They're all in the South Bronx.Where a lot of kids learn how to sh**t from watching gangster flicks.Have you ever seen this guy? He's a lawyer, Jack Duvall.No, I don't have much use for lawyers.Well, this lawyer wrote a $9,000 check to JC's Beauty Spa.And that's you, isn't it? I'm Solomon.JC is my wife Jaqueetha.It's her place.She had a gypsy cab, dollar van accident a while back.It could be for that.Why don't we ask Jaqueetha? I want you to soak your hand in this.Is that what it was for? A gypsy cab accident a while back? I whiplashed my neck.That's what it was for.Those guys are crazy drivers.You're lucky they had insurance.Is this your son? Uh-huh.My boy.And there he is again.He must be, what, 14 in that picture? He's grown a lot.You must be what, 16? Nineteen.Taye, why don't you go upstairs, do your studies.We'll let you get back to business.I recognized her first.She testified at the trial of the boy's real father in '87.Dempsey Powers.You would've been in Germany.I remember hearing about him, the South Bronx Drug King.He had an interesting MO.He used to sh**t his victims straight down through the top of their head to destroy the slug so it couldn't be traced back to his g*n.When they came to arrest him, he sh*t his way out.Wounded nine cops.My dad spent the summer visiting hospitals.But that isn't why he's in jail, is it? No, he claimed self-defense.Told the jury the cops were in the drug business with him and were out to k*ll him.They bought it.He's in jail for k*lling three dope dealers.And now the mother of his kid is getting money from Milt Winters' lawyer.You know, it's funny.Two guys who think that the world is after them found each other.Hey look, I was real kind to that old white man.Gave him a cigarette once.Maybe that's why he sent money to Jaqueetha.Yeah, $9000 for a loosey? Hey, it's different economics inside this wall.In fact, uh, what am I getting for this little sit-down? Two extra phone calls a week for six months and an extra hour of TV a day.- Extra TV.- Yeah.Living large, Dempsey.The point is, I'm still living, after all the b*ll*ts the crooked NYPD threw at me.Yeah, well, that was before our time.We were in the South Bronx.We just happened to drop your name.And I got to tell you, there's still all love for DP on the streets.I'm a legend.A living legend.In the South Bronx, but in here you're what, a guardian angel? Is that why Milt Winters had his lawyer send over 200 grand to businesses that belong to your family and friends? Maybe it was reparations for the sl*ve trade.First week Milt was here, some guy tried to shake him down.That guy ended up with a screwdriver in his neck.Milt was never bothered again.Milt carried himself like a man, so he was treated like one.Especially with you watching his back.He ever talk to you about his wife? I would never turn on my friends.I'm not the NYPD.- This punk's a waste of time.- Yeah, but we're just talking.You know, we noticed that your son's only been up here four times in 16 years.Greenhaven's too far.Yeah? Help us out with Milt.Maybe we can talk to the DA.Move you someplace closer where your son can visit.Come on, Dempsey.What do you think? You know what, I'm going to watch some TV.Oh.So you're gonna You're gonna pass up seeing your son to protect some rich white man.Wow! You know, I think you should sit down, make yourself comfortable.I think we're gonna search your cell.You know what? You can search all you want.You can plant all the phony evidence you want.I ain't afraid of you.You got that? I ain't afraid.We found this inside the mattress.It's probably marked.Cards, girlie magazines.Dempsey Powers' entire world, and kids in the projects think he's a living legend.This isn't much worse than what they have.Except he gets three squares a day.He's short four cards.Queen of diamonds.Jack of clubs.Deuce of spades.Ace, hearts.Queen of diamonds, Milt's wife.Jack of clubs, - Jack Duvall.- It's a hit list? Deuce of spades, Milt Junior.- His own son? - He's on a paranoid fugue.He's cleaning house.Like any good paranoiac, he wants to be there when his enemies go down.I don't know, Dad.You call me out of the blue.I've had so much loss these past two weeks.I need you, Son.I need you close to me now.Let me think about it, Dad.I got to go now.- How about a ride uptown? - No, it's okay.The water taxi will get me there quicker.See you, Dad.Son! Clear! I didn't believe them when they told me.You bastard, how could you? / No! No, it's them.These cops are trying to k*ll me.- They're after me.- For once, you're right.We are after you.Milton Winters, you're under arrest.I told you, I'm a bike messenger.People are trying to jack me all the time.- That's why I was carrying the piece.- What about these? We found them in your mom's apartment? Don't know nothing about them.You don't know what this is? Huh? How about this one? - This one? - They're playing cards? No, Ahmal, signals from Dempsey Powers.You see, some Some rich white dude paid him 200 large to have you k*ll these people.You all are whack.And you're an amateur, 'cause pros don't keep evidence in their mama's apartment.I didn't do these homicides, but whoever did, he's no amateur.He's gangster.Gangster? No.This fool was too busy styling to sh**t straight.He punched out b*ll*ts Using a 90 degree flip.Or maybe the modified John Woo 180 cock.Whichever, he had no control.He put more b*ll*ts in the door than he did in this woman.She looked dead in the picture.This isn't a movie.You did a m*rder in the course of a robbery.That's a death penalty.- I didn't rob nobody.- You took an earring off the woman.Didn't Dempsey tell you not to mess with the bling-bling? I'm telling you, I don't even know DP.Your brother Luther spent time with him up in Greenhaven.Is that how you met DP? Visiting your brother up in Greenhaven? How am I gonna get all the way up there? Subway only stop at 241st Street.All right, you don't have to flip on DP.Try this.You have these three cards.We know that there is a fourth, the ace of hearts.Who is it? Who is the fourth hit? I got no ace.I'm done.Give me a lawyer.Even if this boy flips on Dempsey Powers, we have no corroboration other than generic playing cards from a generic deck.I suggest we have a conversation with Mr.Powers.About what? A plea bargain? What else would we talk to him about? We're gonna cut a deal with a guy who sh*t nine cops? He's already serving life with no parole, and he's merely the subcontractor here.Milt Winters is the author of these murders.These are his targets.And am I wrong to assume that unless we identify the fourth target, Milt Winters will find somebody to finish the job? On what planet do you think Powers is going to cooperate with either the police or the DA? He hates us.He doesn't trust us.Dempsey thinks that we're capable of anything.Let's not disappoint him.As you probably know, Milt Winters' lawyer was sh*t outside the DA's office.Not the smartest call.The place was crawling with officers.My partner's old man was in the 40.Same precinct where you sh*t all those cops.You mean, the crooked cops.What's her daddy's name? Maybe he was on my payroll.The officers got a good look at the person who k*lled the lawyer.Recognize him? Oops.That looks just like your son Taye.My son had nothing to do with it.We have the m*rder w*apon.If you think it was easy to plant fingerprints in '87, just think about what we can do now.You're a devil.You should see me in a blue dress.Yeah, well, I ain't afraid of the devil.You should be afraid of my partner, afraid for your son.I give you what you want, you all leave me and my son in peace? I'll make sure we do, you tell the grand jury what you know and testify at Milt's trial.Oh, man.Old Milt may have come to me for some favors.But, you know, being a man of peace, naturally I turned him down.I would, um, be willing to talk about those favors.The ace of hearts, who is it? Milt lost a lot of weight in prison.Got himself healthy.He started thinking that his doctor kept him sick all those years, to bleed him dry.It's the ace of hearts, his heart doctor, Dr.Chang.Dempsey said no such thing.That's a lie.He and I are brothers.Your brother told us who your fourth target is.If you want any leniency from me, you'll call off any attempt on your doctor's life.My doctor? It's a trick.Can't you see? My brother did not betray me, would not betray me, ever.You don't trust your own son, but you trust Dempsey Powers.More now than ever.I've told him for 30 years to lose weight, to exercise.So what does he do in prison? He loses weight.He exercises.So now he wants to k*ll me? You don't sound alarmed by this.Would alarm help? Milt is the one who lives in fear.You mean paranoia? The fear of death.His father d*ed of a heart att*ck at 37.Milt thinks he lives on borrowed time.How old was Milt when his father d*ed? Sixteen.Somehow he kept his father's store going.Right.Somehow.Dr.Chang, we'll assign a couple of detectives to keep an eye on your office in the city.I don't work in the city anymore.Don't live here either.I moved to Staten Island a year ago.I hardly come into the city at all anymore.Does Milt know you spend all your time on Staten Island? / Yes.He even made a donation to the hospice I started there.Okay.Thank you, Doctor.Someone will take you back to the ferry.If bicycle boy wouldn't visit his brother because the subway didn't go to Greenhaven, how did he figure on getting to Staten Island to sh**t the good doctor? It was a delivery in one of these offices over there.I don't know what office you're talking about.You wanted him to tell you where he was making his delivery.That's what he just did, so he's done.You can't just come over here and point it out to me, Ahmal? No, I'm fine right here, man.Wait, are you afraid of the water? I ain't afraid of some water.I just don't I just stay away from it.- Well, you go over bridges, don't you? - I don't take bridges.- What about the ferry? - I just don't go on water, okay? I stay right over here, on the hard land.That's the biggest bunch of nonsense I ever heard.This is your big day.- You're gonna take a ride on the ferry.- No, no, leave me be./ Come on.It's right over here.Come on.Leave me be.No.No, no, no.Please, please.Please, I don't, I swear.I'm gonna pee myself.Please, just don't.Okay.All right.All right, calm down.Ahmal, calm down.Come on.You don't have to take the ferry.Come on.Come on.It's going to be all right.You can stay right here on the hard land.He was supposed to do the hit on Milt's son.He hesitated.He waited for the son to get away from the water's edge.Now, there's no way that he's gonna take a job sh**ting someone on Staten Island.Fourth victim, the ace of hearts, it's not the doctor.Milt's having somebody else k*lled.Dempsey wouldn't lie to us about that.But he would lie to us if he was having someone k*lled.He's playing us.Yeah, he's playing all of us.Milt contracted those three hits.The fourth one is Dempsey's choice.We may be overestimating Mr.Powers' cunning.The idea he used Milt Winters' k*lling spree to hide a k*lling of his own is Overestimate a guy who put nine cops in the hospital? You can't be serious.And cover the personnel at Greenhaven, starting with the warden.Dempsey might have already made his move.I checked homicides going back two months.This one, last week, in Queens.Eduardo Escobar.sh*t once straight down through the top of the head.- Dempsey's MO.- Who the hell is Eduardo Escobar? A subway mechanic.Married last month.No priors, no known connection to Dempsey Powers.If someone k*lled Escobar on orders from Powers, isn't it reckless to advertise the fact by using Powers' calling card? Reckless and bold.The act of someone proud of his connection to Dempsey Powers.I didn't k*ll no Eduardo Escobar.You gonna plant the g*n you're looking for, or just powder burns? Don't believe everything your father tells you.I don't have to tell you anything.My father told me that, too.You keep following his advice, and you'll end up just like him./ Ma! - Downstairs is clean.- You won't find anything.Taye has his father's mouth, but my husband and I raised him right.You got a lot of new books.History of Cuba.Cuba Today.My final essay on parts of the world where police don't practice racism.Definitely his father's mouth.Come on, Taye, let's let them do their work.This kid's inherited more than just his father's mouth.Dempsey does nothing by accident.Spanish, Cuba probably figure into their long-term plans.And k*lling Eduardo Escobar somehow gets them there.No.I never seen this man before.Eduardo had no enemies.He was gentle, always helping people.What about this one? You ever see him? No.Who are they? Just men.This is from Calabria, in the south of Italy.Did you go there for your honeymoon? No.Puerto Rico.We got married there.When did you go to Italy? I went last year.Well, Calabria's pretty rough country.People usually don't go there unless they have family - You don't have family there, do you? - No.So you went with somebody? It was before I met Eduardo.It's got nothing to do with this.Calabrese hardhead.Have you ever heard that expression? When I was a kid, I had a barber who was from Calabria.He told me that the people were very stubborn.He said that when you take something from them, they don't give up until they get it back.Who is he, Ms.Escobar? Tony.Tony Sirvino.He thinks that Eduardo stole me from him.- What does Mr.Sirvino do? - He works for the city.The Department of Correction? Yes.He drives their bus.An escape? / After Dempsey testifies for the grand jury tomorrow.Tony Sirvino's scheduled to drive his bus back to Rikers.Sirvino grew up in the South Bronx.He went to school with Dempsey, and Dempsey keeps tabs on his people.And he had his son k*ll Mr.Escobar as a favor to Mr.Sirvino? - This is - Brilliant.Once Dempsey got the contract from Milt to make these three hits, he orchestrated everything.The checks from the lawyer, the playing cards, everything, to lead us back to him, so we would bring him before the grand jury.He knew he'd be transferred from Greenhaven down to Rikers and driven back and forth to the courthouse.Sirvino helps them escape, and Dempsey's on his way to Cuba with his son.Beyond the reach of extradition.I suddenly have a newfound respect for Mr.Powers.- I ain't afraid of you.- Well, you should be afraid.Using your daddy's MO wasn't very smart.- Blood or no blood - Taye.- he's gonna take it out of your hide.- I'm Winston Malik, your father's lawyer.- Now I'm yours.- Or your mom's.But if you I ain't giving you no reason to k*ll my pops.Taye's invoking his rights.He doesn't have anything more to say.Unless his son cooperates, we have no case against Mr.Powers.And once Mr.Powers finds out we got wind to his escape plan, I doubt he'll testify to the grand jury tomorrow against Milt Winters, and then that case will be gone, too.We haven't told Junior what we know about the escape.We should be able to keep Powers in the dark until after he goes in front of the grand jury.But once we derail his escape, he'll never testify at Milt Winters' trial.We can use his grand jury testimony.Grand jury testimony is not admissible at trial.I need Mr.Powers to appear.I'm betting that Dempsey Powers I'm betting he knows that if he escapes to Cuba, his grand jury testimony can't be used at trial.He never intended to betray Milt.There is an exception, isn't there, that allows a grand jury testimony to be used at trial if the witness has been threatened into recanting his testimony? But who's going to thr*aten Dempsey Powers? His good friend Milt.Question."What did Mr.Winters tell you?" Answer from Mr.Powers."He was always complaining about all of them."His wife, his son, his lawyer." "He wanted to get rid of them." That's what your brother, Dempsey, told the grand jury just a little over an hour ago.- Down the street from here.- Question."Did Mr.Winters solicit your help in dealing with these individuals?" Answer from Mr.Powers."Yes." "He offered to pay me $50,000 each to get them k*lled." / Save your breath.Are you still convinced Mr.Powers is looking out for your interests? More than ever.This doesn't mean squat until he says it at my trial.And no way on earth he rats me out.My son, in a heartbeat, but Dempsey, never! I'm so curious about this unquestioning trust.Is it based on anything? Greenhaven.He looked out for me from day one.You paid for that protection.I was happy to share with him.He had so little.I had so much.The only thing that you had so much of in prison was fear.And Dempsey could smell it.And he used it to gain your trust.I'm not wrong about Dempsey.I know people.And Dempsey knows you.He told us that he was checking you out.He was looking for an in on you.And he found it in an article about a retailing miracle known as Winters Clothing.I I have it.It's here."Faced with his father's unexpected death, "not only kept the family store afloat, "but it turned into the flagship "of the city's most successful chain of men's clothing stores." There was a photo that was in the article.That's what tipped Dempsey off that you had help keeping the store afloat.Your dad's tailor, Morris Swope.Yeah, Uncle Morris.The man who looked out for you when your father d*ed, who showed you the ropes the first time that you were alone against the world.But Dempsey told us that he took one look at that photo and he knew.He knew how to come at you.And it wasn't by being a bully, or a flatterer, but as Morris Swope, the reassuring protector.Dempsey told us that it cracked him up.He pictured you sitting on his knee, like a wooden dummy.He got around your natural suspicion by modeling your one positive adult relationship.He took you for a couple hundred grand and sold you out for immunity and a few extra hours of TV every week.Sure, he's going to spend the rest of his days in relative comfort.But you? You're looking at the death penalty.I mean, that just doesn't seem fair.To be fair, Mr.Winters, I'll settle for life without parole in return for your admission of guilt.You think about it on your way back to Rikers.What's your name? Sirvino.You make these too tight, Sirvino, I'm gonna slap a brutality suit against you.- Milton! They got you.- I'm not sitting near this man.It's okay, Officer, we're old friends.Have a nice ride, gentlemen.The toughest guy in Greenhaven, a rat.Milton, be cool.Be cool.Cool? You spent the morning ratting me out.For what? More TV? That's what friendship's worth? Milt, don't worry, man, don't worry.It ain't gonna happen.I won't testify against you in court, okay? You already did.They playing you, Milton.Just chill out and trust me.Just chill.Sitting on your knee.Very funny, huh? What the hell are you talking about? I don't care what hole they put you in, Dempsey, I'm gonna reach out to you.You're a dead man.You're a dead man.What are you doing? You know what, Milt? I ain't going back to Haven.Just be cool.Be cool.- You're breaking out? - Shut up.Wait.Take Take me with you.We're a team, right? Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.Shut up./ Don't leave me.Dempsey, don't leave me.- Don't leave me behind.- It's a slice, Milton.Okay, okay, okay.Don't sh**t.Don't sh**t.Just put it down.Just put it down.It's empty.It's over.What the hell's going on? Tony Curtis speaks.I told you to keep your mouth shut, fool.We got Milt's death thr*at on tape.Which makes Mr.Powers' grand jury testimony admissible at Mr.Winters' trial.And we've got Mr.Powers for the Escobar k*lling.You know, it's a shame.All this trust and loyalty, look where it gets you.
