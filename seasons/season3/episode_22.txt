02x22 - Judgement, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:39Quite the traumatic experience,isn't it?  Being eaten aliveby your very own sister.  When a man uncovershis deepest desires,  all of his weaknessesare laid bare.  You gave nary a thoughtto the depraved nature  of bringing someone back to life.  Everyone wants to believethat their loved ones  are still alive somewhere.  You hope that they'llsuddenly pop in tomorrow   and say, "Good morning."   By the way...   You said somethingabout a third wish,   but, if I'm not mistaken,you've already made said wish.   You mean...   You wished for Avdolto come back to life!   Hail to you!   No... He's…   Avdol!    Av... dol...    My fingers...   They've crumbled to pieces.   Polnareff!   I blame you for this!   Because of your bumbling, I...   I ended up like this!   Avdol... I...   I made you...   I...   You'll pay for this, Polnareff.   And you'll do it with...   your flesh!   I'll get better if I eat, right?   Right?   Big brother!   What's the matter, brother?   Stay away from me!   Both of you...Please go back to your graves!   Why? You're the onewho brought us back.   The time has come for youto enter your grave!   I was so panickedI forgot to summon Chariot.   How could I've beenso caught up in my wish   that I neglected to use my Stand?   Leave me alone!   Get away from me!   What?   "Please"? Oh no!   You don't have any wishes left!   I've already grantedyour three wishes.   You don't get any more!   Stop it!   Hail to you!   Go ahead. Writhe and screamto your heart's content!   You're in the middle of nowhere.   Your friends by the shorewon't hear you.   No one can save you now!   It's no use. This is the end...   I'm going to die. I'm finished.   Sherry...   Avdol...   I suppose it's what I deserve.   It's only fitting.   Avdol, it's like you said,you d*ed because of my actions.   And so... I've accepted my fate.   What...   My vision must be going.I'm seeing double.   It looks like there are two Avdols.   Of course there's not another one.   If I'm seeing things,guess it means the end is near.   The blood loss is taking its toll...   I'm hallucinating.   All right... This is it.   I'll have to tap out early.   Goodbye, Mr. Joestar,Kakyoin, Jotaro...   I pray for your victory.   As for you, Avdol...   I'll atone in the next world...   What? Impossible!   I was right!I knew I saw another Avdol!   My eyes weren't playing tricks!   Besides the dust and dirt version...   There's another Avdol!   Magician's Red!   But how? He's supposed to be dead!   He was stabbed bythe Hanged Man, Centerfold!   How the hell is he alive?   Tsk.   Mohammed Avdol!   Yes, I am!   Is it really you?   Tsk.   Tsk.   Is it the real you?   Polnareff,you haven't changed in the slightest.   You still lose all common sensewhen it comes to your sister.   No!   You're supposed to be dead!   Hanged Man sunkhis blade into your back,   and Hol Horse put a b*lletbetween your eyes,   k*lling you on the spot!    You're correct about my being sh*t.Right in the forehead...    But because I was stabbedin the back, for a moment,    my face was looking up,and the b*llet only grazed me.    I suppose this is what onewould call a blessing in disguise.    Hol Horse's b*llet broke my skin,scraping my skull.    It didn't reach my brain.It only grazed me.    But I did completelylose consciousness.    So you call yourself Cameoof the Judgement card?    Hell is near, so prepare!    Hell to you!    I know it was only the third wish,but still...    It's really him.    It came true!    JUDGEMENTCAMEO    Mohammed Avdol is indeedalive and well.    I would call this bad news.    Shouldn't you scurry awayto inform Dio    and your fellow Stand usercompatriots about my return?    Well, shouldn't you, Cameo?    That's right! I have to tell them!I have to let them know!    Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, and Jotaro!    This is very surprising news,to be sure.    But I can spin it this way:    Not only did Judgement's Cameoslay the idiot Polnareff.    He also succeededin eliminating Avdol,    who was actually alive!    I can't wait to tell themthe splendid news!    Magician's Red!    Whoa, there.    Avdol!    The Stand... It's far more powerfulthan I expected.    Careful!    It's not just his power.He's got incredible speed, too!    Come now, Avdol,is that the extent of your abilities?    It appears sharing my newswill be even easier than expected.    May fortune...    be with you both!    What?    Hail to you!    Big brother...    No. My Sherry...    Sherry... d*ed.    You're...    nothing but...    a hunk of dirt!    But brother...    Polnareff.    Apologies.    I take back what I saidabout you not changing.    No, you were right.    I'm the one who should apologize.    This battle hasalready been decided.    Avdol!I'd like to hear your three wishes!    Your wish is my command!    Until I put you to restfor good, that is!    Go ahead!You may as well give it a sh*t.    As I said, you get three wishes.    Bastard! He's making fools of us!    Just ignore him, Avdol!    You don't have to make any wishes!    Avdol, are you listening to me?    No good...    I want four wishes!    Wha...    What?    My wishes. Can't you hear?    I wish that I had four wishes.    Tsk.    You can't be serious...    Are you denying my wish?    Cameo, you're the onewho offered them!    I'm going to make sureyou keep your promise!    You still insist uponthis futile contest of power?    Your kicks are nothing!    What?    That's the way! Super!    Tsk.    My first wish was to make youcry out in agony.    And it came true.    This is madness! Your strength!    You're so much stronger!    The laceration the Hanged Manleft on my back...    hasn't completely healed yet.    I was guardingmy wound from as*ault,    and had to hold myself back some.    Wha...    I was finally able to stand againonly three days ago in India.    But since I took a plane here,the trip was rather easy.    That's, Avdol! Still the best!    Now, for my second wish...    I wish for you tocry out in utter terror!    Now for my third wish...    Cry in regret!    That bastard! He's running away!    Wait, damn it! Get back here!    Shh. Polnareff, quiet...    With that kind of power and speed...    given the rule of Stands...    the user must be hidingsomewhere nearby.    Is he here?    He should be hiding outvery close to us.    -Hey, could that be...-Shh!    The Stand useris hiding underground?    Why you!    You're gonna pay...    How dare you use my sister?Time to show you hell!    Hell to you!    Bastard!    I can think ofa few things to drop in...    Like dirt and sand...    A spider...    Ants too...    And a match.    Bastard! I hope you're ready.Your suffering has barely begun!    Hey, Polnareff.    I think I need togo to the bathroom.    Come on! How 'bout it, my friend?    Shall we engage in the timelessritual of male bonding?    Tsk.    Huh?    Somehow I made itout of that mess alive.    Come on, Polnareff!Let me hear you laugh!    Laugh, my friend!    Avdol... It seems likeyou're the one who's changed.    You would've never thoughtof doing something so perverse.    This isn't a result of youbeing sh*t in the head, is it?    That's it! Aim that thing!    Right!    Please forgive me!    Finally, my fourth wish. It's...    to not grant you a single oneof your pitiful wishes.    My magician's Red forgives no one.    Especially you.    Ba-dum-tss!     MAGICIAN'S REDMOHAMMED AVDOL    Hey! You guys'll never believe it!    Guess who I just ran into?    Polnareff!We've been worried about you!    How did you get those injuries?    Was it an enemy?    Who cares about my wounds?    Ready?Now don't be too shocked, Jotaro!    Promise you won't throwyour back out in surprise, Kakyoin!    Who do you think I met out there,Mr. Joestar?    Prepare to be blown away!    Tum-ta-da-da!    Here he is!    That sly bastard Avdolwas still alive!    Doo-do-doo!    Well, we should probably get going.    Here, allow me to help youcarry your luggage.    Hey, Avdol.    How ya been doing?    Avdol, is that wound on your backhealing up all right?    It's fine.I'm still a bit stiff, but...    Hey...    Has it really been two weeks?    -We're lucky to-Hey...    all be alive.    Jotaro, you're stillwearing your uniform?    Don't you ever get hot?    Hey, just hold up a second, guys!    I told you to hold on a second,you assholes!    What's with thoselaissez-faire attitudes?    A man we thought was dead is alive!    How can you just brush it offlike nothing ever happened?    Oh, sorry about that, Polnareff.    When I told youI buried Avdol in India...    I may have lied.    What?    Mr. Joestar and Jotarowere the ones    who tended to the wounds onmy head and back in India.    You assholes have known Avdolwas alive this whole time,    and you didn't tell me?    Kakyoin, you, too?    I only found outthe day after it all happened.    It was imperative to not letthe enemy know.    You have a big mouth,so I suggested...    Sorry, since you cannever tell a lie,    I suggested we keep ita secret from you.    If you'd let the secret slip,    Avdol wouldn't have beenable to recuperate in peace.    We were planning to tell youas soon as we knew he was safe,    but we didn't thinkyou'd run into him first.    Oh, yeah, Avdol!    Your dad's on this island!    Let's tell him you're here!    Oh, that was just me in disguise.    Say what?    Then all that was for show?    Go away!    It's always bad news whensomeone comes to talk to me!    I don't want to hear it!    Avdol's death wasn't your fault.    You didn't have to go that far!    How dare you leave meout of the loop?    Now, now.There's no reason to cry.    I'm sorry.I didn't think you'd be this hurt.    I apologize as well.    But I had a very good reason forcoming to this island in disguise.    Yeah, what?    It was partially so the enemywouldn't find out,    but I also had Avdoldo some shopping for me.    What kind of shopping?    It was a veryconspicuous acquisition.    So I disguised myselfas a wealthy Arab gentleman.    All right, everyone!Let's climb aboard and head out!    Polnareff, cheer up already.Come on.    It's almost here!    What's almost here?    I don't see anything...    What?    A submarine?    That's right! From here on out,we're riding to Egypt in this!    You've gotta be kidding!How'd you afford this?    How about this glistening design?    A submarine, huh...    Perhaps a refreshing whitewould be best.    Hurry up and make some coffee.    I just don't knowwhich one to pick.    Kakyoin, why are youtaking that cup?    Hello? Oh, is that you, Joseph?
