05x37 - Made in Heaven (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 07/14/23 07:44The sun… It's dusk!  This can't be…  It must have started at that moment!  The priest has been executing his abilitysince he was in the Shuttle!  All things are movingat an incredible speed!  Everything in this world,  not only man-made things,but things in nature too!  The sun is already down!  Is this his completed ability?   Where is he?   Where did he go?   I can stop time for five seconds at most.   In just five seconds,I must find him and finish him off.   Time's up.   Time will now start again…   What?   No way. He's using the tree's flexibility!   I will part with this last remark.   Time will accelerate.   I did not obtain this powerto end your lives,   nor does this ability promise mesupreme strength.   This power's purpose is to guidethe human race towards true happiness.   My new Stand, my new ability.   I shall give it a name.   Made in Heaven!   EPISODE   : Made in Heaven ( )   You're being eliminatedfor the future I envision.   Your impending death   is merely a sacrificefor humanity to achieve happiness.   g*n ghost!   It's useless, Emporio.   sh**ting him won't do any good.   No, Jolyne.   I sh*t at the building near us!   Ermes put her sticker on the b*llet.   The b*llet is duplicated!   Emporio, you…   He's coming at us again!   Hold on tight, everyone!   No matter what, don't let go!   It's him! He's chasing us on foot!   My Stand's speed is excludedfrom the time acceleration!   He'll catch up in no time!   Emporio, put a sticker on the next b*lletand sh**t again!   We have to reach the swamp,   to the ocean!   If we're at the ocean,then we might have a chance!   The priest caught up to us!   He's getting ahead to stand in our way!   sh**t another b*llet,and change our direction, Emporio!   It's the ocean!I see the rocks in the swamp!   Aim the next sh*t atthose protruding rocks!   He's coming for us again!   He's simply too fast!   Listen closely.He's moving with accelerated time,   but one Stand is all he's got!   Plus, its combat strengthis above average at best!   He can only att*ck one of us at a time.   That's the key to our victory.   Jotaro, I'll send you a signalthe moment I get att*cked.   Seize that opportunity to stop timeand finish him off!   The moment his att*ck hits me,that's when you stop the time.   Do you understand?   Don't do it before I'm hit,it has to be after.   It'll be a split of a second.   You must be absolutely precise.   Grab him and end his life.   Our only chance is your Star Platinum!   Wait a minute.   We're doing what?   I don't understand.   Smart plan, Anasui.   Although he proclaimedthat you are his first target,   that may not be the case.   It would make most senseif he targeted me first.   No, I've already submerged Diver Downinto your body,   so that it can protect youfrom the inside.   You're not the only one.   Jolyne, Emporio, and Ermes too.   Diver Down has submerged into everyonegiven our close distance.   In other words, no matterwho gets att*cked first,   Diver Down will feel the damage.   What?   You will sense my signalinternally through Diver Down.   Remember, don't stop timeuntil after I'm hit.   Anasui, you're willingto trade your life for his!   That's absurd!   His next att*ck will be deadly!   Maybe so.   But maybe I can signal Jotarobefore the blow kills me?   I've been lucky recently.   Wouldn't you say so, Emporio?   I've been lucky since the jailbreak.At least I haven't d*ed yet!   If I actually live through this,I might even ask Jolyne to marry me!   I'm just saying.   That's fine by me.   That's fine, Anasui.   Ask me to marry you.   I'm not saying thatbecause I'm in despair at our situation.    Your idea carries hope.There's no darkness there.    We may only have one chance.    If there's even a glimpse of hope there,    then I know it's the correct path for us.    There he is!    He's already on that rock! Emporio!    Get close to me!    You need to be closer!    He's coming!    Approaching from the right!    Brace yourselves!    This makes sense. The water gives him awayand tells us his position.    Not yet, Jotaro.    Don't stop time yet.    If you miss him, it's over.    You absolutely have to grab him!    Feel my signal from within.    Oh… wait.    See that? Look at the clouds!    They're zooming by like rockets!    And what exactly is going on?    The sky is brighter to the east!    Why? It's still too early!    It should take two or three minutesfor an hour to pass!    That means it takes    to    minutesfor the night to pass.    I don't believe this!    The sun is risingat an unbelievable speed!    Time is accelerating faster than before!    Around the world, birds are flyingat their normal speed.    Similarly, insects and plantshaven't changed their speed.    Flowers aren't blooming faster,nor are they wilting in an instant.    Look closely.    I have a glass cup in my hand.    When the cup is in my hand,nothing happens to it.    But the moment I let go,    the cup falls faster than we can see.    It's shattered on the groundbefore we realize it.    The only logical explanationis the acceleration of time!    Everything in the universe isaccelerating except for living things!    This is all my assistants' fault!    I'm the top-selling manga artist!    A genius like me drawingno more than one page a night?    That's absurd!    The ink dries beforeI can draw a single line!    What in the world am I supposed to do?    Hello?    What? One artist is stillmeeting deadlines?    Who is he?    Who the hell is he?    It's Rohan Kishibe.    What?    I can't see the wavesbecause of the accelerated time!    We can't tell where he is!    Where will he ambush us from?    Get ready!    Stone Ocean!    Kiss!    Jotaro, hold off on your ability.    Wait for my signal!    Now! Stop the time--    Star Platinum: The World!    You're mine!    Meet your end, Pucchi--    How is this possible?    Pucchi made Jolyne's Standatt*ck Anasui!    I'm one step behind!    Four seconds left.    If I don't k*ll him now,    he'll vanishin the accelerated time again.    It'll be over if time starts again!    I must end this fightbefore time restarts!    Three seconds left.    Two seconds!    Knives, suspended in air!    The priest had already thrown the knives,just as Dio once did!    You were two steps behind.    STAND NAME: Made in HeavenSTAND MASTER: ENRICO PUCCHI    The Joestar family,through their bloodline,    have seized victories bydrawing strength from honor and courage.    However!    Your bloodline is also your weakness.    Jotaro Kujo,your weakness is your daughter.    Dad…    Jolyne…    I stole a car…    on the way home from school…    at a supermarket parking lot…    I stole a car… Why did I do that?    But… I knew that you'd come and save me.    You'd do whatever it takes… to save me…    Dad, you…    I must bring all loose ends to a close.    I do not feel remorse,nor can I let you run freely.    I must settle every matter.    After all, I am the onewho k*lled your mother.    Emporio.    Yes, sh**t.    At least you may die a martyr's death.    Your fate ends here, Emporio!    Jolyne Kujo!    Ah!    Joestar!    Do you think you can escape me?    You swim even slower than you run.    Jolyne!    I caught a dolphin with Stone Ocean.    Yes, time may be accelerating,but living things are unaffected.    Now, Father Pucchi…you're against this speed!    How long will it take for you to catch up?    The distance is at play here.    Had we been closer,you may have been able to catch up.    But how far can you swim?    Is it     meters, or    ?    Can you stay underwater    and swim longer than a dolphinwithout letting out?    Time acceleration doesn't affect    the distance you can swim,or the stamina that you have!    Moreover, can you swim this distanceback to shore without drowning?    You will not escape!    I shall end your life!    I refuse to carry this feudinto the future!    Jolyne, the rope!    Hurry, come to the dolphin!    Emporio…    Because Anasui sacrificed himselfto protect my father,    I'm still alive, though barely.    Because Ermes gave her lifeto att*ck the priest,    I had enough timeto grab onto the dolphin.    When a dolphin lets a human rideon its back,    it swims to shorein the safest way possible.    Hurry, please!    Come!    Why is the rope getting longer?    That dolphin will take you to safety.I know it will.    What are you saying? Hurry and join me!    Emporio, I can't join you.    The priest can sense the Joestar in me.    No matter where I go, I sense him,and he senses me to track me down.    If I'm with you, you can't get away.    Emporio, you have to facethe path that lies ahead alone.    But don't worry.    I know you can finishwhat we set out to do.    Those who wished for your escapewere Anasui, Ermes,    and my father, Jotaro Kujo.    You have to survive. You are our hope.    I told you, I don't understand!    No, you can't…    Stop, wait! Jolyne!    No!    Pull the rope!    He ought to be tired out by now.    I'll hold him off!    Face me, Father Pucchi!    Stone Ocean!    Jolyne!    What's that in the sky?    Could that be the sun?    It's already morning!    The sun isn't round.It looks like it's stretching out!    The needles on my watch vanished…    No, it's ticking so fast,I can't see them with my eyes!    It's night time again.    Morning!    It's night again!    What's happening?    It's accelerating.    Time is accelerating even more!    Oh, damn!    We need canned foods!    Raw foods are rotting away.    Hoard whatever canned food you can find!    We're running out of food!    Dust is collecting!The window frames are rusting!    My implants!    I just got these done the other day!    What is happening to the sky?    Where's the sun?    Is that gleaming light the sun?    Is it night, or is it day?What year are we in?    What is today's date?    I feel cold.    The seasons are changing!    What is that?    The waves are eroding the rocks away!    Is there no way to stoptime from accelerating?    How much more?    Is there an end to this?    The land formation changed!    Where am I?    There are only live organisms here!    I can't breathe…    What the hell? Why are you naked here?    Huh? But I was just…    Hurry up!    Put your jumpsuits on!    Why don't I have clothes on?    Wait… what was I doing?Time got faster and I…    Crap! I'm on camera!    It's going to get misunderstood!    This is…    This place…    I know where this is!    This is Green Dolphin Street Prison!    This is the hallwayby the visitation room!
