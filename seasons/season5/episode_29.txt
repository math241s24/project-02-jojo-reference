I just saw him!Dopp: He was blended into the footage of ten seconds from now that Eulogy showed me!Dopp: It looked like a person had blended into the rocks in the background!Dopp: B-But I can't see him right now!JoJo-main: ,I can't tell where he is by looking directly!Boss: That's Risotto.Boss: He's somehow hiding his appearance.Boss: Could it be...JoJo-main: ,He normally isn't visible, but you can see him because you saw the future.Boss: Look a few seconds into the future to see how he's going to att*ck, Doppio!Dopp: Th-There he is!JoJo-main: ,H-He moved!Dopp: Wh-What?!Dopp: Th-This is awful, Boss!Dopp: In ten seconds, s-scissors are going to c-come out of my throat!Boss: Calm down, Doppio.JoJo-main: ,What you saw wasn't you dying.Boss: Risotto is the assassin that no one in the organization could find.Boss: You should expect a little bit of damage.Boss: You need to see how he's going to att*ck youJoJo-main: ,a few seconds in the future!Dopp: The fact that he gets close to meJoJo-main: ,means that it's definitely not a remote-controlled Stand.Dopp: Th-This footage showing that there'll be scissors inside my throat...Dopp: Does it mean this future is unchangeable, Boss?!Boss: Correct.Boss: Now that you've seen that footage, you're going to have to prepare yourself.Boss: It's true that you're going to have scissors shoved down your throat.Boss: But see through it!JoJo-main: ,See through how he's going to att*ck you!Boss: If you can see through his methods, you'll find his weakness!Boss: And then, get within two meters of himJoJo-main: ,and strike him with Emperor Crimson's arm, Doppio!Dopp: Damn it!Dopp: There you are! Take this!Riso: You're sloppy.Riso: But then again, in all my years of being an assassin,JoJo-main: ,you're the first one to ever land a blow this close to my location.Riso: How truly interesting.Riso: How did you know?Riso: I'm curious about your ability.Riso: But still... you're going to die!Dopp: I-Impossible!Dopp: How did he get the scissors under my skin?Dopp: He hasn't laid a finger on me, and I haven't opened my mouth.Dopp: H-His Stand hasn't even touched me...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,But the scissors are opening on their own!Dopp: A-At this rate, he's going to chop open my throat!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&H&\c&HDCCA&}S{\c&H&}t{\c&H&}a{\c&H&}b{\c&HFAB&}!Dopp: I need to get them out!Riso: Those movements...Riso: I thought I'd be able to slice open his throat,JoJo-main: ,but it's as if he knew I was going to place those scissors there.Riso: He just put his hand to his throat and defended himself.Riso: There's something going on.Riso: I need to be more careful...JoJo-main: ,so I can finish him off completely in my next attempt.Dopp: God damn you!Dopp: Damn it... I couldn't tell.Dopp: The boss is going to be upset with me.Dopp: I still don't know how he's invisible.Dopp: B-But this damage... I-I'm losing strength in my legs...Dopp: Th-That's—Boss: What's the matter, Doppio?Boss: Were you able to see his att*ck?Dopp: B-Boss!Boss: You couldn't see it?JoJo-main: ,Then move away from there immediately.Boss: Figure out exactly where he is by having him chase you!Dopp: Y-You bastard!Dopp: I've made up my mind.JoJo-main: ,I'm definitely going to see through him next time.Dopp: Damn it.JoJo-main: ,I'm going to get within two meters of him, no matter what!Boss: You just saw Emperor Crimson's next footage, didn't you?Boss: What did you see?Boss: I'm asking you a question, Doppio!Boss: What did you see?Dopp: My right foot, Boss.Dopp: For the next move, in a few seconds,JoJo-main: ,it's going to be scissors again.Dopp: It went flying off.Dopp: My foot is going to go flying off.Boss: What did you say, Doppio?!Dopp: H-He's coming! I saw a glimpse of him!Boss: Get away from there right now!Boss: Why didn't you move immediately after seeing the footage, Doppio?Dopp: Risotto Nero, the assassin.Dopp: While his movements are careful, he's already made preparations to k*ll me.Dopp: I can't get my legs to move.JoJo-main: ,I'm not sure if I can run.Dopp: Razor blades, scissors...Dopp: He was preparing for me to lose all this stamina!Boss: sh*t. Doppio won't be able to win now.Boss: It's going to take me at least ten seconds to come out.Boss: This isn't good.Boss: The damage he'd endure from losing his foot would be less than ideal.Boss: I need to minimize the damage somehow.Boss: I'm telling you to move away from there now!Boss: You're going to be k*lled!Dopp: But, Boss, if I may interject...Dopp: That's exactly why I shouldn't move.Dopp: I've used up my stamina.JoJo-main: ,That's why it's easier to tell if I don't move.Dopp: All I've been thinking about is where he was attacking me fromJoJo-main: ,with the razor blades and scissors.Dopp: But I was going about it the wrong way!Dopp: There you are!Dopp: His ability...JoJo-main: ,is to use the iron within a living creature to createJoJo-main: ,iron razor blades within their bodies!Dopp: The fact that this frog and I are so worn out gave me the answer!Dopp: You use your Stand abilityJoJo-main: ,to use the iron within a living creature to create razor blades!Dopp: And given that the razor blades came out of the frog before they came out of me...Dopp: That's the direction you were approaching from!Riso: Th-This bastard...Dopp: Looks like the prediction was correct.JoJo-main: ,Someone's foot went flying off.Dopp: And the mystery behind the enemy's form is slowly becoming apparent, Boss.Dopp: Huh? Boss?Dopp: That's strange. I could've sworn I was holding a phone...Dopp: Where did I drop it?Dopp: I mean, that's a frog...Dopp: Oh, there it is!Dopp: How the heck did I drop it down there?Dopp: It's underneath all these rocks, and now it's covered in sand.Dopp: Oh, jeez. And I need to report to the boss immediately, too...Dopp: D-Did it break?Dopp: Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...Dopp: Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...Dopp: Yes!Dopp: As small as they make electronics these days, I guess they're pretty sturdy!Dopp: Hello? Praise me, Boss. He can't move anymore.Riso: Impossible...Boss: Well done, Doppio.JoJo-main: ,My Doppio...Dopp: Am I going to be the one to finish him off?JoJo-main: ,Or should I wait until you get here, Boss?Boss: I want to make sure that Risotto Nero is finished off for good.Boss: I'll take care of him myself.Boss: Get closer to him, Doppio. Get within two meters of him...Boss: And then, I'll go there.Boss: Until then, get closer to him.Dopp: You got it! I'll get closer to him, Boss!Dopp: Inside the wound where his foot was severed...JoJo-main: ,They're wriggling.Dopp: Risotto's Stand is inside his body!Riso: You have precognitive powers, don't you?Riso: You had a decent idea of what would happen and how I would move.Riso: Otherwise, there's no way you could've predicted my position or my att*ck.Riso: It's true that, at first, you were a beginner who couldn't do anything on your own.Riso: But... who are you right now?Riso: Your personality is now filled with confidence.Riso: And what's that look on your face?Riso: Those eyes don't belong to a young man.Riso: It's as if there are two of you.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HDADCD&\shad}ShinkRiso: Could that be what's going on?Riso: No, that's not it.Riso: There's no doubt about it.Riso: I'm much closer than I realize...Riso: to the one I'm after right now!Riso: Two years.Riso: It's been two years since we wereJoJo-main: ,basically pups who had been collared, shaking in fear.Riso: You're definitely something more than what we've been looking for.Riso: I'm certain of it.Riso: I want to know what you are.Riso: I want to see your true form.Riso: I want to know what you are when I k*ll you... no matter what!Sign: Risotto NeroSign: MetallicPro: Solido Naso... That's probably one of the boss's aliases.Ghia: Otherwise, he wouldn't hide his daughter so quickly.Form: We came all the way here, but it's just a waste of damn time.Form: Damn it.Pesci: But if we're able to get his daughter,JoJo-flashback: ,we might find out who the boss is!Pesci: Right, Bro?Pro: We haven't been able to make a moveJoJo-flashback: ,ever since what happened to Sorbet and Gelato.melone: I wonder who's guarding his daughter.melone: Pericolo's not a Stand user, so maybe it's Polpo.Illu: Then maybe we should head toward Naples and ask him.Riso: Don't get ahead of yourselves.Riso: It's times like these that you should remain calm before doing anything.Riso: I understand how you feel,JoJo-flashback: ,but you need to lock away what happened to Sorbet and Gelato.Riso: Failure equals death.Riso: I'm excited, but...Riso: The one who gets too excited in this situation is the one who dies.Dopp: The foot I chopped off!Dopp: I was right. Risotto Nero...Dopp: I can now see your powers! Magnetism!Dopp: You're controlling your Stand at that distance with magnetism!Dopp: You took control of the iron inside meJoJo-main: ,and made me spit out those razor blades and scissors!Dopp: The way you make yourself disappear is by covering yourself in iron powderDopp: and camouflaging yourself to match the scenery around you!Riso: Correct.Riso: You may have figured out what Metallic is, but it's too late.Riso: Because you are already complete.Riso: Iron.JoJo-main: ,You can find iron anywhere in this world.Riso: Of course, it's in sand,Riso: as well as spring water and plants.Riso: And of course, iron is also found within humans, as well.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HEC&}S{\c&HDEE&}t{\c&HEE&}a{\c&HDED&}b {\c&HEC&}S{\c&HDEE&}t{\c&HEE&}a{\c&HDED&}b {\c&HEC&}S{\c&HDEE&}t{\c&HEE&}a{\c&HDED&}bBoss: What are you doing, Doppio?Boss: You predicted his movements!Boss: I will not allow you to receive further damage!Dopp: Th-This is... B-Boss!Riso: You saw through my ability, and my foot got chopped off.Riso: But you are already complete.Riso: There's nothing you can do about that.Riso: Large amounts of iron can be found inJoJo-main: ,vegetables like spinach and meats like liver.Riso: It's an important substance that's within your bloodstream.Riso: What happens when all the iron within you leaves your body at once?Riso: To put it simply, your blood turns a horrible shade of yellow and you die.Riso: The iron in your blood captures the oxygenJoJo-main: ,that enters your body when you breathe,Riso: and carries it throughout your body.Riso: Without that, the precious oxygen doesn't reach your fingertips or your brain.Riso: Which means, now that you've been robbed of so much iron,JoJo-main: ,despite how hard you're breathing, oxygen isn't entering your body.Riso: Your body is going to become a corpse before you actually die.Riso: Now, then...JoJo-main: ,I wonder what I should do next.Riso: Should I wait until you croak, or...Riso: We seem to be out of time anyway,JoJo-main: ,so should I just go over there and finish you off?Dopp: B-Boss...Dopp: That's...Dopp: They're near the mansion!Dopp: It's Bucciarati!Dopp: He finally showed himself!Dopp: Narancia's also there, and... Abbacchio's there, too!Boss: What? Abbacchio's there?Boss: We're out of time.Boss: Doppio, finish him off with your next move!Boss: Predict Risotto's movements in the footage!Dopp: I'm already looking!Dopp: Risotto will come around my right side, and then...JoJo-main: ,He disappears! I can't see him!Dopp: I-It can't be...Boss: What do you see, Doppio?Boss: What do you see?Dopp: I'm gonna turn the tables, damn it!Dopp: I'll finish him off, Boss!Dopp: A few seconds before what happens in this footage happens...Dopp: I'll blow off his head instead!Dopp: Just like I chopped off his foot earlier!Dopp: H-Here he comes!Boss: Don't do anything else, Doppio!Boss: There's nothing else you can do.Boss: Listen well, Doppio. This is important.Boss: Don't waste any more energy.Boss: I'm heading there right now.Boss: It'll be a few more seconds, but I'll deal with Risotto.Dopp: A few seconds?!JoJo-main: ,But it'll be too late! He's going to att*ck me any second!Boss: Deal with it!Boss: If my full abilities get there,JoJo-main: ,I can just erase the time you saw in the footage!Dopp: But I'm the one who's going to be att*cked!Dopp: So I'll finish him off!Boss: Doppio! This is the only way!Boss: This is the only way you're going to survive!Boss: Your body can't take any more.Boss: I won't allow you to waste any more energy on my behalf!Boss: You're going to finish him off?JoJo-main: ,Risotto Nero is not someone you can find twice!Dopp: But what if I can, Boss?Dopp: If I know where he is...Dopp: If his ability is going to try to steal even more iron from my body...Dopp: H-Here he comes! He's attacking!Dopp: He should have the strength to pull...JoJo-main: ,He should have the strength to pull the iron from my body!Dopp: The scalpel is pointing in the direction of the magnetic force!Dopp: You're right there, Risotto!Riso: I figured that's what you'd do.riso: Magnetism pulls at the iron.Riso: If you can figure out which way it's being pulled,JoJo-main: ,you thought you could figure out my location.Riso: However, unfortunately...Riso: What you sensed wasJoJo-main: ,the magnetism that Metallic is producing in the foot you chopped off.Riso: I left it there.JoJo-main: ,I learned from my mistake of letting you chop off my right foot.Riso: I need to make the best of that situation.Riso: There's barely any oxygen left in your body.Riso: You are complete.Riso: You shouldn't even be able to move an inch.Riso: You're different from before.JoJo-main: ,Now you're brimming with confidence.Riso: The excessive physical changes to your body,Riso: and the way you're talking to yourself...Riso: It all makes sense now.JoJo-main: ,I finally figured out who you really are!Riso: Yes, this had already been confirmed in th century Germany.Riso: There are people in this world who have multiple personalities.Riso: In some cases, it doesn't just affect them mentally.JoJo-main: ,Their body... Their physique can change, as well as their way of speaking.Riso: I had just thought that you were the boss's most trusted subordinate.Riso: But you...JoJo-main: ,To think that you...Riso: I can't wait.JoJo-main: ,I can't what to see what your face will look like once you die!Riso: There's nothing else you can do.Riso: I'm keeping my distance.JoJo-main: ,You have no strength to resist.Riso: There's nothing you can do!Riso: I've won!JoJo-main: ,I'm going to chop off your head!Riso: This is the end! Take this!Riso: Metallic!Riso: Wh-What?Boss: Risotto,JoJo-main: ,I told Doppio...Boss: that you were no longer an enemy he could handle.Riso: Don't tell me...Bruno: I knew it. The enemy was already here.Nara: But I sh*t right through him! I hit him good, too!Riso: Y-You...Boss: If the blood in my body that's been robbed of ironJoJo-main: ,isn't going to carry oxygen throughout my body...Boss: It's the same thing as if my body wasn't breathing.Boss: Which means that the only thing Li'l Bomber can track right now...Bruno: How many enemies are there, Narancia?Nara: Just one!Nara: There's only one person breathing on that cliff!Boss: ...is your breathing, Risotto.Boss: I see.Boss: This is the same thing that happened in the footage that Doppio saw, but...Riso: I was winning...JoJo-main: ,I would've won...Riso: But you had thrown the scalpels at them...Riso: Boss...
