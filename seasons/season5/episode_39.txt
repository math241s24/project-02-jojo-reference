Hurry up and pierce your Stand with this arrow!Mista: What's going on? Requiem's suddenly heading toward us.Dia: Giorno! Stop Requiem!Gio: I can't! It's too far away!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HCCF&\c&HB&}cr*ckTrish: Wha—Trish: My g*n...Dia: What are you doing, Mista?!Mista: It's because you're touching the arrow!Trish: No way! Why is this...Gio: Let go of it, Mr. Polnareff!Gio: Let go of the arrow!Trish: Glad I took that cop's Beretta just in case.Trish: But what the hell, b*ll*ts?Trish: Why'd my revolver break all of a sudden?Five: M-Maybe the boss got close?b*llet: You dumbass! Think before you talk, Number Five!b*llet: Are you saying you saw someone coming close to us in this big, open space?b*llet: We didn't see anyone at the moment the revolver broke.b*llet: It's metal fatigue.JoJo-main: ,It's because he's been overusing the g*n.b*llet: The axis of the cylinder broke.b*llet: We haven't had a chance to doany maintenance or inspections!b*llet: H-Hey!Trish: What the hell is this thing's problem? It's heading toward m-me!Turtle: No, Mista. It's heading towards me.Turtle: Even though it has the arrow back...Gio: Golden Wind!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HCBBC&\c&HEB&}BatoomTurtle: Requiem intends to finish me because I touched the arrow.Gio: Mista, run!Mista: Reload, b*ll*ts! Reload the g*n!b*llet: This isn't a revolver! We need another cartridge!b*llet: It'll take time to reload it!Turtle: I-It's no use...JoJo-main: ,I'm finished...Trish: I'm throwing it! Catch it, Giorno!Trish: I'm gonna throw the turtle to you!Trish: Mr. Polnareff!Trish: You okay, Mr. Polnareff?Mista: He's okay. B-But... how?Turtle: Mista, do you remember what I said back at the Colosseum?Turtle: There's still more to Requiem's ability that I'm not aware of.Turtle: But I'm starting to understand.Turtle: Requiem stopped because the starting time has come.Trish: The starting time?Turtle: Yes.Turtle: It's becauseJoJo-main: ,my body has started to change!Turtle: That's why it stopped trying to k*ll me!Turtle: This is Requiem's true motive, now that it's gone berserk.Turtle: The ability to make beings swap souls,Turtle: meaning the ability that makes them start to change into something else.Turtle: The prelude is over, and the actual piece is now starting to play,JoJo-main: ,so it gave up on k*lling me.Turtle: The .-billion-year history of this world's creatures is starting to changeTurtle: into something else within a matter of hours.Turtle: All of it!King: I see...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,So that's what makes Requiem so truly frightening.King: However...King: Thanks to them, I was able to see it.King: I'm starting to understand the answer.King: I'm close to figuring out how to get that arrow from Requiem!King: I'm realizing the method!Trish: Wh-What the hell is going on?Trish: What's up with this ability?Trish: How far has this damn thing spread?Mista: It doesn't look like they're dying or in pain...Mista: Everyone just has these vacant stares.Mista: But there is this fear of becoming something else.Mista: The fear that, slowly but surely, both my body and my soul are going to disappear.Dia: Trish!Mista: I-I'm fine. But...Turtle: The starting time is imminent.Turtle: It will happen differently for each of us, but it'll start soon,JoJo-main: ,for all of us.Gio: We don't have much time left...JoJo-main: ,That's what you're saying?Mista: Polnareff! This is happening because you brought the arrow!Mista: You said it had the power to defeat the boss,Mista: but instead, you basically ended us!Dia: Stop! This is far beyond anyone's expectations.Dia: It's more important that we find a way to defeat Requiem.King: That's right. Good. Get closer.King: Get closer to Requiem!King: If we get closer, I'll be able to fully see Requiem's secrets, because I'm right here.King: The arrow's power will become mine, and the world will grovel at my feet!Dia: After it!King: Good!Gio: Don't move, Mista!Gio: Trish, Bucciarati! Both of you stay where you are!Gio: Stay right there!Trish: Wha—Gio: I just told you not to move, Mista!Gio: We can catch up to Requiem in a second!Trish: What the hell? Shut up, you dumbass!Mista: My body's disappearing already!Gio: I picked up your revolver.Gio: The one that you said broke a moment ago.Gio: This broken part doesn't match up correctly with the rest of it.Gio: If it just broke due to metal fatigue, they should still fit together.Dia: What are you getting at, Giorno?Gio: Bucciarati, I need you to stay right there, too!Gio: We need to keep a distance from each other!Trish: You dumbass! Requiem is getting away!Trish: The b*ll*ts said it was metal fatigue, so it's metal fatigue!Trish: I have a new Beretta, too!b*llet: The parts aren't matching up because a piece flew off!Gio: That could be...Gio: But it could be something more.Gio: We'll be able to tell as soon as we see this lost piece.Gio: Golden Wind.JoJo-main: ,I gave a part of the g*n life and let it loose.Gio: Moles are basically blind, but their sense of smell is unparalleled.Gio: Looks like it's returned, and it found its lost piece.Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HBE&\c&HEF&}FitTrish: H-Hey, wait a sec!JoJo-main: ,Are you saying someone just used immense force to tear the g*n apart?Trish: Listen up! The b*ll*ts and I are very clear on this!Trish: There's no one who got close to me in this square—Gio: You're exactly right. No one did.Gio: That's why we need to stay apart from each other,JoJo-main: ,because his range is only a few meters!Dia: Giorno, you...Gio: No one got close to Narancia when he was att*cked, either.Gio: No one... other than us.Gio: Mr. Polnareff, if your guess is correct and the boss had two personalities,Gio: then he should be able to get in and out of another's mind freely.Gio: Diavolo has inhabited one of us.Trish: Wha—Gio: If he stays hidden, Trish can't detect his existence.Gio: The reason he's staying hidden nowJoJo-main: ,is because he's waiting for us to obtain the arrow for good.Gio: That's why he also appeared for a brief moment to destroy the g*n.Trish: W-Wait a second!Gio: I know I keep saying this, but stay away from me, Mista!Gio: Stay out of his range!Trish: My g*n was destroyed!Gio: You're the one closest to the g*n.Trish: I-It's...Trish: It's not me!Trish: O-Oh, yeah. When Narancia was att*cked...Trish: The one closest to him was...King: sh*t. I must do something.King: Requiem keeps moving farther away.King: This rookie, Giorno Giovanna...Gio: He's hiding in one of us.Gio: But despite that, we have one advantage.Gio: Diavolo can make Emperor Crimson appear,JoJo-main: ,but he doesn't have complete control of the body he's inhabiting right now.Gio: If he had total controlGio: of the body he's currently inhabiting, he wouldn't just stay quietly hidden.Gio: It's because he can't manifest and move around freelyJoJo-main: ,that we all still live and haven't been eliminated.Gio: In a sense, we have him cornered.Trish: It's the turtle!JoJo-main: ,It was the closest one to my revolver!Trish: Polnareff is the one who's possessed!Gio: That's not possible.Gio: Mr. Polnareff was almost k*lled by Requiem earlier,Gio: because the boss destroyed the revolver.Gio: The boss won't let the body he's inhabiting be put in danger.Gio: Plus...Gio: I only sense one being's life force.Gio: This turtle only has one soul in it.Dia: You can tell that, Giorno?Gio: Only if I can get closer and touch their body.Trish: How can you be so certain?Gio: Life force is a mass.Gio: If I actually touch someone, I can tell how many there are.Gio: There's no other way.JoJo-main: ,I have to touch each one of you and find out.Dia: But how are you going to get closer within Emperor Crimson's range?Gio: I learned how to detect Emperor Crimson from Mr. Polnareff.Gio: The moment the droplets suddenly increase is when time has skipped!Turtle: Correct.Turtle: But whether you can avoid his att*ck or not will be a matter of luck,Turtle: as is whether you'll be able to just barely dodge it.Trish: It's definitely not me.Trish: When Narancia was k*lled, I was the farthest away.Gio: Then I'll check you firstso we can be at ease.Trish: Hey!Trish: Stop right there! Stay away from me!Trish: D-Don't come any closer!Trish: If Diavolo is actually in you, what's going to happen to me?Gio: When Narancia d*ed, his body was empty.Gio: My soul was able to travel from Narancia's body into my own,Gio: but it was empty.Gio: There's no chance that he's possessing me.Trish: Oh, really?Trish: That's just what you're saying.Trish: I have no way of confirming your ability.Trish: Not to mention, Giorno,JoJo-main: ,do you have a way to definitively confirm that you only have one soul?Trish: You can't check yourself with your own ability, can you?Gio: Mista, we can't go after the arrow unless we find out!Trish: Come any closer and I'll blow your limbs off!Dia: Stop!Dia: Check me first, Giorno.Dia: Hurry up and do it!Dia: We're losing more and more time.Dia: Just as you said,JoJo-main: ,depending on how we look at the situation, we have the boss cornered.Turtle: There's no other way.JoJo-main: ,Yes...Turtle: We have to do this right now.Trish: Someone's going to be att*cked...Mista: If we get closer to one another...Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HD&\c&HCFFB&}SliceTrish: Giorno!Mista: It's Mista!JoJo-main: ,He was the one possessed!Mista: Spicy Lady—Dia: No, Trish!Dia: It's you!Dia: He got closer instantly by moving your body closer to him!King: I've been waiting for this moment, my daughter...King: The moment you unleashed your Stand!Who_swapped_with,King: Diagram of swapped soulsBucciarati,Sign: {\pos(.,.)}BucciaratiBucciarati,Sign: {\an\fs\pos(,)}His body has d*ed(which means Doppio has also d*ed)Bucciarati,Sign: {\an\pos(.,.)}Trish            MistaBucciarati,Sign: {\an\fs\pos(.,.)}Diavolo(Emperor Crimsonhad possessed him)Bucciarati,Sign: {\pos(.,)}GiornoBucciarati,Sign: {\an\pos(.,.)}Turtle   PolnareffKing: My daughter...King: If you hadn't revealed your Stand, I might've actually been cornered...Dia: Zipper Man!King: If I can grab the Stand, I can also move the body.King: Now I can at least make this body run.Dia: We're going to be att*cked! Brace yourselves!Dia: He's going to make time leap—Trish: Wha—Turtle: D-Don't tell me...Trish: Why's he running without attacking us?Dia: Through observation, he's already foundDia: a way to get the arrow away from Requiem!Dia: There's no time! That takes priority!Dia: sh**t, Mista!Dia: Don't let him get there first, no matter what!Dia: Stop wasting time!Dia: This isn't the time to hesitate because that's your own body!Trish: That's not it...JoJo-main: ,I've already fired, Bucciarati.Trish: It seems that... I've already fired six sh*ts.Trish: He's running as he makes time leap!Trish: He predicted the course of the b*ll*ts!Dia: After him! If he gets the arrow, we're finished!King: That shadow...JoJo-main: ,The reason no one can touch the arrow...King: If I'm correct...King: When I move, Requiem's shadow moves in the opposite direction from me,JoJo-main: ,despite the location of the sun.King: Which means...King: To that man, it should look like the shadow is stretching toward me.Dia: In Bucciarati's eyes, the shadow is stretching in front of Requiem.Dia: Which means...Dia: This shadow is in different places depending on the viewer!Dia: This is the mystery of Requiem!Dia: This is why it can control everyone's souls!Dia: This thing is the shadow of one's soul.Dia: Requiem itself is the shadow of my soul!Dia: That's why attacking it will mean attacking yourself!Dia: If we can get rid of this shadow, I can get the arrow!King: And...JoJo-main: ,If it has a shadow, then my own light should be somewhere, as well!Dia: He still doesn't have the arrow!Dia: We're rushing in, Mista!Dia: The light is behind my own mind!Dia: He just destroyed something behind his head!Dia: What in the world did he do?King: Now I've got it...King: I, Diavolo, now have the arrow!Gio: If Diavolo found a way to grasp the arrow, we should take advantage of it.Gio: Because the arm he tore off of me and these droplets of blood are all just particles.Gio: Golden Wind shall nowGio: appear!King: These ants!King: What just happened?Gio: This is good, so far.Gio: Let's go...JoJo-main: ,We have to hurry.Dia: Blast the arrow away from him! Don't let him grab it, Mista!Trish: I'm already sh**ting!Trish: They made it through!JoJo-main: ,Despite him predicting their movements, we're still far apart.Trish: He can only knock the ones coming at him out of their trajectory!Trish: The rest of you knock that arrow back and bring it to me, b*ll*ts!bull: H-He'd already thrown...bull: ...a civilian into the air!Bull: He figured out the b*ll*ts would land and returned the arrow to its place!King: The trash ability of an underling...King: There's no way your weak mind can surpass Emperor Crimson's predictions.King: You will not be able to get through.King: You're still just trash.King: I will admit though, Bucciarati,King: your team has made me sweat.King: I never dreamed you would be foolish enough to betray the organization,King: nor did I ever think you'd find out my true identity.King: But the fact that I've been able to figure out this arrow's true power is a blessing!King: It's a gift granted to me by fate because I was able to defeat my past!Trish: I need a*mo, b*ll*ts!b*llet: We told you, Mista!b*llet: It takes time to reload that cartridge!Trish: We're finished!King: Wh-What in the world?Mista: Spicy... Lady...Trish: You didn't deflect Mista's b*ll*ts.Trish: I just made them softer.Trish: The b*ll*ts stretched out like chewing gum and stuck to your hand,Trish: and I had them use their elastic force to return and blow through it.King: Trish... You're still conscious!Trish: I'm going to overcome this.Trish: I'm not going to live in fear and run away from the fateJoJo-main: ,that you've passed on to me.Trish: If it's in my way, I'll just climb over it!Trish: The arrow's flying toward me!Trish: I'm the closest!Trish: He can't get past me!Trish: Even if he predicts where it'll fall and erases time,Trish: I'm still closer to it!King: If only... My daughter,King: if only you hadn't been born...King: Fear truly does come from the past.King: You have genuinely angered me!Gio: What?Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HFD&\c&H&}BooooomKing: You said you'd overcome this, did you not?King: You were right, Trish. Now you can surpass not only the past...King: but their heads.Dia: Trish!
