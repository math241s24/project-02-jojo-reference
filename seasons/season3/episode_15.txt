To avenge my dear son,I shall rip out your insides!  -Hey, Madame!-But I can't let him find  Hol Horse's body.  She's not behind the counter, either.  It'll be even worseif the other three show up.  I have to k*ll them one by one, damn it!  Stay back! Stay away!   Oh Madame, are you here?   I thought I heard some kind of crash.   Is everything okay?   I'm coming in, Madame.   Whoa!   Ow, ow, ow, ow...   Oh no, what happened?   Oh, it's nothing.   Only a tiny fall.Just bruised my hip a bit.   You fell?   You can't be falling now.   And you b*rned your left hand, too.   You're being much, much too careless.   Oh, thank you, dear boy.I'm fine. It's nothing.   No problem, I promise.   Get out!   Who said you could come in here, damn it?   I'll spare you my wrath for now...   But when the time is right,   I'll k*ll you just like I k*lledthat bastard, Hol Horse!   All it takes is just a tiny wound...   I'll turn you intomy very own puppet of Justice!   There we go...Here's your cane.   What's wrong? You're sweating b*ll*ts.   It's nothing. Don't worry about me.   Just go to your room and get some rest.   Well, if you insist.   But are you running this hotelall by yourself?   Don't you have some family around?   Like a son?   Huh? Sorry, did you say something?   Uh, I was just sayingI've gotten used to living alone.   I see...   Sounds lonely to me.   Just think, life with a sonand daughter-in-law...   Your grandkids couldrun around and play in the lobby.   It'd be a little noisy, but...   That's what makes families great!   If you had a son, he'd probablybe older than me, right?   Hey, what's the matter?   Did he move to the big city or something?   No. He passed away.   Oh, I'm so sorry.How terribly insensitive of me...   You're the one who k*lled him,you monster!   I'll slaughter you!   Please, sit down and rest.   I'll give you a nice back rub.   I know how it feels to be alone.   I lost my mom when I was still just a kid.   Ah, those were the good old dayswith Mom...   Tonight,   just think of meas if I'm your own beloved son...   Ask me for anything, all right?   You rotten little brat!   I should just k*ll youright now, you fool!   Wow, you're really tense.   I guess living alonehas been really tough on you.   What's that guy doing here?   Hol Horse? How is he still alive?   That miscreant must havemade his Stand disappear   as soon as it sh*t the b*lletinto his mouth!   That face!   Polnareff! Behind you...   No way! You're Hol Horse!   What are you doing?   Quiet! I'm the mother of Centerfoldwhom you mercilessly m*rder*d!   Chariot!   So, you're the Stand user?   Dare play a part in murdering my boy,   and I'll make sure you pay for it!   Mr. Joestar!   It's too late.   Your trusty friends will neverhear your cries, my dear.   Because...   I've summoned my own allies.   Who the hell are you guys?   Wait, it's you...   You're that dead guy we foundwhen we got to this town...   You're the traveler from India!   We've got zombies!   Behold the terrifying powerof my Stand, Justice!   Stand users can have only one Stand,   but Justice, the fog Stand,   can transform the deadinto my personal army!   It can control hundreds of corpses,even thousands of them!   Aren't you taking this grudgea bit too far?   To think that such a twistedStand user was after us...   This whole god-forsaken town'sgot it in for you!   And if you get a wound,she'll turn you into her puppet...   I need only to give you a little scratch.    It doesn't take much, you know.    Then my Stand, Justice,will take care of the rest!    Get him!    I'm outta here!    Polnareff! Don't leave me here, please!    Oh, shut up! Did you forgetwhat you did to Avdol?    Why should I save you?    You're on your own, pal!    You can't escape, Polnareff!    I'll yank your brain out!    I'll snap your spine in half!    I'll crush your balls till they pop!    My vengeance comes now!    She's psychotic!    How can an old crone like her run so fast?    Take this!    Damn! He ran into the back room!    After him! Break down that door at once!    Just my luck...    This hallway leads down to the basement.    Mr. Joestar and the otherswill never hear me.    I'm too far away from them now!    I don't think those thingscan b*at me, but...    if I get even a single scratch,I'm in trouble.    She'll open up the wound, and control me.    Damn it... Is there no way out?    Of course the windowshave iron bars on them!    sh*t...    I'll hide in this room.    Crap, they broke down the door...    At this rate,I'm going to have to fight them.    I just have to make sureI don't get even a tiny cut.    Now they're coming down the hallway.    They must be checking every room.    Damn it,they're getting closer and closer.    Oh come on...    Did I run into another bathroom?    Why am I always gettingambushed in bathrooms?    Damn it, the toilet is so dirty...    All right, just try it.    But the second you walk in,    my Chariot will chop upfour of you in a single breath.    What?    Now it's totally quiet out there.    Damn zombies... That old hag...    What the hell are they doing?    Aren't they going to break down the door?    What's taking them so long?    Come on, do something, damn it!    They were looking through the keyhole!    What the hell?    sh*t...    The bastard stabbed me in the tongue!    Perfect! You've finally fallenunder my Justice's control!    You shitty little brat!    Now if you don't open that doorand come out,    I'll split your face openas I pull you through the keyhole,    you fool!    Laugh now!    How pitiful, Polnareff.    Very pitiful, indeed!    My son, Centerfold,    d*ed in unimaginable agonythanks to your cowardice.    This isn't even closeto the t*rture you put him through!    Now then... How aboutwe have you clean the bathroom,    Polnareff?    Lick the toiletuntil it sparkles like new.    Don't be shy!    Lick it till it's shiny...    Like this!    Anything but that...    Anything but that!    Oh, God, help me...    Oh, you startled me.    You must learn how to knock, young man...    What can I do for you?    I'm here looking for Polnareff.    And I did knock.    Maybe you didn't hear me    because you were too busydoing something else,    grandma.    JUSTICEENYABA    I'm looking for Polnareff.    Seen him, grandma?    Damn! Now what?    Unlike Polnareff, this Jotaro is clever.    He must be questioning meto see if I cr*ck.    Playing dumb will justmake him more suspicious.    Troublesome brat!    I'll just tell him the truth,    and the moment he turns his back,I'll skewer him with these!    Then he'll be easy pickingsfor my Justice.    Why, yes, I do know.    I know exactly whereMr. Polnareff is, Mr. Jotaro.    Oh?    Crap... Jotaro has no idea.    Even a tiny scratch and it's curtains!    Stay back! Tell Mr. Joestar and Kakyoin!    That hag is the enemy!    He was just here.    He's in the bathroom now, Mr. Jotaro.    Of course he is. Through this door here?    Yes, that's right.    Just go through that door,    and it's the last doorat the end of the hall.    Incompetent fool!You are a child, after all!    Murdering Polnareffwill delight my son's soul!    And spilling your blood, Jotaro,    will send Lord Dio in Egyptinto jubilation!    Oh, right.    I almost forgot...    Oh? What's the matter, grandma?    Trip on something?    That was too close...    That was close.    You shouldn't hold scissors like that...    Good thing you weren't hurt.    You're pretty damn lucky.    Sorry to ask before you even get up,but I have a few more questions.    Why did you just call me Jotaro?    I never told you my name,    and no one has called me by my name.    I find that strange.    Well, come on, tell me.    Maybe it's because I watchedColumbo as a kid,    but it's little details like thatthat keep me up at night.    You're beginning to hurtthis old lady's feelings.    It's the guestbook!    You wrote your name in the guestbook!    It's so dry.    You wrote "Jotaro Kujo."    Oh?    Then I guess you mean this guestbook here?    Yes, that's it!    "Qtaro Kujo"?    "Jotaro" isn't written anywhere.    I was onto you when you said"Joestar" the first time we met.    I told the others not to use my name.    And yet, you know it.Which could only mean...    Cut the crap!    I already knowyou're the Stand user after us, old hag.    What's the matter now?    Aren't you going to show meyour Stand and fight?    You're looking right at it!    My Stand, Justice, always prevails!    All it needs is a scratch!Just a tiny scrape!    You've fallen into my trap, Jotaro!    Polnareff!    Jotaro, it's me, Hol Horse!    Enyaba's Stand is made of fog.    It'll split your wound right openand control you,    like she did with me!    It'll even control corpses!    Can it, Hol Horse!    Can you punch the fog with your fist?    Or cut the fog with your sword?    Or sh**t it with your g*n?    Absolutely futile!    There's nothing you can do,but accept your fate!    It's the biggest, toughest Stand there is!    Our puny Stands are no match for it.    Nothing stands a chance against Justice!    Lovely, keep it coming.    Your fearful praise is music to my ears.    Now I'll control you, too, Jotaro!    Run, Jotaro!She'll put a hole in your leg!    Good grief.    I don't need to run.    Before that old hag takes another breath,    I'll defeat that Stand.    Huh? What was that?    Before I do what?You rotten little sh*t head!    Before I take another breath,is that right?    Well, I'll do that...    I'll do that right...    What...?    Jotaro's Star Platinum issucking in Justice's fog headfirst!    Please stop...    ...and he's holding it in!    He's suffocating that bitch!    Well, now...    Looks like her head is in a bit of a fog.    I'm so angry...!    "What have I been licking"?What's it matter?    What a stupid question!    Cough, cough, the toilet, cough...    Eh? You were licking what, again?    I couldn't hear you very well.    Who cares what it was?    I need to disinfect my tongue.    Just give me the medicine already.    Hm? I thoughtI just heard the word "toilet"...    Actually, I already knew about that.    But I couldn't resistteasing him about this first!    Hey! Jotaro already told you, didn't he?    You shitty old man!    You were messing with me!    Forget the medicine!    All right, all right. I'm sorry.    Come here, and I'll fix you up, Polnareff.    If you don't take care of that,it'll get infected.    Ahem! Toilet. Ahem...    You licked it real good...    Jotaro, Kakyoin! Come on,let's get the hell out of here!    Everyone, come outside.    What on earth?    We step outside the hotel,and this place is...    It's a graveyard.    She used her Stand's fog    to make this graveyard look likethe town and hotel?    So we were talking to the corpsesthat were buried in these graves...    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    You wanna take her with us?Are you serious?    Yeah.    We need to know how many moreStand users are out there,    what their powers are,where in Egypt Dio is hiding...    And what Dio's Stand can do.    Yes, what kind of Stand is it?    If we can get the hag to tell us,    we might finally have the edge we need.    I doubt she'll be willing to sharethat information...    We just need to use Hermit Purple.    I'll project everythingshe's thinking onto a TV screen.    Great idea!    This place doesn't have any TVs,so we'll do it in the next town.    Hol Horse!    You bastard!    That's our car!    Sorry boys,I'm stickin' with Dio, after all.    Catch you later!    Provided you don't diebefore then, that is.    A little advice for y'all!    You better k*ll that old witch pronto!    Or else you'll find outjust how terrifying Dio really is!    See ya!    What the hell does that mean?    Why are you here in front of me?    Lord Dio will never...    They should be able to become smaller.    When I say I'm going to do something...    He just went flying like the other guy!    Oh, God!    You don't need power to k*ll humans...
