02x33 - Set's Alessi, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:46Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  What?  I'm a kid?  Pami!  Are you okay, little boy?  I'll clean those wounds right upand put some medicine on you.  That's impossible!  Chariot!  Pami!   I'm totally outmatched!   -The nice lady's gone...-Pami!   Where'd she go?   She was just here...   She didn't even scream.What did he do to her?   Where is she?   Polnareff!   You said the shampoostings your eyes, right?   Well, since you got some in there...   Let me help you wash it off!   Thoroughly!   My short arms can't reach!   If they were just a little longer,   I could poke his eyes out and run!   So you pulled the plug, huh? Damn!   But...   This way, it'll take even longerfor the water to drain.   It'd take, what,five to ten minutes   before you'd everbe able to breathe?   Give it up!   Time to snuff you out.   How does it feel to beutterly helpless, Polnareff?   What is this?   This shape...This color! It can't be...   You didn't!   No adult would even think of...   This smell... It is!   Foul! You took a sh*t in the tub!   You thought I was helpless,but I still had one in me!   Take that!   How dare you?   Have you no basic human decency?   No hero would ever resortto something so low!   You're a very bad boy! Very bad!   Where is she?   What'd you do to her?   Where is she?   Hey! Where are you? Hey!   Hey!   What do you think I did?   Whoa, there!   We should bothwatch our step, Polnareff.   You might step on her.   What?   It can't be...   No way...This can't be happening...   Oh no...   Anyone who touches my Stand, Set,   will experience time in reverse.   Polnareff, you saw me coming   and jumped out of my shadow,   earning you a few more yearsthan your little friend.   But she touched my shadowfor several seconds.   That's why she's become a fetus!   She's alive for now,   but she'll die soon enoughoutside her mother's womb!   She got what she deservedfor helping the likes of you.   What a fool.   You scum!   Crap! I just...   Uh-oh!   You touched it again!   You're going to get even younger!   This time, perhaps four years oldor so, Polnareff.   Crap!   I have to...   I have to hurry up and b*at him,or the nice lady will...   At this rate, the nice lady will diein a matter of minutes!   I've got to b*atthat freak Alessi fast!   She made me all better.She was so caring...   I have to...   I have to hurry!   Come on!   What do you think you're doing,   running aroundcradling a dying fetus?   I'll turn you into a fetus too!   Oh no! I touched it again!   I'm getting smaller...   Yahoo!   Yes! There's no way I can lose now!   Polnareff! What are you,three years old now?   Soon your intellect will be thatof a three-year-old's, too.   Locking the door won't do any good!   Dammit! The bars aretoo close together.   Even a kid   can't slip through.   Darn!   I can't cut them...   Looks like your Chariot's becomea toddler, too!   Those bars areway too tough for it now.    Chariot's a slowpoke!    Ready or not, here I come!    Lickity-lick!    It's me, Polnareff!    Hm? He's gone...    What?    He's gone! That brat...    Did he somehow slip throughthe bars in the window?    Nice try there!    Damn you, Polnareff...Trying to trick me!    You're trying tofool me into thinking    you slipped through the window.    You must be hiding somewhere,    waiting to get the drop on me.    Not bad.    Quite cunning indeed,for a miserable little sh*t!    Come out, wherever you are...    You're so small now,you could be in that drawer.    He's probably hidingin the bucket or the drawer...    No, he might be hidingin that teddy bear.    Where could he be?I've got a one-in-three chance.    I'll get him with one swing.    I'll cr*ck open his skullwith this axe!    Gotcha! You're in the teddy bear!    Or just maybe you're...    in the grandfather clock!    I guessed wrong!    Then...    Hm, think simple... The bucket!    Huh?    So you are in the bear!    The drawer, then!    Where is he?    Impossible! He's gone!    No... He couldn't have!    The walls, floor,and ceiling are all stone.    Even if they wereone centimeter thick,    Chariot couldn't break through.    And those barsare too narrow for him.    I saw it with my own eyes.    This is insane! Where is he?Where did he go?    Outsmarted by a toddler, eh?    Gulp!    Mister Alessi.    What?    One of the goldfish disappeared...    SETALESSI    I was hiding in the fish t*nkwith a mirror!    Even a kid could figure that out!    And you totally fell for it!    You're as dumb asyou are creepy, Alessi!    A two-year-old Chariotcan still skewer your face!    Bad boy!    -Hey, wait!-Pami!    I'm going to keep attacking youuntil you break your stand's spell!    Bad boy!    Very bad boy!    That little swine!He escaped out the window!    Bad boy!    Jotaro!    Crap! I'm dead meat!    It's Jotaro! What's he doing here?    It's not often you see someonefall out the window    covered in blood...    Stay calm...    The one who stays calmat times like this wins.    Think about it... Jotaro must belooking for the grown-up Polnareff.    He has no clue who I am.    I'll do what I always do.I'll play dumb...    and att*ck himwhen he least expects it!    Ah!    My boss is goingto be so mad at me!    I was cleaning the windowand slipped!    What am I going to do?    I'm going to get inso much trouble!    Hold it right there, bastard!    Ah! Mister!    What was his name?What was it... Um...    Now's my chance! I was waitingfor Polnareff to poke his head out!    I've got you, Jotaro!    Ah! Watch out for his shadow!    I did it! He touched it!I touched his shadow!    No!    Jotaro! Now you're undermy Stand, Set's, spell!    This... Wha...    This is..    Oh, no!    He's turning turn into a kid, too!    Jotaro!    I heard you developed your Stand,Star Platinum only recently.    Which means you weren't able touse your Stand when you were a kid!    Now you're just some ordinary kid!    He's so small!    He looks like a seven-year-old!    I win! Master Dio,I'm gonna k*ll Jotaro!    You'd better give mea damn good reward!    Die, Jotaro!    Whoa! He punched him!And with his little-kid fist!    Good grief.    Don't underestimate mejust 'cause I'm a kid.    Damn! Jotaro could kick asseven as a kid?    I never knew he was that tough!And as a kid...    Mumble... Huh?    You just got off easy.Let's fix that!    Attaboy!    Stand:Set, God of Chaos and Storms    Alessi:    years old, single,    and unfortunate projectile.Out of commission!    Was I dreaming?    It's that boy's earring.    So it really did happen.    For some reason, I couldn't move...    That's right! I couldn't move,but I remember everything.    He devoted himselfto protecting me...    He fought against a grown man!    He had such a braveand heroic heart.    Where did that little boy go?    Where did my little knight go?    Where are you?Where did you go?    What an amazing woman.She was so kind...    So genuine.    That was close...    I'm back to my normal self...I wonder if she's OK.    Um, excuse me...    Did you happen to seea little boy leave my house?    He has silver hair, just like you.    Pardon me for asking,but have we met before?    No... I didn't see any kid.    Let's go, Jotaro.    Come on, hurry up.    Ah... Wait!    Could you be...    That earring...    We've never met before.    There's no way we could have met.    We're travelers,    and we've nevercome this way before.    Now, if you will excuse me,    we have to get to the next town.    So it was a dream.    Keep quiet, Jotaro.    Not a single word.    Oh! Jotaro and Polnareff!    Where have you two been?    Ah, Mr. Joestar and Avdol!    I told you two not to wander offon your own.    Look who's talking!You're the ones who disappeared!    Now, now.Let's get something to eat.    Iggy! And where the hellhave you been?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    Let me clear that away for you.    Thanks.    Finally, a little relief.    That was quite the late breakfastif you ask me.    Yeah...    We're almost to Cairo.    We've got to figure outwhere Dio is hiding.    Oh, Mr. Joestar's...    Will it appear?    I'm not sure.    But we're close, so the resultsshould be more precise.    All right, here we go!    Sir, is something the matter?    We're fine. Go away.    Yes, sir...    Well, old man?Can you see anything?    Just a little longer.    I see something...    There!    We have our final destination!    You're the onewho fell for the scam.    Oh, shut up.    Gambling isjust like relationships.    The one who cries loses.    If he does anythingeven remotely strange...    You can go home if you're scared.    Let's do it! I'll wager my soul!    Good.
