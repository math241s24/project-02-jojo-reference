02x48 - Long Journey Farewell, My FriendsQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 09:01As I expected...  Joseph's blood suits me well.  It feels absolutely perfectin this body,  so much richer and rejuvenatingthan that which came before!  It feels so good...  So incredibly good!  One hundred years ago, this bodybelonged to Jonathan Joestar.  And now, with these very hands,  I have feasted on the bloodof his grandson, Joseph!   And you are the one who hasso thoughtfully led me here, Jotaro.   The Joestar family has always beenan unsightly nuisance to me,   like the roadside excrement leftby some mangy mutt.   In the end,   it appears that the Joestarsare fated to serve me.   Old man...   Old man.   From here on...   No matter what Dio triesto do to my body,   never lose your cool.Never succumb to rage, Jotaro.   Don't worry about me.   It was meant to be.   Could that bethe old man's soul?   Kakyoin solved the secretbehind Dio's Stand.   And I passed it on to you.   If we had all fought Dio togetherin one single moment,   none of us would be alive.   You've learned to movewhile time is frozen.   You have two or three seconds now.   Use that time wisely.   No matter what Dio does,don't lose your head.   It'll only backfire if you loseself-control and att*ck.   Jotaro...   What a journey it's been.   My boy, we had quitethe adventure.   These last fifty days.   We managed to have our fun,didn't we?   Call me crazy,but I've never had more fun in my life.   Was I seeing things?   Hey!   What are you looking at, Jotaro?   You damn bastard.   I've sucked him dry!   Old man, I know you told meto keep my cool.   But he just crossed the line.   There's not a man on earthwho could stay calm after seeing that!   This is the final round!   The World!   Futile!    EPISODE   : LONG JOURNEYFAREWELL, MY FRIENDS    The World! Stop time!   Wry!   One second! Two seconds.   Three seconds! Four...   Five seconds.   Six seconds.   Seven seconds!   I can feel it!I have power to spare!   I can still stop time!   But you, Jotaro,   I know you can't move any longer.   So you gambledon getting me two seconds   before time resumed, huh?   You've miscalculated.   I feel invigorated!   I could sing!   Eight seconds!   I've been immortalfor an entire century,   but I've never felt so good!   The blood of the Joestars surgesthrough my vines!   This is the greatest high knownto man!   Old man,guess you were right.   My temper just got mein a whole mess of trouble.   But you know what?   He still hasn't feltthe full brunt of my rage!   Nine seconds!   I was able to stop timefor nine seconds!   Perhaps this is my limit.   You bastard!   Now to unleashall of my Stand's power!   Jotaro! You mumbled somethingabout being angry.   Is this all you've got?   Futile!   And now, without further ado,the k*lling blow!   This is the ultimate,my final dance with time!   In the next nine seconds,while time is suspended,   you shall die!   The World!   One second.   Two seconds.   Three seconds.   Jotaro had no idea.He didn't understand why Dio   had disappeared amidstthe standstill of time.   Four seconds.   Jotaro gave up pondering.   No matter what Dio's plans,   no matter what att*ckhe attempts to unleash,   Jotaro had only two secondsto respond.   Only two seconds to driveStar Platinum's fists into Dio,   once and for all!    Five seconds.    All I know is that the next timeI see that god damned face,    I'm gonna freakin lose it!    Six seconds.    Bring it, Dio!    Seven seconds.    Take this steam roller!    It's too late!It's impossible escape!    Futile!    Futile!    Eight seconds!    I'll obliterate you!    Nine seconds.    I did it.    It's over.    The World has defeatedStar Platinum!    I am immortal!I am everlasting!    Stand power!    This proves that no one isstronger than me, Dio!    Pathetic humans!I shall rule over all of you forever!    Bow before my wisdom and power!    Ten seconds!    And with that,I can stop time for ten seconds!    Now, then...    I suppose I should inspect Jotaro'slifeless body and drink his blood.    If there's any blood left to savor!    What?    My body's slowing down.    No... I'm not slowing down.    I can't move. No!    My body won't move at all!    Dio!    It's been eleven seconds.    Guess that's your limit.    What?    I stopped time at nine seconds.    And got outfrom beneath that roller.    Good grief.    Now...    It won't take even a secondto finish you off!    Jotaro!    THE WORLDDIO    This can't be happening!You stopped time?    You waited for me to use upmy nine seconds.    How does it feel, Dio?    Having your archenemy tower behind youwhile you stand frozen and helpless?    I guess it's kinda like underwater divingwhile holding your breath.    Your air runs out, you swimto the surface, desperate for air...    And when you finally make itto the water's edge,    ready to take a gulpof that glorious, fresh air,    you feel a tug,and are yanked back down into the deep.    Sound about right?    But I don't feel sorryfor you at all.    Time is moving again.    Compassion is somethingyou'll never get from me.    I have zero sympathyfor your sorry ass.    Then again,k*lling you while you're helpless    would leave a bad tastein my mouth.    How long will it takefor you to heal?    Three seconds? Four seconds?    The second your legsare ready for action,    Star Platinum will smash your headall over the pavement.    Bring it!    If this were the Wild West,this is when the hero would say...    "Draw! You've got one sh*t."    How dare...    he mock me?    Oh... But Jotaro,    at this eleventh hour,    you can't help but uttersuch a human declaration.    You think like a true mortal,cursed with a fleeting life.    A bad taste in your mouth?    Are you afraid you'd regret it?    Your reasoning is as pathetic as    a rat dropping in the cornerof a bathroom stall.    Your foolish honorwill be your demise!    I, on the other hand,think differently.    All I have on my mindis one simple goal.    Just one!    To dominate! Nothing more.    That is my fulfillment!    How I do it...    doesn't matter!    How'd you like a little bloodin your eyes?    I win! Die!    Wha...    What?    Impossible! I'm Dio!    I'm Dio!    When the sun rises,you'll return to dust.    You made one mistake, Dio.    Just one mistake.    You pissed me off.     DIO... THE WORLDANNIHILATED. DECEASED    This is Speed WagonFoundation Car Two.    We're traveling northbound onthe Al-Nil Expressway.    And we've retrieved Dio's remains.    I repeat.We've retrieved Dio's remains.    Dio's body is showingcellular activity.    He must be exposed to sunlightas soon as possible.    Proceed with extreme caution!    Take every precaution necessary.    Roger.    Noriaki Kakyoin is dead.    We are transporting his bodyvia helicopter.    Jean Pierre Polnareffis unconscious.    The medical staff of Car Onehas taken him into their care.    Roger.    Car Two, I have a question...    Why have you placedthe remains of Dio    and Joseph Joestarinto the same car?    Because it's not over.    -Dio borrowed something from us.-Huh?    And we need it back.    I'm afraid I don't follow.    A blood transfusion betweenthe two bodies, can you do it?    Are you suggestingwe transfuse Dio's blood    into Mr. Joestar's corpse?    To bring Mr. Joestar back to life?    Dio drained his bloodonly minutes ago.    Dio's upper half is gone,but we'll take what we can.    I think we can still make it.    Did you hear that? Over.    Roger...    It's impossible!He doesn't have a pulse.    His heart has stopped.    We can't circulate his bloodwithout a working heart!    Impossible?    Just about everythingon this journey has been impossible.    I'm sick of hearing wordslike "impossible" or "futile."    They mean nothing to us.    You said you can do itif his heart's b*ating, right?    Well, you're in luck.    Thanks to Dio,    I've already had some practicewith stopping and starting hearts.    I hear a pulse!    His heart's b*ating!    Hurry! Extract the bloodfrom Dio's corpse    and transfuse it to Joseph!    This just might work!    Look!    His skin is regaining its color!    His lifeless flesh is softeningand filling out!    Brain activity!We have brain activity!    I don't believe it!His vitals are good!    His eyes! He opened his eyes!    We did it! He's back!    Old man?    You're a fool, Jotaro!    Don't freakin tell me...    You've single-handedlyresurrected yours truly!    You bastard!    Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding!Kidding! I'm just kidding!    Just kidding! It was a joke!    I'm sorry!I was just messing with you.    I swear it's me!    Joseph Joestar.Born September   th,     .    Wife's Suzie Q.I collect comics as a hobby!    Who's the leading actressin the      film Tarzan, the Ape Man?    Bo Derek.    Who sang "Eat It",the spoof of "b*at It"?    "Weird Al" Yankovic.    Good grief. I guess it is you.    Only you would knowpointless crap like that.    This is Car Two. It's unbelievable!    Mr. Joestar is awake!    Mr. Joestar has come backfrom the brink!    It's a miracle! Over!    We've taken back what's ours,    Dio.    It's over.     Dio took something from all of us.     For the past hundred years,    he's taken whatever he wanted.    He's taken far too much.     Yeah.Things we can never get back.    The loss is as vast as this planet.    But thanks to their sacrifices,    we stand here today.    Kakyoin.    Iggy.    Avdol.    It's over.    So you're really going backto France, huh, Polnareff?    But your family's gone.     Why don't you come staywith us in New York?    Mister Joestar, they may be gone,but France is my home.    It's filled with my memories.    It's a placeI must always return to.     If you ever need anything, call me.     I'll find you, wherever you may be.    We're gonna miss you.    It sure wasn't easy,    but I had one hell of a time.    Thanks to you guys.    Yeah.    We're a team.We'll always be.    Calling passengersof France International Airlines    Flight    to Paris,    please proceed to Gate   .    See you, you old bastard!    I wish you a long, long life!
