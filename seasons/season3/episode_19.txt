02x19 - Death 13, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:37That piercing noise...  What is this place?  An amusement park?  I've never been here before.  Why in the world am I riding ona Ferris wheel in my pajamas?  Something's wrong.  The desert...  I remember being in the desert  riding through Saudi Arabiaon camel back.   But where are the others?   Did they abandon me?   This isn't making any sense.   There's not a soul anywherein this amusement park,   so why do I hearthe cries of a baby?   Where is it?    This card is...    Death   !   The card's moving!   Kakyoin!   Hey, take it easy!   Stop screaming and shaking the bedlike that girl from The Exorcist.   You're weirding me out.   -Where are we?-Don't ask stupid questions.   Come on, get up already.   After breakfast,we're gonna take to the skies.   Looks like another scorcher.   I had a terrible nightmare.   It was horrifying.   Oh, lay on the details.   I wanna hear all about it!   Thing is, I can't remember.   -I've forgotten it all.-Huh?   Regardless, it was petrifying.   You woke me up,and pulled me out of it.   Wish we could talk more,but we gotta get a move on!   Let's go.   Hurry up and get ready!   There's a cut on my hand.   How'd it get there?    EPISODE   :DEATH   , PART      Jotaro and Mr. Joestar arealready headed to the plane.   Supposedly, we're travelingfive hundred kilometers today.   My dog!   My poor dog is...   dead!   Who would do such a thing?   A dog?   A dog...   I could've sworn I sawa dead dog not too long ago.   Whoever did this is sick,   but there's nothingwe can do about it.   Let's go.   Hey!   Hold on a dang second, Mister.   What exactly do you mean,you "can't sell us the plane now"?   You had no problemtaking my money last night!   You'll get a full refund.   But first we need to seeto a baby with a fever.   -It's    degrees Celsius.-Huh?   We have no doctor here.   We have no choice butto take the baby somewhere else.   Then how aboutthe plane over there?   That one's broken.   What's up? Some kind of argument?   Yeah.   A baby...   I remember hearing a baby's cries.   But where?   The plane will be backtomorrow night.   I can sell it to you after that.   Tomorrow night?   We've got someone's lifeon the line too!   We can't spend two dayspissing around this place!   So you'd rather let that baby die?   Well, I...   Excuse me, I have a suggestion.   We can give the babyto these gentlemen.   They can take itto the doctor on their way.   Uh, nice idea, but...   The Cessna is built to carry four.   But surely there's roomenough for a baby.   I could've swornI just saw it smile.   The baby already has teeth?   You sure about this, lady?   Do you really wannaleave it with them?   Just a minute!We can't do that either!   It's too dangerous for the babyto come with us.   I told themthis would be dangerous.   Hey, just tryand take it easy, Mister Joestar.   No Stand can catch a plane flyinghundreds of kilometers an hour.   We even made surethe plane isn't a Stand.   I'm more worried aboutthe Old Man's flying   than an att*ck from an enemy Stand.   Oh, thank goodness!   What a relief.   But I wonder whose baby was that?   You're not the motherof that child?   Oh no, I found it by the wellthis morning.   From the moment I heardthe baby's crying,    I couldn't help myself.    I felt I had to put himon that plane.    What?    I always get so tiredwhen I get on a plane.    Mister Joestar, sorry, but I thinkI need a thirty-minute cat nap.    Sure.    What is this?    Hey Kakyoin,where the hell are we?    Where's Mr. Joestar and Jotaro?    This is the same dreamI had this morning.    We're inside a dream!    -What? A dream?-Yes.    That's a relief!Just a stupid dream.    You had me worried there.    If it's only a dream,who cares about a dead dog?    Polnareff, you can't be serious!    Dreams are only as scaryas you make them.    -Oh, just try and relax.-No!    How can I when we're havingthe same dream?    I suppose you do have a point.    It is kinda weird.    But in a dreamisn't anything possible?    Oh, boy! Wouldja look at that!    Lucky me!This dreaming thing is great!    See? Think your dream is fun,and it will be!    Listen!    You saw the dog's carcassthis morning!    It must have been dreamingthe same dream as me!    It was k*lled in this dream!    I got this cut on my handwhile in the dream too.    By whom?    By the enemy's Stand, Death   !    The enemy's Stand?    Yes.    I get it, you had a dreamabout Stands!    -Come on, you've got to take it easy.-No!    It wasn't a dream about Stands!    A Stand was in my dream!    That's what I said.    You were having a dreamabout Stands.    You still don't get it, do you?    Lali-ho! Tell me, does it hurtbeing that stupid?    Oh, for the love of...    I'm saying you're slowon the uptake, Polnareff!    It's coming from the dog's wound.    Lali-ho!    This is a dream,and I'm the grim reaper,    -Polnareff!-A megaphone?    What is that thing?    Polnareff, stay on guard!    That fiend is Death   !    Wor--    Come forth, Hierophant Green!    Hierophant, att*ck!    Chario--    Why can't I summon Hierophant?    I can't get Chariotto come out either!    Is it because we're insome kind of twisted dream?    Lali-ho!    It's romantic, wouldn't you agree?Being able to die in a dream!    Lali-ho!    DEATH       Jotaro, do you sense that?    Yeah, clear as day.    Are you stupid?    Surely you know only a Standcan defeat a Stand!    It's time for you to enteryour eternal sleep, Polnareff.    Lali-ho...    Polnareff!    Die!    Polnareff.    Hey, Polnareff, wake up.    Polnareff, seems our littletraveler wet himself.    Hurry up and change his diaper.    Curses! Someone must havewoken the fool.    He's quite lucky.    Lali-ho.I suppose it's no matter.    Even if he wakes up,he won't remember a single thing.    I'll just have to finish himthe next time he falls asleep.    So, Kakyoin,it looks like you get to be first!    Lali-ho!    Hey, Polnareff, you awake yet?    The diaper!    All right, I'm up...    I feel like I had some kindof terrifying nightmare.    But I don't rememberwhat happened at all.    I've completely forgotten...    Once you change the boy's diaper,you can head back to dreamland.    I won't wake you again.    Hold on a second guys!    The kid took a dump in his diaper!    Look!Just look at the size of it!    Well, he is a baby.That's why he wears diapers.    You're kidding me!That's why?    I had no idea!What a vile, disgusting creature!    And he's gotten itall over the place!    Stop yapping and changethe diaper already!    It stinks.    How are you not embarrassed?    Grow up already, will you?    Does this look right to you?    Well, it looks good to me.    Jotaro, hold on to the edge there.    I'm going to try and pin it.    Okay. Like this?    Now hold on to the baby.    Lali-ho!    -Stop it!-Kakyoin, what's wrong?    Hey! What's going on?    Stop it!    Damn it!    I've lost control!    Hey!Don't tell me we're gonna crash?    Stop!    Kakyoin,what's the matter with you?    He was like this this morning!    I don't care, just calm him down!    Old man!Fix the control column!    We're gonna crash!    Kakyoin,pull yourself together, pronto.    We're about to crashbecause of you.    Lali-ho.    Talk about a restless sleeper!    At this rate, you're goingto k*ll yourself and my user.    Your user is that baby?    I don't believe it...    He's only about six months old.    I'm eleven months.Almost a year old!    You should also knowI'm a genius!    I may poop in my diapers,    but I know a helluva lot morethan you idiots!    Lali-ho!    And with that,you've lost your ability to scream!    A Stand within a dream...    I have to find a way to letMr. Joestar and Jotaro know.    What are you doing?    Dammit! Level us out!    Calm down!    "Panic" isn't part of my vocabulary.    Can't you see I'm working on it!    I'm not waking up...    Lali-ho.    No one's going to noticeif you're cutting your arm    with a Kn*fe that's smallerthan my wee-wee.    Besides, you can hurt yourselfall you want in a dream,    but you won't wake up.    As long as you're asleep,    I control every iotaof your precious mind.    Death    infiltrates the mindsof its slumbering victims    when they are attheir most vulnerable.    Damn it. Stop!    What's wrong, old man?    We're crashing!    I'll control it with Hermit Purple!    I did it!    I lifted the planejust in the nick of time!    What a close one...    It would seem we managedto avoid crashing.    That was too close for comfort.    Now then...    What do you say to me k*lling youby crushing that heart of yours?    Then Joestar and the otherswill think you had a heart att*ck.    Die! Kakyoin!    Did you guys see that?    How do you like them apples?    -My flying's not too shabby!-Hey.    What the hell is a palm treedoing all the way out here?    Good grief...    I knew it.    This had to happen!    CAIROABU DHABI    CRASH SITE    This good for now?    Yeah, thanks.    We survived, but...    Kakyoin, what's going on?    You got us into this whole mess,you know.    I'm not sure...    I feel like I just endureda horrible dream.    And when I awoke,I was utterly exhausted.    Something might bewrong with me.    Try and cheer up.It's probably just fatigue.    It's been about a month nowsince we left Japan,    and the enemies haven't let up.    Hey. Looks likethe baby's fever's gone down.    Thank goodnesshe's safe and sound!    If anything were to happen to him,I'd never forgive myself.    Peek-a-boo!    Such an adorable smile!    I don't get what's so funny.You're not even making any jokes.    What an idiot.    Put a sock in it!    This isn't my idea ofa perfect night either!    Hey, Old Man. The radio survived.    What should we do?Should we send out an SOS?    That'll mean Dio can find us, but...    We've got to.Let's call for rescue.    For the baby's sake.    I thought I was feelingtwinges of pain.    I'm bleeding...    Did I cut it when we crashed?    What's this? The cuts form letters.    Baby... Stand?    But how did they...?    What could this mean?It's my handwriting.    I can't remember anything.    Did I do this to myself?    The Kn*fe is free of blood,    and yet the bladeappears to be the culprit.    Could I've really forgottenviolently cutting my own arm?    Damn it!I was told he was clever.    I never thoughthe'd carve letters into his arm    while trying to wake himself.    What was that lookon the baby's face?    He deliberately looked away,the moment my gaze met his!    Baby...    Stand?    Baby... Stand.    Am I really losing my mind?    I'm starting to think...    this baby is a Stand user!    Hey, Kakyoin!    What do you think you're doing?    Come on, that is way too rough.    You could strangle the boy!What's wrong with you?    My apologies...    There, there,everything's all right.    Let's have something to eat.    A little food'llcalm you right down.    Hey, Jotaro.    It looks like Kakyoin'sreally starting to lose it.    There, there, everything's okay.    Will he make it throughthe rest of the trip?    -What do you think about Kakyoin?-Did you see that?    Kakyoin, that's enough. Stop that.    How foolish are you?    He's a Stand user!    Did you cut thatinto your arm yourself?    Am I making things even worse?    Lali-ho!
