02x30 - Bastet's Mariah, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:44Good morning!  How are we feeling today,Mr. Kakyoin?  Well, this new way of lifehas certainly set me on edge.  Any further discomfort?  No.The painkillers must be working.  Good. That's excellent news.  Morning, Kakyoin.  Doctor, these bandages...  How much longerdo I have to keep them on?   I don't have much time.   Kakyoin, you will recover,   but this is nothingto take lightly.   You will need to remain in our carefor a little while longer.   For how long, well, I'm afraid,I'm unable to say.   Oh I'm kidding!   You need time to heal.   But, well, for some reason,   the Speedwagon Foundation doctorsrecently contacted us.   They've asked that we entrustyour care to them.   Though I'm sure their state-of-the-artmedical treatments   will prove effective.   Who exactly are you, anyway?   The Speedwagon Foundationis world-famous.   I can't imagine they'd wantanything to do   with an ordinaryhigh school student.   Let's just say I havea very dependable friend.   Thank you, Mr. Joestar.   I guess it won't be longbefore I see you after all.   Jotaro, Polnareff, Avdol, Iggy...   Hang in there.    EPISODE   : BAST'S MARIAH, PART     Located along the Nilein Southern Egypt   is the city of Luxor.   To the ancient Egyptians,it was the site of Thebes.   And it is here,on the west bank of the Nile,   where the pharaohswere once laid to rest.   Today we call this sacred sitethe Valley of the Kings.   The tomb of the greatTutankhamun lies here,   in the Valley of the Kings.   Wow, this place is full of history.   Apparently,some residents of this area   still dig beneath their houses   in search of treasure withoutpermission from the government.   You think there areany undiscovered   tombs or treasure left?   Perhaps.   Hey, where'd the old man go?   To the bathroom.   He's with Iggy, so the dog willalert him to anything unusual.   Bathroom?   Do you need to go?   If it's a normal bathroom.   It's so arid here,   the crap dries upand turns to dust...   Instead of water,this toilet uses wind?   And there's no toilet paper.   Wait, is this...   some kind of sand bidet?   You wipe your ass... with sand?   Desert sand is sterile.   I think I'll pull a Polnareff   and wait untilwe get back to the hotel.   What's the point of this shack?Might as well go behind a rock.   This is weird even for Egypt.   This makes no sense.   Why is there an electrical outletin the rock?   I wonder what it's for?   There's no electricity here...   It shocked me...   Mr. Joestar, are you all right?   It's time to leave.   Huh? Right...   Got it. I'll be right there.   That scared the living daylightsout of me...   I can't believe it was live.   I guess the cables rununderground?   God only knows.   This place is surreal...   Card of the Goddess BastStand User: Mariah   You know what they say...Curiosity k*lled the cat.   We could make it to Cairoin two days,   but we're all injuredand exhausted.   Why don't we take tonightand tomorrow in Luxor   to recover somewhat?   Sounds good to me.Ever since we got to Egypt,   the enemy Standshave been getting stronger.   We've been winning by a hair.   Hey, Mr. Joestar,is something wrong?   My prosthetic's acting up.   I probably just needto oil the joints.   Hey you! That radio's busted!   That's odd. It's made in Japan,and I just bought it...   It's just static!Turn that thing off!   Mr. Joestar?   Yeah, I suppose we shouldrest up before heading to Cairo.   But don't let your guard down.   All right. Let's find a hotel.   How strange.   Thanks, mister.    Come again!    Hey, now it's working again!    What the...The hammer's so heavy...    What?    The nails! It hurts...    Did you bang your finger withthe hammer or something?    Watch out!    You can't just go throwinghammers around!    Geez...    Mr. Joestar...    Mr. Joestar... Wake up.    Hey, hurry up!    Polnareff won't stop blatheringabout getting breakfast.    Hurry and wake him up, Avdol!    Tell him he's got five minutes!    I thought old people get up early!    Damn smart-aleck. Has no respect...    Tell him I'll be down in a minute.    As you wish.    Did my watch stop?    But you know, Mr. Joestar...    For a man of your age,    your sleeping habitsare quite remarkable.    You're facing the wrong way.    You went to bed facing south,but woke up facing north.    A sign of youthfulness, perhaps?    I'll be downstairs.    Something's strange...Ever since yesterday afternoon...    My hand's still acting up, too.    What's wrong with this chair?It's moving on its own!    Could these floors be slanted?    For such a pricey hotel,it's sure made on the cheap.    Where should we go today?    Karnak was amazing,so I'd say something like that.    It's a little far, but how aboutthe Valley of the Queens?    What do you think you're doing,you old pervert?    Weirdo!    What just happened...    Oh, my. You naughty man.    You need to workon your approach, but...    You're j-u-s-t my t-y-p-e...    Smooch!    Something wrong!Something's really wrong!    Things have been offsince yesterday afternoon!    What?    It's...    It's stuck...    Is metal sticking to me?    Is that why metal objectsare flying toward me!    Has my body...    My body...    has it turned into a magnet?    Ow!    Is this...The work of a Stand?    But why?Why can't I see it?    How could these knives and forksfly at me without a Stand nearby?    Could it be...    Is this because of the socket onthat rock from yesterday?    That shock?    I can't pull free...    Oh, no!This escalator's made of steel!    The magnetic pull is gettingstronger by the minute!    What?    Hey, you!You in the micro-miniskirt!    You've got to help me!    Your chain's wrapped around me!    I'm getting pulled intothe escalator!    Push the emergency stop buttondown below!    Hurry! The chains arepulling me tighter...    This thing's gonna rip offmy hands and feet!    Hey, are you listening?    Have fun, Joseph Joestar.    What? So it's you...    You're the Stand user!    BASTMARIAH    So it's you...    You're the Stand user!    Once you've made contact    with the magnetic fieldof my Stand, Bast,    there's no escape.    Someone!Someone stop the escalator!    That's it!    I'll push the emergencystop button...    With my Hermit Purple!    What? Where's the stop button?    Does this escalator not have one?    Dammit!    This escalator doesn't havean emergency button!    I'm getting pulled in!    My neck!    It's gonna cut off my head!    I'm done for!    -It's gonna sever my head!-Ahem!    -This is it! I'm gonna die!-Mr. Joestar. Ahem!    Hello, Mr. Joestar.    -I'm gonna be decapitated...-Ahem.    ...by the escalator!    The escalator stoppedquite some time ago.    I pushed the emergencystop button.    It's on the side.    All good!    I just finished inspectingthis escalator.    Nothing's wrong!    The emergency buttonworks just fine!    Oh, are you the managerof this hotel?    Could you sign here please?    What's going on, Mr. Joestar?    It's a Stand.An enemy Stand's got me.    My body is like a magnet now...    She turned me into a magnet!Metal sticks to me!    Pull this thing off me!    The magnetic pullkeeps getting stronger...    That's her!That woman is the Stand user!    -What?-We have to stop her!    I have to somehow get rid ofthis insane magnetic pull,    or I won't be able to move!    Let's get Jotaro and Polnareff!They're outside.    What?    -It's... so heavy...-Avdol?    There's no time to get them!    She's getting away!    Mr. Joestar, don't stay! Go!    Right!    I have to get a good look at her!    This is...    She went intothe Ladies' Room.    Now what?    I'm going in.    My life's on the line!    -I have to catch her!-Mr. Joestar?    The old man's still not back?    Yeah, Avdol went to get him,but he's not back, either...    Oh no!    They sneaked off...    to have an amazingmeal without us?    He's just taking his timein the john.    Look, if they don't show upin the next five minutes,    we'll go look for them.    Oh, yeah. The bathroom.You're probably right...    Come to think of it, the bathroomsin this hotel are spotless...    Mr. Joestar,now that we're in here...    Just as I expected.    -We've got a problem on our hands.-Shh!    Shh...    Forgive me, but I haven't a clue...Which one do you think she's in?    She's got amazing legs.    Her legs?    Yes! Look for those legs!    You can't miss them.    We're going to peek?    No.    Nope...    And no again.    Mr. Joestar, here!    Come here! Are these her legs?    Oh, my. You're that handsome fellowfrom before.    You've come looking for me here?    Ooh! Such a filthy man...    Smooch!    It's that hag again!But she was on the second floor!    This isn't good!    We got the wrong person.This is very troubling...    How could you screw that up?    -Avdol, run!-Wai--    Perverts!    I don't deserve this!Polnareff's the one who should be    getting called a pervertin the Ladies' Room!    -Dirty old man!-Disgusting!    Perverts!    How scrumptious!    She's headed that way!    Damn it. How'd she get so far?    After her!    Avdol, I forgot to tell you,    but don't touchany electrical outlets.    No matter where they are!    That's her Stand!    You'll get zapped,and then the magnetism will get you!    I'm afraid I already did,Mr. Joestar.    What? Where?    When I pushed the emergencystop button on the escalator...    There was a socket next to it.It got me!    That little tramp...    Mr. Joestar, could you pleasegive me some space?    I can't run with youstuck to me like this.    You move, Avdol!    What are you talking about?    You're the onewho's running close to me!    Two magnetsnext to each other will...    stick together!    I can't believe she turned meinto a magnet too...    Mr. Joestar, we're in...    ...big trouble, I know!    She's so...    She's so...    ...strong!    My body, too, became a magnet...    We can't help it!We're both in her power now.    What a strong woman!    What should we do? At this rate...    I've never backed downfrom a fight!    I'm just going... to keep on fighting!
