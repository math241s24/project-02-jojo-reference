02x01 - The Man Possessed by an Evil SpiritQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:23: THE CANARY ISLANDS,OFF THE NORTHWEST COAST OF AFRICA  We did it!  Finally, it's ours.Century-old sunken treasure!  All right! Easy now!  Get ahold of yourself!  -Sring it this way...-I know! I know!  -Upsy daisy.-Upsy daisy.  Isn't it kinda long and flatfor a treasure chest?  Hey! Not so high!   Okay, I'm putting it down.   One, two, and three!   All right... Now pry it open already!   Wait. This is bizarre.   It's locked from the inside.   Who the hell cares? Just bust it open!   Hang on! What are these letters?   D-I-O... Dio.   Someone's name?   Does it matter?   The sun'll be down soon.   We won't be able to see a thing out here!   Guess you're right.   Fine, go get the blowtorch.   It's time to meet our fortune!   On a day like any other,   a motorboat was found adriftand abandoned.   The craft was largely undamagedand showed no signs of struggle.   In the galley, three cups of coffeesat half-full.   And...   on deck, an iron chest,its lock melted away,   lay open and empty.   But the chest's unusual,shelter-like chambers   baffled discoverers,   who believed it to haveonce contained a vast treasure.   But interest waned and,   before long, the chest was forgotten.   Jotaro Kujo,    years old,    centimeters tall.   His father, a Japanese nationaland jazz musician,    on tour abroad.    His mother,an American of British descent.   There's no mistake, Jotaro is my son.   His friends at school call him "Jojo."   Seems they combined "Jo"from Jotaro and "jo" from Kujo.   What a stupid name!   So...   How many people has my Jotaro k*lled?   No! Don't say it!    -I don't want to know!-Uh, who said he k*lled anybody?   He was in a fight.    Yep, four punks with nunchucksand knives,   one of whom was a former boxer.   Your son left them withfifteen broken bones.   He really busted their nuts...   I mean, pardon me...he put them in the hospital.   Ma'am, it's your responsibilitythat he learns his lesson!   Yes sir!    But the problem is what happened after.    Here, make some copies and pass it around.   Right away, sir.   He's a strange one, isn't he?   Please, come this way.   Thank you.   Here, it's time to take him home.   Oh, he's already free to go?   Well, we can't keep him forever.    By the way, ma'am,your Japanese is very good.    How long have you lived here?   Twenty years.   No wonder.   Good work, gentlemen.   We've had our hands full lately.   There's even a waiting list for cells.   Your son is just up ahead.   Jotaro!   Jotaro, throw the ball to Mommy!   That's it!   You'll do great at tomorrow's track meet.   Yeah!   Jotaro...   Let's celebrate.What do you want to eat today?   Anything, as long as you're cooking, Mom.   Jotaro...   Jotaro...   Jotaro!   Shut up!   You're freakin annoying, bitch!   Okay!    He's actually a very sweet boy.    He could never do something so terrible.   Hey, Kujo! Rise and shine!   You're free to go. Now get out!   Hey, I said you're free to go!What the hell's wrong with you?   Mom, go home.   I'm gonna be here a while.   I'm being haunted by an evil spirit.   Who knows what he'll make me do next.   It took all I had   to keep this thing in checkduring that fight.   That's why you can'tlet me out of this cell.    For crying out loud...See what I'm talking about, ma'am?    We tell him he can leave, but he refuses.    Forgive my asking,but is your son all right up there?    This isn't a hotel!    Please! Move us to another cell!    He's telling the truth!    -He's got something evil in him!-It's horrible!    I won't commit another crime ever again!    All right, that's enough!    What the hell's that?    But you're behind bars!How'd you get that in here?    I told you.    It's the evil spirit.    The evil spirit brings things to me.    He's still in! He's in! He's in!    He's listening to a boombox    and reading Shonen Jump!    How? This is bad!    -What are we gonna do?-Hold it!    If you still think you can release me,    let me show you how bad things could get,    so you'll have no doubt thatletting me free is a very bad idea.    My g*n!    -How?-We've got trouble!    You didn't see it, did you?My evil spirit...    In that case...    Jotaro!    There's someone behind me.    Not that long ago, it stuck itself to me.    His grandpa, Joseph,has mysterious powers too...    What's happening to my son?    JOTARO KUJO    Dad!    Over here, Dad! Over here!    Holly! Hey, outta my way!    Dad!    Dad!    I'm so glad you're here!    My one and only daughter in trouble?    Give me twenty-four hoursand I'll cross the globe!    Where's Mom?    She made a fuss, not surprisingly...    So I told her I had a littleJoestar Realty to attend to.    Dad...    Holly...    All right, Holly! You can let go now!    No!    It's been forever since you've held me!    Come on...    You're a forty-five-year-old woman!    Oh, now you've done it!I'm going to tickle you!    -Tickle, tickle, tickle...-Hey! Stop that!    Take that and that!    What the hell are you looking at?    -Mama...-Don't look!    I'll take your bag.    By the way, Holly, about Jotaro...    You said it was an evil spirit?    Oh... My poor Jotaro!    I saw it! The policemen couldn't,but I could.    Another arm...    And it grabbed the g*n!    So no one else could see it but you?    Yes...    Jotaro says this spiritcame upon him not long ago.    Has anything strange happened to you?    No, not in the slightest.    Jotaro says he won't leave the celluntil he knows what's going on.    Oh Dad, what are we gonna do?    There, there, sweetheart.    Everything will be just fine.Joseph Joestar is here.    Right.    First, I need to see him...    my grandson, Jotaro!    Too creepy!    He keeps getting more stuff...    And he's violent.    Something heinous is haunting him...    If word of this ever gets out,I'll get canned!    Don't worry.    I'll be taking my grandson home.    "Grandson"?    Hey, what are you doing?    I told you, this is as far as you can go!    -Talk to him from here!-I'll take care of it.    -It's dangerous!-Step aside!    -I can't be held responsible if you...-Leave him to me.    -You...-Come now, you're in the way.    Jotaro! It's grandpa!    He can help!    Just come out with Grandpa.    Come out. We're going home.    Get lost.    I didn't ask for you.    You'll "help"? What can you do for me?    Sorry you came all the way from New York,    but you can't help me, Grandpa.    My prosthetic hand's left pinky!    When did he do that?    Did you catch that? Didn't notice?    That's the evil spirit.    Stay back.    Or you'll lose what little lifeyou have left.    Incredible! I don't believe it...    He was able to pull somethinglike that on me right off the bat...    Of course... I know all aboutJotaro's evil spirit.    But I think experiencerather than explanation    will truly drive the point homefor young Jotaro.    No, he has to learn now    so he'll be ready for whateverdanger he encounters later.    Avdol, your turn.    Say hello to my friend.We met in Egypt three years ago.    His name is Avdol.    Please assist my grandsonout of this cell.    Back off.    Sure, you look tough, but do youreally think I'm the kind of guy    who would take kindlyto a thr*at like that?    Nope, all that does is    make me even more determinedto stay exactly where I belong.    I regret that thingsmay get a bit unpleasant,    enough to where he will want toleave out of his own volition.    That's fine.    Dad, what are you doing?    Hey, we can't have you...    Quiet.    -Yes, sir!-Yes, sir!    That's...    That's right.    Avdol also haswhat you call an "evil spirit."    An evil spirit that Avdolcan control freely!    And its name is...    Magician's Red!    It's hot! Fire! My arm! My arm's burning!    What is this evil spirit?    Kujo's stuck to the wall and can't move.    But how...    But isn't it getting sort of...    How is it that hot?    That's insane! It's way too hot!    So, it's finally shown itself!    And he's so clearly visible. What power.    Why you...    To think he'd be able to manifestits form so clearly!    So you too have an evil spirit.    And Grandpa, you know what it is...    I do.    Mr. Joestar, you asked meto bring out your grandson.    It was my intention to hold back,but with his startling power,    one wrong move and he may end my life.    Shall I stop?    If you prefer that I continue,    I may have to resort toconsiderable force.    And I may end up sendingyour grandson to the hospital.    Fine by me. Give it a whirl.    Yes, sir!    Red Bind!    This is...    It's so hot!    What the hell is happening?    Dad! What are you doing to Jotaro?    Holly, be a good girl and stay quiet.    'Kay?    I can't breathe...    The spirit's going back inside him.    As the heat consumes your breath,it weakens.    Allow me to tell you what it is!    It is an evil spirit, and yet is not.    Jotaro! What you call an evil spirit    is a powerful apparition,created from your own life energy.    What stands next to you, is...    A Stand!    A Stand?    As the famous Aesop fable goes,    the traveler who pulls his cloaktightly in the chill of the wind,    releases it under the heat of the sun.    Care to come out, Jojo?    Whatever.    I'll stay put until I knowI'm not a danger to others.    It's nice to meeta fellow evil-spirit wielder,    but, you know, if you keep this up,    you die.    He destroyed the toilet!    That's destruction of property!    I warned you.    Bastard!    Don't say I didn't warn you!    Hey!    Don't turn your back on me?    Look at me!    Mr. Joestar.    As you can see, he has left his cell.    So...    you got me, eh?    Not exactly.    I had planned to send you to the hospital.    You were more powerfulthan I had expected.    What if I hadn't stoppedmy evil spirit from throwing    this iron bar straight through you?    My Stand is Magician's Red.    It can melt such steel in mid air.    Avdol is just like you.    Proof enough that youneed not study your evil spirit    here in prison any longer.     MAGICIAN'S REDMOHAMMED AVDOL    Oh, thank goodness.    Jotaro finally came out of his cell.    God you're annoying, you bitch.    Okay!    Hey!    How dare you addressyour own mother that way?    And Holly, stop grinning at the boy!    Okay!    Grandpa! Tell me one thing...    Just one thing...    How do you know all this?    Why do you know aboutmy evil spirit, I mean, Stand?    I don't get it.    Of course.    That's why I made the tripfrom New York, after all.    I need to start from the beginning.    This has to do with the Joestar family.    First, take a look at these pictures.    What is this?    That's a hundred-year-old coffinpulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,    off the African coast four years ago.    Coffin?    I did my research, and foundit was on the passenger ship    where my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar,    your great-great grandfather, was k*lled.    Apparently it was emptywhen they discovered it.    But I know what lay inside!    Avdol and I are trying tolocate him as we speak.    Him? Hold on...    You make it sound like it's a person.    Why would you call something    that's been at the bottom ofthe sea for a hundred years "him"?    He's evil incarnate!    And his name is Dio!    Awakened after a century of sleep.    And it's our destiny to fight this man!    Hey, Jotaro?    That face you're makingmakes me think I'm boring you!    This face means that stupid storymakes me speechless, Gramps.    Gramps?    You're Avdol, right?    I don't know who you think you are,    but I can tell you are a pompous prick.    And Old Man, you expect meto listen to that crazy story    and just accept it?    Is it any less believable    than the evil spirits you and I have?    Fair enough.    You'll have to believe us soon enough.    Once you understand how I know Dio,    and why I must pursue him...    Allow me to demonstrate.    It turns out that I too    gained my own "evil spirit"or Stand about a year ago.    What?    What, Old Man?    Let me show you!    This is...    my Stand!    Did you see it?    The thorns from my hand? That is my Stand!    It can reveal far-away visionsand print them on film!    Unfortunately,I've gotta bust a   ,    yen camera    every time I use it!    Sir, is something wrong?    We're fine. Go away.    Right...    The image that's about toappear on this photo,    Jotaro...    will define your very destiny!    What?    Jotaro, Holly, have you twoever taken a close look    at the back of your necks?    What are you talking about?    You've probably never noticed.    On the back of my neckis a mark like a star.    What the hell does all this mean?    According to my mother,my father had it too.    He d*ed when I was young.    Seems all those withJoestar blood have this mark.    So, Old Man,what's gonna show up on that photo.    The star that escaped your noticeis our destiny!    -Dad...-Don't mess with me!    Show me the damn photo!    Dio!    My spirit photography bareshis image every time!    Take a look at the back of his neck!    Below this bastard scum's neck,    is the body of my grandfather,Jonathan Joestar!    One hundred years ago, a mysteriousincident unfolded on the Atlantic.    From what Granny Erina told meabout my grandfather's death,    Dio must have survived by taking his body!     But one thing's for certain:     He's hiding somewhere, plotting something!    It's been four years since he was revived.    My spirit photography, your evil spirit,     have all appeared within this past year...     It has to be Dio!     "Normal" people would deemour abilities as supernatural.    I've had this Stand since birth.     But yours and your grandfather's abilities     share an invisible link with Dio,Jonathan's body.    Undoubtedly, Dio has awakenedyour dormant abilities.     Avdol, where is he?Can you tell from the photo?     I cannot.The background is barely visible.    As I thought.    I will examine this.    Please.    Oh, Holly.    Forgive Daddy for all the scary talk.    Now, let's go home.    Yes...    We'll be staying in Japan for a while.    Thank you for putting us up.     Of course, Dad.     Let's go, Jotaro.    Again...    Just now, it felt as thoughsomeone was watching me.    It has to be Jonathan's descendants...    This body is sending some kind ofsignal to his offspring.    Very well. It must be fate...    A fate that must be annihilated,a destiny that must be erased.    My intervention begins now.    Jotaro!    Here, a goodbye kiss.    -You bitch...-I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.    I just transferred here yesterday.    Does this look like a pen to you?    The loser is the evil one.    The one who'll be the judge is...
02x02 - Who Will Be the Judge!?QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:24Previously on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Come out. We're going home.  Get lost.  I didn't ask for you.  You'll "help"?  Say hello to my friend.We met in Egypt three years ago.  His name is Avdol.  Red Bind!  This is...   Allow me to tell you what it is!   It is an evil spirit, yet it is not.   Jotaro! What you call an evil spirit   is a powerful apparition,created from your own life energy.   What stands next to you, is...   a Stand!

You forgot something!   Goodness...   Here, a goodbye kiss.   Smooch.   Annoying bitch...   Quit being so freakin clingy, will ya?   Okay! Have a good day!   Good grief...   Hey, it's Jojo.   What? Jojo?   You're right! It's Jojo!   -Jojo!-Jojo!   Good morning, Jojo.   -Jojo!-Good morning, Jojo.   Jojo, what were you doingtaking four days off from school?   Hey!   Just what do you think you're doing?   He doesn't like you like that! Back off!   What's your problem, ugly?   Shut up, no-boobs.   -Ugly.-No-boobs.   Shut up! You're pissing me off!   He actually spoke to me!   No, he spoke to me!   Jojo, wait!   Wait for us!   -Jojo!-Jojo!   What?   -Jojo!-Jojo!   The branches...   Jojo!   Oh, no!   Jojo fell down the steps!   Oh, but he's still moving!   Thank God the branches broke his fall!   Did a branch just slice open my knee?   No...   It was there before the fall!   That's why I missed the step. I know it.   But...   Jojo!   Are you all right?   Oh?   I see his Stand has great power.   No wonder...   the Master wants him dead.   No matter...   He is no match for my Stand.    EPISODE TWO:WHO WILL BE THE JUDGE?    You really scared me.    -Are you okay, Jojo?-Are you okay, Jojo?   That was lucky.   Fifteen centimeters more,and you'd have hit the pavement.   People slip on these steps all the time.   From now on, we'd betterhold hands going down, Jojo.   You...   Your left leg appears to be bleeding.   Here, you can use this handkerchiefto clean yourself up.   Are you all right?   I'll be just fine.   Hold it.   Thanks.   I don't recognize you.Do you go to this school?   Noriaki Kakyoin.   I just transferred here yesterday.   Nice to meet you.    -Huh...-Huhâ¦    So he's Kakyoin, huh? He's kinda cute.    Really?    I like Jojo more.    -Me, too.-Me, too.    -What?-What are you talking about?    -Give it up.-I'm the best for Jojo.    Back then, I was weak...    I had no body.    If I hadn't stolen Jonathan Joestar's...    If it hadn't been for his energy,negligiable as it was,    I couldn't have survived that century    at the bottom of the sea.    But this body is an expression ofthe bond between parent and child.    It seems to tie me toJonathan's descendants.    They know of my presence.    Jonathan's body has given mea new power...    The Stand!    It reaches out tothe flesh of his progeny.    Alas, with it come advantagesand disadvantages.    They are two sides ofthe same coin. Such is life.    I must eliminate them...    The Joestar clan must be exterminated.    Damnit, this room is so cramped!    This is why I hate Japan.    Avdol, how can you stand this?    I find it quite fascinating...    the "Way of Tea."    "Way of Tea", my ass.    Instant coffee will do just fine!    Speaking of Dio...    Mr. Joestar, as long aswe can sense his existence,    we must assume he can sense ours.    Indeed.    But if we don't know his next move,or even what his powers may be...    Japanese coffee is awful!    It's from America.    Jojo, how did you get that cut?    Don't tell me. You got intoanother fight, didn't you?    And take off that hat!    It's rude!    For pity's sake...    Come on Doc, has Jojoever gotten hurt in a fight?    Yeah, think about it.    Yeah!    I suppose you're right.    Okay, I'll believe you fell down,your grace.    Hey, hold on.    What are you going to do?    I'm going to cut off your pants.    Quit joking around.    Well, I can't treat you otherwise.    I'll take them off.    You'll ruin a perfectly goodpair of paints.    Who knew you were such a cheapskate.    And while Jojo does that,    I'll take your temperaturesso I can prove you're faking.    No, we've got colds.    Let us go home early.    Nope!    Whoops.    What is this?     JOTARO KUJO, TODAY, YOU DIE AT THE HANDOF MY STAND! NORIAKI KAKYOIN    Kakyoin?    Hey... Doctor!    What are you doing?    Can't you see?    I'm shaking out thermometer for you.    Thermometer? Doc...    Doc, that's a pen!    A pen? A pen you say?    Does this look like a pen to you?    What imbeciles you boys are!    You actually thinkthis thermometer is a pen?    Why don't you take...    a closer...    look!    She's...    NORIAKI KAKYOIN    My eye! My eye!    Jojo...    You aren't going to tell me    this looks like a pen, too, are you?    This upper body strength...    She's no ordinary nurse.    I saw something weirdcrawl up from the floor.    Was it a Stand?    Noriaki Kakyoin...    Did he cut my leg on the stairs, too?    Bingo.    You're...    So we meet again.    I've attached my Stand to the doctor.    She is under my control now.    att*ck my Stand,and you'll injure her, Jojo.    You bastard... Who the hell are you?    I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.    My Stand's name is Hierophant Green.    And while I am human,I pledged my loyalty to him...    Which is why...    I have to k*ll you!    I'm not letting you harm her.    Now that I've dragged it out... I seeâ¦    it's nothing more thana pathetic parasite.    Kakyoin, this your Stand?    Kinda reminds me ofa fat, shiny, green melon.    You're going to regretdragging that out of her, Jojo.    Cut the bravado.    From the looks of your forehead,    I'm about to smash    two melons at once.    For now, I'm gonna keepa grip on you for a bit.    I'll take you to the Old Man.    I'm sure he'll be pleased to meet you...    Besides, I'd like to know moreabout Dio myself.    What?    What's this green stuff drippingfrom his Stand's hands?    I already told you, Jojo...    You will regret this.    Get ready for my Stand,Hierophant Green's...    Enough foul play!    Emerald Splash!    What do you think?    Emerald Splash...    What you thought was green ooze,    is the destructive energyHierophant Green controls!    It pierced your Stand's chest.    So you must be bleeding internally.    You and that nurse...    What?    But how? I pulled the Stand out of her...    I told you...    Attacking Hierophant hurts her.    My Stand can travel farther than yours,    though it prefers closed-in spaces.    It particularly enjoys hiding from sight.    Pull it out, however,and you'll witness its wrath.    That's why it tore her throat to shreds.    It's your fault, Jojo!    You're responsible!    It's all because of you, Jojo!    This is your doing!    If you would have just let me k*ll you,    she would be perfectly fine now.    You're trying to stand up?    How sad...    You look like a sorry punching bag,    awaiting your next thrashing.    It's true: I, Jotaro Kujo,have been called a delinquent.    And it's true that I tend to b*atthe crap out my opponents.    Some are still in the hospital.    I've also put cocky teachersin their places,    so much so that some never come back.    And I make it a policyto stiff restaurants    that serve crappy, over-priced food.    But...    even a guy like me...    can spot evil when he see's it.    Evil is when you usethe weak for your own gain,    and then stomp on them when it's over.    And that's what you've done.    To a young lady, even!    Your Stand hides from its victimsand the law. But...    I will be your judge!    Evil?    You have it all wrong.    The loser is evil.    The victor is righteous.    Whoever survives to tell the tale!    The end justifies the means!    The loser is the evil one.    And now, the final blow!    What? The loser is the evil one?    Emerald Splash!    Well, in that case...    What?    Impossible!He deflected my Emerald Splash!    ...let's see just how evil you are!    The judge will be...    my Stand!    What power...    You caught me off guard back there.    I'm glad my Stand's strong,    but I get the sense it's growingmore and more savage by the day.    That was close.    A little tender loving care,and the Doc should be as good as new.    What was that? A gas expl*si*n?    It came from the nurse's office!    Everyone stay put!    They can take over from here.    I'm taking the day off.    This guy has some explaining to do.About Dio...     HIEROPHANT GREENNORIAKI KAKYOIN    At this very moment, my Jotaro mustbe thinking about me at school!    It must be that psychic connectionbetween mother and son.    It's not.    Jotaro!    What about school? And who is that?    He's covered in blood!    Did you...    Stay out of this.    Where's the Old Man?    And why does this househave to be so freakin big?    I think your grandfather'sin the tea room, with Avdol.    Oh, Jotaro...    You never want to talk to me anymore.    I...    worry about you so much.    But I can see right through you!    Deep down, you're a sweet boy.    -Hey.-Yes?    You're looking a little pale today.    You okay?    Yay! Fine, thank you!    I knew it.    It doesn't look good. It's too late.    We can't save him.    I give him a few days.    Jotaro, it's not your fault.    Look.    Do you know why he choseto obey Dio, even to k*ll?    The culprit...    is here!    The hell?    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    This isn't good at all... At this rateâ¦    Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.    I don't really understand, either.    This is the one thing I feared most!    Tell me how we should deal with this!
02x03 - The Curse of DIOQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:24EPISODE THREE:THE CURSE OF DIO   It's too late.  We can't save him.  He has only a few days left.  Jotaro, this isn't your fault.  Behold.  The real reason this manswore loyalty to Dio,  and came here to k*ll you  lies before our eyes,   here!   What the... That wriggling pieceof flesh looks like a spider.   So that's why he became Dio's minion?   It is a "flesh bud,"made of Dio's own cells.   And it extends all the way tothe young man's brain.   This modest-sized flesh bud   exerts power over his entire psyche.   In other words, the flesh budfunctions to elicit emotion,   like an antenna that channels...   Dio's charisma!   The kind of charisma that drivesa man to follow a dictator,   to put his faith intoa nefarious cult leader.   This boy idolized Dio and sworehis loyalty to him in the process!   Dio uses his charisma,   his intoxicating charm,to overwhelm and control.   It's how he ordered Kakyoin to k*ll us.   So slice him open and pull it out.   The brain is too delicate.   If he so much as flinches,we'll cause irreparable damage.   Jojo.   You must listen to me now.About four months ago, in Cairo,   I too met Dio!   I am a fortune teller by trade,   and I had just returned to my shopin Khan Khalili when,   under a full moon,   I saw him...   standing quietly atop the stairsto my shop's second floor,   with eyes so cold it felt as ifhe was piercing my heart.   His hair looked like spun gold,   his skin, alabaster, almost transparent.   Most of all, he emanated a strange,almost inhuman sensuality.   I had heard about him fromMr. Joestar, so I knew at once.   It was was Dio, back fromthe depths of the Atlantic!   I've heard you have a unique ability,   something ordinary humans do not.   It would please me greatly   if you could grant mea small demonstration.   That's when the terror sunk in.   His words had managed to calm my soul.   They were imbued witha dangerous sweetness.   It was horrifying!   Come, Avdol...   I ran for my life.   I didn't dare fight him.   I was lucky.   Had Mr. Joestar not warned me,   had I not been able tojump out that window   and fall into a maze of familiar streets,   escaping with my life,   I would have ended up like this young man,   a pawn of Dio,dominated by another flesh bud.   And, like the boy,you'd have d*ed in a few years,   your brain devoured.   d*ed?   Not so fast.   Kakyoin's...   still alive!   I'll pull that thing out with my Stand!   Wait, Jotaro!   Back off, old man!   I'll pull it out fast,with no damage to his brain.   My Stand has the speed and accuracyto grab a b*llet mid-flight.   Don't! That flesh bud is alive!   There's a reason why part of itis outside the skin.   The same reason why evena skilled surgeon can't remove it!   -sh*t!-The flesh sh*t out a tentacle!   Curses! Let go of it, Jojo!   It'll infiltrate the brain ofanyone who tries to remove it!   You...   Stay still, Kakyoin.One mistake, and you're a dead man.   Let go now, Jojo! It's reached your face!   Wait, Avdol!   This is my grandsonwe're talking about here.   His body may be under siege,   but he'll remain cool as a cucumber.   He and his stand are solid as a rock!   He's more powerfuland precise than a machine!   He did it!   Overdrive!   Why?   Why did you risk your own life to save me?   Well...   Can't say I really know why myself.   Your mother seesright through you, Jotaro.   FIRST AID KIT   There ya go.   Thank you...very much.   Kakyoin, wasn't it?   I think you're overdue for some rest.   Why don't you stay with us tonight?    Papa, go get his futon ready.    Huh? Why me?    I've never even liked the ideaof sleeping on the floor!    Holly, get that futon out ofmy room and give me a real bed!    Papa, you're in Japan,    you should get accustomed tothe Japanese way of life.    Oh, and call me "Seiko."    What?    My friends here think my name is "Holy,"    so they call me "Seiko" for "holy child."    What in the hell?    "Holly" is the beautiful nameI gave my beautiful da...    From now on, I won't answerunless you call me "Seiko."    Holly!    Does it hurt, Kakyoin?    I'm fine.    Holly!    -Good grief...-All right...    Kakyoin, take off your uniform.    -Huh?-Come on, now.    Holly!    Hmph.    Holly! Hey, Holly.    Hey, where are you?    Look at these! These are Jotaro's pants!    Where are mine?    They fit fine, but look at them!I can't wear these!    Hey, Holly!    Oh, I'm supposed to call her "Seiko"    or she won't respond?    No, my daughter is Holly.Holly! Answer me!    This time I'm really gonna do it.I'm going to school.    Weird...    Here, a goodbye kiss.    Smooch.    That's usually how it plays out...    Ms...    Ms. Holly!    Ms. Holly!    She's burning up with a fever...    An illness?    No... It can't be!    Forgive me...    How can this be?    It's transparent...    It's a Stand!    Ms. Holly has gained a Stand as well!     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    Ms. Holly has a Stand, too.    But this high fever...The Stand is hurting her.    We were so relieved Dio's body    had only affected Jojo and Mr. Joestar!    We thought Ms. Hollyhad escaped unscathed,    but we were just deluding ourselves.    This was inevitable.    With Joestar blood in her veins,    Dio's influence is unescapable.    But...    a Stand is guided byits user's fighting spirit.    A Stand is called to actionby one's battle instinct.    The kind and gentle Ms. Hollyis helpless against Dio's curse.    She doesn't have the strengthto control her Stand.    Instead, her Stand is actingagainst her, crippling her!    This is an emergency. At this rate...    She'll die!    She'll be overcome!    A Stand...    Holly...    My worst fear has come true!    My girl, she has a Stand...    I knew she didn't havethe power to resist.    I knew she didn't havethe strength to deny Dio's soul.    Tell me! What can we do?    There's one thing.    We must find Dio!    We must k*ll Dio and break the curse!    That's our only option!    But...    no matter how many times I try,he's always hiding in the darkness.    The background is always dark!    My pictures never reveal his whereabouts!    We've used every means to no avail.    The darkness is impenetrable.    Well, why didn't you say so?    I have a feelingit might just be able to...    find the bastard!    Seems it found something behind Dio.    Don't forget, my Stand can    move accurately enough to removea flesh bud from the brain,    and catch b*ll*ts in mid-air.    Let's have it sketch what it sees.    A fly! A fly was in the photo!    But a fly can't help us!    Wait a moment!    -I know this species!-What?    Jojo, do you have an encyclopedia?    -The library's out back.-Give me the sketch.    I'll be back.    Holly!    Papa, I...    Just rest. Jotaro, water,get me some water.    You seem to have recovered.    My apologies, but I'm inthe middle of an investigation.    Is it really possible fora Stand to k*ll its own user?    It is.    I've witnessed the phenomenonseveral times.    At present,the Stand is confined to her back.    But in time,    that thorny-plant Stand will likelyovertake Ms. Holly's entire body.    She will develop a high feverand various illnesses,    before slipping into a coma,never to awaken again.    Then death.    No ordinary doctor can see what we can,    much less cure her...    No one, not you nor I, can heal her.    But there is still hope.    It will take fifty days forthe Stand to take its toll.    We must locate and destroy Diobefore time runs out!    If we can sever the linkbetween her Stand and Dio,    we can save her!    Thank you, Jotaro.    I don't know what happened.    I don't know how I suddenlydeveloped a fever and passed out.    But...    -I feel better now.-It's on her back,    so she has no idea.    You had us all worried, Holly.    Here. You've got to brushyour teeth when you get up.    -Say, "ahh."-Ahh...    Now wipe your face...    Your hair is a mess.    Now for your nails...    -Ahh...-Ahhh...    Come help me change my undies, Papa.    Just kidding! I was joking!    Now, then, what would you like    -for dinner, Jotaro?-Hey...    Freeze! Stay in bed!    I mean, you should take it easy    until that fever of yours dies down.    Just keep quiet and restuntil you're better.    Holly, come on...    You're right.    You're all so nice when I'm sick.    I guess a little coldonce in a while isn't so bad.    Holly!    She's passed out cold again.    She was acting fine, but she's burning up.    That confirms it.    She didn't say a word, but shenoticed the Stand on her back.    Just like her to try and hide it from us.    Holly never wants us to worry!    That's who she is.    Mr. Joestar, I've found it!    That fly is...    this.    The Nile Tsetse Fly.    Found only near the banks of the Nile,    the striped leg varietyis known as the Aswan Tsetse fly.    Egypt!    He must be in the Aswan region.    That's where we'll find Dio!    So he's in Egypt after all...    Kakyoin.    What do you mean?    It was three months ago    that he embedded the flesh budinto my brain.    I met Dio while traveling withmy family on the Nile in Egypt.    You were in Egypt, too?    It would seem Diowishes to remain in Egypt.    When do we leave?    I'll go with you.    With us? Why?    Who can say...    I can't say I knowthe answer to that myself.    Let's just say you've opened my eyes.    That's all.    Holly... We'll save you.    Just rest.    There's nothing for you to worry about...    We will make you better again.    Just you rest.    Jojo's mother, Ms. Holly...she's a calming soul.    She can put you at easejust by being near her.    This may sound strange,but if I ever fall in love,    I hope it will be with a woman like her.    I feel like I want to protect her.    I want to see her feeling better,to see her smile again.    Indeed.    Time's running out! It's time to go!    They're doctors fromthe Speedwagon Foundation.    We can trust them.    They will take care of Hollyaround the clock.    Jojo, before we leave...    I am a fortune teller.    Allow me to give your Stand its name.    Name?    With the Tarot, the cards of fate.    Draw a card, but do not look at it.    It will reveal your destiny,along with the power of your Stand.    Your card! It's the Star!    Your Stand shall be named...    Star Platinum!    Jotaro Kujo.    Stand name: Star Platinum!    Ability: Precision andextraordinary strength!    Joseph Joestar.    Stand name: Hermit Purple!    Ability: Spirit photography!    Mohammed Avdol.    Stand name: Magician's Red!    Ability: Flames and heat!    Noriaki Kakyoin.    Stand name: Hierophant Green!    Ability: Remote Stand manipulationand Emerald Splash!    All right, we're off.    Let's hit the road!    NARITABANGKOK    ABOU DHABIKUWAIT    CAIRO    As I thought...    They have detected my location.    Will you make it?    To Egypt?    Joseph and Jotaro...    He saw us.    I just felt Dio looking at us.    -Yeah.-Stay on your guard.    A new Stand usermay already be on this plane.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    We've already found the next Stand user!    Impossible!It's faster than Star Platinum!    What?    It writhes in pain when torn apart.    Wow... He's so handsome!    Pardon me.    Do you have a moment?
02x04 - Tower of GrayQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:25There is, of course, the feeling of fear.  It's a natural emotionfound in all animals.  What do you think causes fear?  There is the kind of fear bornof animal instinct,  and the kind of fearborn of a rational mind.  That is, one may perceive fear whenfacing a foe stronger than oneself  and realizing there isno way of fighting back,  or when encountering the unknown.  The sheer uncertainty can be terrifying.   If faced with such fear,   a person has a number of optionsfrom which to choose.   One might struggle,resist, flee, or accept.   But upon meeting Lord Dio,a new, unexpected reaction arises...   One feels joy!   How do people act   once they feel joy in fear?   Our friend is currently on the plane   Joestar and the others have boarded.   They will find it utterly impossible   to reach their final destinationin one piece.   A rhino beetle?   No...   It's a stag beetle!   Is it a Stand, Avdol?   Did Dio already send one of his men?   It's possible...   A Stand that takes the form of an insect.   It hid in the shadow of the seats...   Where did it go?   Jojo! It's right by your head!     It's huge! It has to be a Stand.   That insect is a Stand!   Disgusting...   But I'll take care of it.   Be careful.   I've been told there is an insectile Stand   that likes to rip outthe tongues of its victims.   Star Platinum!   It dodged!   I don't believe it!   It's faster than Star Platinum,   a Stand who has the speed andprecision to grab a flying b*llet.   So it has to be a Stand.That bug's a Stand!   Where is he? Where is he hiding?   But where can the user be hiding?   Here it comes!   sh*t!   Jotaro!   Just in the nick of time,   it stopped the bug's needlewith its teeth, but...   It's after Jotaro's Stand's tongue...   It's him!   The Tower card of the Tarot...   It symbolizes destruction and calamity,   and the interruption of journeys.This stand is called,   Tower of Gray.   Tower of Gray is responsiblefor mass murders,   which he makes look like accidents!   They say the plane crashin England last year   that claimed     lives is his handiwork.   I've heard rumors of this Stand user,   but not that he's joined Dio!   It dodged it.   And not just a single jab,but a two-fisted barrage of blows.   Its speed is incredible...   Even if you fired ten g*ns at mefrom one centimeter away,   not a single b*llet would touch my Stand!   Not that a g*n could harm a Stand...   He has to be nearby!   Who is it?   Who could be controlling it?   Which passengers is it?   If we just knew who it is...   It's gone again!   Over there now!   What's it trying to do?   No, it wouldn't!   Bingo!   Got their tongues!   And now for the best part...   m*ssacre!   Its definition: complete slaughter!   He actually did it...   I'll incinerate that bug alive!   Magician's Red!   Wait! Avdol, wait it's...   What's with all the ruckus...   Something happen...   Look out!   Might as well take a walk to the bathroom.   What's this slimy stuff?   M... A...   It's b-blood! Blood!   Atemi.   We have to defeat itbefore it causes panic   among the passengers.   But, Avdol,   a Stand like your Magician's Red    could cause the airplane to explode.    And Jojo,    we can't have Star Platinumtearing any holes in the fuselage.    It'd be a catastrophe.    This calls for    a quiet, more discreet Standlike Hierophant Green.    Noriaki Kakyoin, eh?    Dio has told me all about you.    Don't bother.    You think you havesilence on your side, but...    your Stand can't keep up with my speed.    Is that so?    Emerald Splash!    Emerald Splash!    Thought if you fire enough sh*tsyou'd get me, huh?    You haven't hit me at all!    Blast it! He's too fast!    Kakyoin!    You're just not quick enough!    No bingo for you!    And now, Kakyoin...    With this next att*ck,your Stand's tongue is mine!    My Tower Needle will punctureyour tongue and rip it out!    Emerald Splash!    Don't you get it?    No! It's still managing to dodgehis Emerald Splash!    Once my Stand rips outHierophant's tongue, you'll go mad...    from the pain!    S'that right?    Once Hierophant's tongue's ripped out,    I'll go mad from the pain?    My Hierophant Green...    What?    ...will go mad all right...    Once it rips you apart, it'll go mad...    from pure joy!    I had already extendedHierophant's extremities    into and under the seats.    My use of Emerald Splashto move you into position    must've slipped your notice.    So it was you all along.    Seems repulsive Standshave repulsive users.    It appears he wasn't implantedwith one of Dio's flesh buds...    Tower of Gray would k*ll travelers,and make it look like an accident...    all for pay.    He was bought, blinded by greed.    He was Dio's pawn.    Something's wrong.    Is it me, or is this plane flying crooked?    No, I'm right.    It can't be!    Sir, may I ask where you are going?    I'm afraid the cockpit isoff limits to passengers.    I know that.    Sir!    Oh! He's so handsome.    Move, bitch.    The shock!    Whoa, there.    Ignore that.    His disrespectful behavioris clearly incorrigible...    But this is an emergency.    Please forgive him.    Okay...    Dammit!    He got us!    Their tongues have been ripped out.    That beetle bastard...    The pilots never had a chance!    We're falling.    The autopilot's knocked out.    We're gonna crash!    What?    My Stand is The Tower card,    symbol of accidents andthe end of a journey.    You will never make it to Lord Dio!    Even if you survive this crash,    you'll still be   ,    kilometersfrom Egypt!    Those loyal to Lord Dio willfollow you every hour of every day!    The world is rank with Stands    more horrific than you could ever imagine.    Lord Dio is the master of Stands!    He has the power to reign over all.    There's no way you'll reach him!    You will never make it to Egypt!    You stewardesses are real pros.    You didn't let out a single shriek.    And I never had to lose my temper.    Now, listen up.    This old man's gonnaland this heap on the water.    Make sure our passengershave their life jackets    and seat belts ready.    Got it!    Old man.    Well...    I have driven a prop plane before, but...    Prop plane?    You know, Jotaro...this ismy third time in a plane crash.    Have you ever heard of someonebeing in a plane crash three times?    No way in hell...    No way in hell I'm everriding with you again.     TOWER OF GRAYGRAY FLY    The plane landed    kilometersoff the Hong Kong coast.    Jotaro and the others had no choice.They diverted to Hong Kong.    ...Thirty-five kilometers southof Hong Kong, near Lamma Island.    Efforts are underwayto rescue all passengers.    Hong Kong!    Hong Kong Island! Kowloon!The New Territories!    With more than     islands in the area,    Hong Kong and its breathtaking night scape    is known the world overas the "Million Dollar View."    Right. That's fine.    Please make sure the only onesaboard are us and the crew.    Right. We don't want any more victims.    Also...    Hey, big guy!    You guys aren't from around here are ya?    Want some rice porridge?    Can't come to Hong Kong and not tryour dim sum or rice porridge.    We have some hot cola, too.    Rice porridge, eh? Not bad.    Did you know, Jojo?    Unlike in Japan, rice porridgeis a staple in Hong Kong.    One bowl, the popular way,with pork and century egg.    Coming right up!    In that case I'll haveâ    Hey!    You boys think we have time to eat?    We're going to my old favorite.    Hey, dandy guy.    Want to try some Hong Kong hot cola?    Hot?    Everybody knows it's supposed to be cold.    Old man, who were you just calln?    Hm? Oh, I'll explain whenwe get to the restaurant.    We need to work out a planthat'll get us to Egypt    as safely and quickly as possible.    A plan?    Mr. Joestar,    we cannot allow any moreinnocent civilians to be hurt.    The quickest way would be by plane, but...    Indeed.    Traveling by plane to Egypt is nowcompletely out of the question.    If we encounter another Stand user    like the last one on a commercial flight,    we'll cause a disasterthat will harm many people.    We'll have to get to Egyptby either land or sea.    But if we fail to find Diowithin fifty days...    If we could've stayed on that plane,    we'd probably be in Cairo by now.    I'm well aware of that.    But it's to soon to panic.    A hundred years ago, Jules Vernewrote the novel,    Around the World in    Days.    That's a journey of   ,    kilometers.    And that was the era ofsteam engines and steamboats.    Even without a plane, in fifty days,    we can easily coverthe   ,    kilometers to Egypt.    As for the route...    I say we go by sea.    We can charter a decent-sized boat,    and circumvent the Malay Peninsula,to the Indian Ocean.    A Silk Road of the sea, as it were.    I too agree that is best.    Crossing boarders could bring trouble.    And we'd have to crossthe Himalayas and the desert.    We could lose a great deal of time.    The dangers are too many.    I haven't traveled tothose places using either route,    so I can't offer any advice.    I'll leave it up to you two.    Same.    Then it's decided.    The greatest danger that lies aheadis the Stand users sent by Dio.    The question is, how do we sneakinto Egypt undetected?    This is how you signal you want more tea.    In Hong Kong,place the teapot lid like this,    and they'll bring you some more.    When you've been poured your tea...    This means "thank you."    Pardon me. Sorry to bother.    I'm visiting from France,    and I'm having some difficultymaking sense of the menu.    Would you, perchance, be able totell me what these characters mean?    You're annoying. Get out of here.    Come now, Jotaro. Give him a break.    I've been to Hong Kong enoughto read a menu, at least.    Why don't you join us?    So, what sounds good?    How about some shrimp, duck, shark fin,    and something with mushrooms?    We'll have this, this, this...    And this, too.    Oh, and this.    This looks like beef, fish,clams, and frog, to me...    Indeed, this is quite differentfrom our order.    I knew this would happen.    Well, it doesn't matter.    It's all on me, boys!    Besides, it doesn't matter what you order.    It's all delicious!    All right, everyone, dig in.    Oh, this is...    See that? And you were worried.    Well, they've certainly takena lot of time to prepare this.    Take these carrots, for example...    Cut into perfect little stars.    In fact, they remind me of something...    I remember now.    Someone I know has a mark,    a birthmark just like thison the back of his neck...    You...    Are you another...    Mr. Joestar, look out!    It's a Stand!    Magician's Red!    What?    Another Stand user!    He has such speed with his sword...    My Stand is The Chariot card,and his name is...    Silver Chariot!    Mohammed Avdol,it appears you wish to die first.    I've carved a burning clockinto that table!    Before the clock strikes twelve,    you will be a dead man!    Would you like to be friends with me?    Something is bothering you.    Stick with me, and it'll disappearfrom your heart.    That left arm is not a right arm.    To think you're trying touse fortune-telling    to fight a fortune teller...
02x05 - Silver ChariotQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:27You have a way with a sword,  I'll grant you that.  So you think you can k*ll me  before the flames on that tablestrike twelve?  You seem to have quite the ego.  And you are...?  Polnareff.  Allow me to properly introduce myself.  That's Jean Pierre Polnareff.   Merci beaucoup.   My thanks for the introduction.   However...   Monsieur Polnareff,   you would be mistakenif you assume my flames   burn upward or with the wind.   I can control fire at will,thus the name "Magician's Red."   In the beginning, there was fire.   I should have expected as muchfrom Magician's Red,   the emblem of beginnings,the wielder of fire, of creation.   And yet, you speak of ego?   This swordsmanship of mine...   is this mere ego?!   In the moment they lined up,   he stabbed through all five coinsin a single strike!   No. Look closer.   That's...   I see... He's cut a flame for each coin.   So you comprehendthe significance of my moves.   I am no egoist.   My Stand can slice apart flames!   I can rip apart the atmosphere itself,   creating gaps between the layers of gases.   Which means your flames arepowerless before my Silver Chariot.   When did he...   My Stand...   The Chariot is the cardof victory and conquest.   I could dispose of youin this modest room, but...   is not your flame ability bettersuited to wide-open spaces, Avdol?   To destroy you at your best   is the only victory worthy of my Stand.   All of you, outside!     What is this place?   Tiger Balm Garden.   What?   Tiger Balm Garden,   a mysterious tableaulocated on the hillside of   Hong Kong's Tai Hang Road.   Its unique aesthetic and sense of style   make it one of Hong Kong'smost unusual sites.   Allow me to make a prediction...   First, Avdol,   you shall perish at the handof your own Stand.   Avdol...   Jotaro, I won't need your assistance.   In an expansive arena such as this,   I can manipulate my Stand to the full.   Come on!   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Come on. What's wrong?   Not going to spit those flames of yours?   If not, then I'll finish you right now!   Come on! Come on! Come on!   That bastard. He's mocking us.   While he was attacking,   he managed to carve a statueof Magician's Red.   Not bad...   You fit right in, Magician's Red.   Finally.   At last he reveals his true power...   Interesting...   Bring it.   Hey, we gotta hide!   We'll get torched if Avdol uses that.   "That"?   Crossfire Hurricane!   That all you've got?!   I told you my sword   can create gaps betweenthe layers of our atmosphere,   so I can slice your flames into bits!   Avdol!   His flames are so strong,they're burning him!   Just as I predicted.   You will die by your own flames!   Good grief!   One last pitiful att*ck?   How unsightly!   That's weird, that blow...   What?   Impossible!   I cut him in half, and out pour flames?   That's not his Stand.   It's a duplicate!   It seems the flames veiled your vision.   What you sliced apart   was the statue Silver Chariotcarved from before.   I told you, I can control flames at will.   The flames that it sent back toward it   melted its joints and caused it to move.    The one defeated byhis own Stand's ability was you!    Now, another chance to savor the heat...    Crossfire Hurricane!    I'm afraid you're ten years too young    to challenge a fortune tellerto a battle of prediction!    Such incredible power!    His Stand took that head-on,it must have melted. It's over!    With burns like that,    I'm guessing he's a goner.    He's lucky if he escapedwith just serious burns...    if you could call that luck.    If he lives,he'll be in bed for three months.    His Stand is destroyed.He's out of commission.    Now, Mr. Joestar,    I think it's time we geton our way to Egypt.    Indeed.    What?    His Stand is breaking apart!    He flew into the air while unconscious?!    Bravo! Oh, bravo!    He's...    I don't believe it!    He's completely unharmed!    How is he floating in mid air?    Look closely with your inner eye.    That's...    Yes, you see?    Behold, my Stand,Silver Chariot, armor-free!    You're speechless.    Well, I suppose it wouldn'tbe very chivalrous,    if I were to k*ll you allright here and now    without fully explaining my powers first.    Perhaps you will bekind enough to indulge me?    Very well.    Let us hear your explanation.    My Stand did not break apartand disappear.    Silver Chariot is equippedwith protective armor.    That is what it shed earlier.    Your flames b*rned awayonly part of its armor...    which is why I escapedwith only minor injuries.    And now that the armor is off,I'm light as a feather.    Were you able to catch a glimpseof my stand as it held me up?    That is how quickly it can move now!    I see...    The weight of your armor    made you vulnerableto my Crossfire Hurricane.    But, of course, you must know nowthat you're naked    and without protection.    The next hit will cost you your life.    Hmm...    Oui, perhaps.    Though I'd venture that's highly unlikely.    Unlikely? I'd like to test that theory.    First, allow me to show you something    that will surely boggle your mind.    By all means.    What?    He now has six...no, seven Stands!    Impossible.    A person can have only one Stand.    It seems you're sufficiently befuddled.    These are afterimages.    An entire army of Stand afterimagesto deceive your sight    and your hearing.    Your senses can't follow their movements.    How about this sword speed?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    Red Bind!    I told you you can't keep up.    Your flames grasp only afterimages.    Striking at random now?    You're getting a bit desperate, Avdol.    It's true;he'll end up exhausting himself.    Crossfire Hurricane!    Non.    That was just an image.    Your att*cks will not workagainst my Stand.    Come on, come on, come on!    Avdol!    Such precision. His...    Stand ability...it's been trained at length.    For nearly ten years, in fact...I have my reasons why.    Now, hurry up and att*ck.    I'd like to end this post haste.    I must say, to revealthe nature of your att*ck    is a rather noble deed.    Now allow me to do the same...to return the favor.    Oh?    This, as a matter of fact,    is a variation of my Crossfire Hurricane.    You'll recognize the Ankh shape,but the number differs.    I can divide it into multiple blasts.    Crossfire Hurricane    Special!    Dodge this!    You are a fool, Avdol!    His Stands assumed a circular formation!    He has no opening!    Naive! Naive, naive, naive, naive!    So naive!    I'll strike you down with your own power    just as I did before!    I'll slice the flames and throw them back!    What?    That's...    The hole he made earlier...    I get it!    That flame dug a tunnel,    a tunnel for his Crossfire Hurricane!    As I told you,    I can divide my flame andlaunch it as multiple att*cks.    Fire is an agonizing way to perish.    Take the dagger and end it.    I was conceited.    I never thought my swordsmanshipcould lose to fire.    I choose to perish slowly from my burns.    I owe at least that much respectto the man who has    to the man who hasso skillfully defeated me.    It would be cowardly to end it myself.    His sense of honorendures to the very end!    And he didn't use the daggerto att*ck me from behind!    His honor is too greatto yield to Dio's orders.    It would be a disservice to k*ll him.    There's a reason behind his actions...    Jojo!    Yeah.    Yuck! Those tentacles are disgusting!    Jotaro, hurry up and pull it out!    -Shut up, old man.-Come on!    There!    Now that the flesh bud is gone,we can be buddies.    Ta-da!    Kakyoin, don't people whomake stupid puns all the time    get on your nerves, or it just me?    The boat we chartered fromthe Speedwagon Foundation yesterday    should be at the harbor now.    What's wrong?    Something on your mind, Polnareff?    I never thanked you properly forfreeing me from Dio's mind control.    Don't thank me, thank Jojo.    I'm good.    It was a kind thought, but it seemsto have fallen on deaf ears.    As you wish. I've no desireto come off as heavy-handed.    But I'm not quite finished here.    Monsieur Joestar,    I hope you'll indulge my askinga very bizarre question.    Bizarre question?    It's none of my business,    but I noticed you never took offyour gloves, even while eating.    Your left hand wouldn't happento be a right hand, would it?    What? My left hand a right one?    You weren't kiddingabout the bizarre part.    What are you talking about?    I'm looking for the manwho m*rder*d my sister.    I don't know what he looks like.    But I do know he has two right hands.    It's a wound from fifty years ago...a badge of honor.    I apologize for being so rude.Please forgive me.    If it's not too painful,tell me what happened.    It was three years ago...    My little sister waswalking home from school    with a classmate one rainy day.    In our hometown...a smallcountryside village in France.    On the side of the road,a man stood with his back to them.    Strangely, in the middle of pouring rain,    as if surrounded bysome invisible membrane,    the rain fell in torrents around him.    Then suddenly,    her classmate's chest wassliced open, as if with a sickle.    And then...    He had his way with her and left her dead.    The man wanted nothing more.    Her friend escaped with her life...    to tell me the tale of that fateful day.    She never did see his face,    but saw that he had two right hands.    No one believed her, but I knew.    I knew that man had a power    not unlike that which I hadbeen hiding all these years.    He's a Stand user, all right.    I swore an oath!    I promised my sister's soulI would avenge her,    to hunt down that k*ller andmake him pay with his life!    And I would use my Standas a means of righteous vengeance!    Then, one year ago, I met Dio.    I see something in the crystal ball.    It's...    It is a vision.Not from my heart but from yours.    The man you seek, the pain you hide,    my power only brings it into focus.    How about it?    Why don't we become friends?    You are distressed. You are suffering.    Join me, and your sufferingwill soon be a thing of the past.    The image in the globeis what pains you, no?    Lend me your strength.    I too am suffering.    I have been deniedthe sun's embrace for all eternity.    That is why I need your strength.    Allow me to find him for you.    Then I was ordered to k*ll you all.    I felt it was the right thing to do.    The flesh bud is partially responsible,    but it seems he's quite the manipulator.    Indeed. And judging by that story,    I would wager that the manwith two right hands    is already his underling.    I've made up my mind!I want to travel with you to Egypt!    By going after Dio,    I'll find the onewho took my sister's life!    What do we do?    I've no objections.    Even if we told him no,he'd just follow along.    Jean Pierre Polnareff.    Stand name: Silver Chariot.    Ability:Fast and precise swordsmanship!    The honor is mine.    -Good grie...-Excuse me!    Would you mind taking our picture?    He's so cute.    What a great excuse to talk to him.    Thank you!    We want our backs toward the ocean.    Shut up already! Go bug someone else!    Now, now, now, now...    I'd be glad to take your picture.    Come, come.    You have very nice legs.    I'll be sure to get them in the sh*t.    Ooh, nice!    And another just in case.    TrÃ¨s bien!    If only...    I could take your heartinstead of your picture!    His personality is mystifying.    His emotions change on a dime.    More like he's got two brains,    and the one downstairssuddenly started calling the sh*ts.    Good grief.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    Can't you do something about that uniform?    Students should act like students.    Bring it on! I'll take you!    Was that a Stand user?    If a Stand user inhalesany cigarette smoke at all...    By the way...
02x06 - Dark Blue MoonQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:28Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Ms. Holly has gaineda Stand as well!  You will never make it to Lord Dio!  But if we fail to find Diowithin fifty days...  Someone I know has a mark,  a birthmark just like thison the back of his neck...  What?  I've made up my mind!I want to travel with you to Egypt!  By going after Dio,   I'll find the onewho took my sister's life!   The loathsome curse of Dio...   Even the Speedwagon Foundation'sleading physicians,   with their cutting-edge treatments,stand powerless before Dio's curse.   To save Holly,   Jojo and crew continueon their journey to Egypt.   With air travelnow too treacherous,   they board a boat,heading first to Singapore.   It'll take three full days at seato get from Hong Kong to Singapore.   Some peace and quietwill do us all good.   Hey, you two...   Why don't you switch outthose uniforms for something else?   You think you can keep upin those things?   Aren't you burning up?   Well, we are students...   And a good studentalways dresses the part...   Too much of a stretch?   Japanese studentsare such stiffs, aren't they?   I see...so this is what they call Bushido.   Like they say, clear your mind,and even flames feel cool.   That's all well and good,but that won't get you any girls.   Let go! Let go of me,you big jerk!   -Dammit, I said get off me! Let me go!-Shut your trap! Ya brat!   Hey, what's going on?   I thought we agreed there'd beno passengers onboard but us.   -Let go!-Sorry, sir. It's a stowaway.   Little brat was hiding inone of the storage holds below.   Stowaway?   Come at me, then!   I'll freakin break your balls!   Tell that to the coast guard,ya little sh*t.   Huh? The cops?   Please. Just let me go!   I just wanted to go to Singaporeto see my dad.   I'll do anything! You can evenput me to work for my ticket!   Let's see. What should I do?   Should I let you go?   -Or turn you in?-Please!   What to do?   -Ow!-No way I'm letting you go.   That'd be too easy.   But first, I'm gonna letthe Captain know.   Come wit...   Whoa! In he goes!That kid's got guts.   He's trying to swim to shore?   What should we do?   Forget 'em.   He wouldn't have jumped inif he wasn't a decent swimmer.   He's in trouble now!   These waters areinfested with sharks!   This isn't good!   Hey, kid! Come back!   Get back here! It's dangerous!   Sharks! There are sharks out there!   Huh?   Good grief, c'mon you brat.   You're...   A girl?   And a runty one, at that.   How dare youfeel me up like that?   Hands off!   Good grief.   Jotaro! Below you!   Something's coming after youfrom underwater!   It's not a shark!And it's racing towards you!   Jotaro!You have to get out of there now!   Hurry! Swim to the boat!   He's too far away.   That distance is no problem for me.   Hierophant Green!   It just disappeared!It's a Stand!   That thing is a Stand!   An aquatic Stand...   In all my dealings with the occult,I've never heard of such a thing!   This girl...There's no way she's the...   Could she be that Stand's user?   Did she try to lure Jojointo shark-infested water?   Geez, what's with you jerks?Quit staring at me like that!   I have no ideawhat's going on here,   but I'll fight you!   Don't underestimate me, okay?You're gonna regret this!   One-on-one!Come at me, I dare ya!   Ya punks!   She can't be serious.   Maybe we should toss her backinto the ocean.   Calm down.   If she is just a stowaway,the sharks will get her.   We've checked outall ten members of the crew.   She's the only one it could be.    Is there some waywe could be sure?    Hey, how's that devil Diodoing these days?    Dio? What the hell is that?    Don't pretend like you don't know,you little brat!    I warned you, punks!    You gonna be a man and talk to me,or do you just want to get shanked?    Which is it, huh?    My demon blade wants to slurpthe blood of its    th victim.    What's so funny, stupid jerk hole?    Jerk hole?    I'm starting to get the feelingshe's not our Stand user.    Yes, but who then...    This girl our stowaway?    Captain.    -I'm pretty strict-O-Ow...    -when it comes to stowaways.-Ow...    You may be a girl,but if I go easy on you,    we'll just getmore and more stowaways.    I think we'll lock you upin the brig below deck    until we make it to port.    Captain, I'd like toask you something.    You've verified the identities ofall ten of the men on board, right?    Of course.    They're all men who've workedwith me for over ten years.    Can't say I understand whythat is of prime importance.    By the way...    I must implore younot to smoke on deck.    What did you plan to dowith the ashes and butt?    Just toss them over the sideinto these pristine waters?    You may be a guest on this ship,    but you will abide by my rules,tough guy.    Got it?    Hold it, pops.    Then why didn't you just say so?    Don't be a condescending prickabout the whole thing, ya jackass.    Hey, Jotaro! Don't be disrespectfulto the captain!    You were in the wrong.    I'll be as rude as I want.    I figured it out.He's not the captain...    He's the Stand user!    What?    Sta...nd?    I'm not sure I follow...    That's inconceivable, Jotaro.    We chose Captain Dragonbecause he came recommended    with verificationby the Speedwagon Foundation.    He's someone we can trust.    He absolutely can't bea Stand user.    Hold on, a Stand?    I have no idea what you guysare talking about...    Jojo, random guesses will onlymake things more confusing!    Do you have any real proof, Jojo?    I've found a wayto identify Stand users.    -What?-That is...    When a Stand user    takes even the slightest whiffof cigarette smoke,    a vein pops upon the tip of their nose.    What the hell are they all doing?    You're not serious, Jotaro!    Relax, I'm lying.    Apparently, someone fell for it.    Jotaro, what tipped you offabout the captain?    Actually, I didn't have a clue.    I'd planned to use that trickon the whole crew.    And I fell for it.Hat's off to you, boy.    You're right. I'm not the captain.    The real captain issleeping with the fishes    at the bottom of the China Sea.    Then I guess that meansyou'll be snoozing in hell!    Damn!    I can't move...    Trouble on the water!Lies and betrayal!    The Moon card representsthe fear of the unknown.    Its name: Dark Blue Moon!    Five-on-one is a little tougheven for me,    which is why I keptmy identity secret    to pick you off one by one...    But since you've figured me out,I guess I have no choice.    Five-on-one it is!    Getting my hands on hershows that lady luck is on my side!    Now I think I'll take a dipin these shark-infested waters    with the runt.    If you wanna save her,    you're gonna have todive in after us.    On my home turf,I can take on all five of you.    Go on, act tough while youhide behind a hostage!    It'll take a lot more than thatto shake me up!    It's no act. It's a prediction!    I hear your Stand,Star Platinum, is pretty fast.    Not trying to brag,    but my Dark Blue Moonis king underwater.    It's far swifter thanany fish in the sea!    Why don't we pit themagainst each other right now?    Come on in...if you're not afraidof a little seawater, that is!    He hit me before I could fall...    That's impossible...    You're the only oneswallowin' salt water today, pops.    Tell 'em, Avdol.    Your folly was trying toout-predict a fortune teller...    ...tough break.    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    There he goes.    For talking up his Stand so much,that was a pretty pathetic exit.    What's wrong, Jotaro?Pull the girl up, would ya?    What's wrong, Jotaro?    Damn it...Something's pulling me in...    These are...    barnacles!    Crustaceans that live betweenhigh and low tides!    They stretch fromStar Platinum's arm    all the way tothe side of the boat!    He's still gotsome fight left in him.    He must've attached themwhen I hit him before.    They're spreading!    He's trying to drainmy Stand's power...    Now he's gone!    The captain,he's completely disappeared!    Jotaro! Pull in your Stand!    What do you think I'm trying to do?    That's why I'm sweatinglike a freakin pig, old man!    -Jojo!-Jotaro!    Jojo!    Crap!    This isn't good!    Welcome! Welcome!    So glad you could join mein the watery depths,    where Dark Blue Moon rules.    You should have neverunderestimated me, brother.    We may be underwater,but our Stands can still talk.    How bout you pop out another one ofthose cocky one-liners like before.    Go ahead, brother!    So what'll it be?    Tell me what kind offish dish you want to be.    Fish paste? Or maybe some sashimi?    I'll make one hell of a mealout of your Stand.    You fool...    You act tough, brother,    but I know what you're thinking.    "How long can this guystay underwater?    I could probably lasttwo minutes, tops.    Could he last longer?"    Well, guess what?    My lung capacity is three timesthat of a normal human!    And I've been in training.    My personal best issix minutes, twelve seconds!    You must be dizzyjust hearing that number.    And!    Dark Blue Moon's flippers    slice through the waterwith sharp, screw like rotations!    But before you startmouthing off again,    take a good, hard lookat your Stand!    Seems Dark Blue Moon's barnacles    have taken a liking toabsorbing your Stand's power.    How's it feel to haveyour life energy    slowly draining away?    Trying to escape to the surface?    Take a good look around you!    Dark Blue Moon's been busymaking a whirlpool.    Haven't you noticed, brother?    Swim! Come on, swim!    You're running out of airand strength!    But k*lling a stupid, smart-asspunk like you right now    would be a bit too early!    It's been too long!He's not coming up yet?    A whirlpool!It's a giant whirlpool!    But where's Jojo?    I'm going in!    These are scales!    That guy's Stand has scalesas sharp as razors!    The whirlpool is full of them!    He wasn't bluffing when he saidhe could b*at us one-on-five.    It's like a watery antlion pitdown there!    If we dive in, it's very possiblewe'll be sliced to pieces.    His scales?    Let me guess whatyou're thinking now!    "A whirlpool hasone point of calm."    I can read you like a book!    "It's the eye!    If I jump into the centerwhere he is, I can att*ck him."    That's what you're thinking,isn't it?    If you think you can hit mewith that punch of yours again,    then come right over.    Come at me withyour worthless Stand,    its power is so drained,it doesn't have a chance!    See if you can manage an att*ck    that's even sharper thanthese underwater cutters!    I'm waiting, brother!    Curses...We're completely helpless!    It's Jojo!    I saw Jojo in the whirlpool!    This isn't good!He was limp!    Limp? He wasn't struggling at all?    That might be a good thing.    What?    Weren't you going toturn me into sashimi?    You're the onewho's going to be sliced up!    Star Finger!    Wha...    Looks like you're sashimi,after all.    What's that? I can't hear you.You're gonna have to speak up!    We're underwater!    But your power was being drained...    You let yourself go limp on purpose    to concentrate your powerin your fingers...    That's what you were thinking...    Nope. The only thing on my mind...    is how gross it'll be,when I kick your stupid ass,    and you piss yourself underwater.    Bye, pops.    Jojo!    That's my grandson!    Well done, Jotaro!Now get up here already.    The captain planted bombson the ship!    Damn it!    Hurry up and get in the lifeboats!    Send out a distress call!     DARK BLUE MOONFAKE CAPTAIN DRAGON    Have some water.    We've sent out distress calls,so someone should be here soon.    What the hell is going on here?Who are you guys?    Just think of usas fellow travelers.    You're on a journeyto see your father,    while I'm on one for my daughter.    Hey! That's the onlyfresh water we have!    Don't spit it out!    No...    Everyone, look!    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    What is this boat?    The ramp's down, so why hasn'tanyone shown their face?    There are no signs of life.    I'm all sticky from the salt water...

02x07 - StrengthQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:29Enyaba, I have somethingI'd like to ask you.  What does it mean to live?  It is to obtain all that what one desires.  If you were to distill lifeinto its essence,  that is what it would be.  A desire for riches, a desire for fame,  for food, love, and lovers...  But one must always fightto obtain what one wants,  isn't that correct, Enyaba?   Indeed.   And if the battle is lost,   and one fails to obtainwhat one desires most,   the result is frustration, pain,and a sense of failure.   One carries the wound into the future,   into the next fearful battle.   I believe conquering that fearonce and for all   is what it means to live.   The one who stands at the pinnacleis the one who has no fear.   Do you understand, Enyaba?   I was the one who told you about   the existence of your Standand how to use it.   Also you have an immortal body.   Is there anything you could possibly fear?   Perhaps.   What burdens you, my lord?   The Joestar bloodline.   The Joestars? They worry you?Those worms are mere trash.   They are no match for your Stand!   Yes...   But I must believe it's destinywhen the lives of those worms   are so thoroughly entangled with my own.   Let me be clear...   It is not the Joestars whom I fear.   But the fact that I can neverunderestimate their bloodline.   I have decided that I must removethe Joestars from the cogs of fate.   You desire to go forthand eliminate them yourself   simply because you feelthey must not be underestimated?   Yes.   Foolishness!   You must never engagein such trivial matters!   I have sent seven Stand users to command:   The Empress, The Hanged Man,Strength, The Wheel of Fortune,   Temperance, The Emperor, and The Devil.   All of them ready to strike!   Thanks to them, you need nottake any action yourself, Lord Dio.   Whoa!   It's a freighter!   It just appeared out of nowhere!   Jotaro, something's bothering you,isn't it?   You worried another Stand user'son this thing, too?   Not quite.   Strange they lowered the stairs   but there's not a single soulto be seen anywhere.   The ship came all this way to rescue us!   Some sort of crew has to be onboard!   Well, I don't careif they're all Stand users.   I'm getting on this boat.   Take my hand, kid. I'll help you up.   Good grief.   What's with this ship?   There's no captain in the control room!   No engineer in the radio room.   There's no one anywhere!   And yet, look at this!   All the gauges and machineryare working just like normal.   Maybe they're all just in the bathroom   with a bad case of the runs!   Hey! Isn't anyone around?   Guys, come quick!   An ape!   An ape's sitting in that cage.   It's an orangutan.   Who the hell cares about a friggin ape?   Let's split up and findwhoever's been feeding this thing.   Well?   It doesn't appear to be broken, but...   Avdol! That sailor! Watch out!   Good grief.   That isn't any way togreet a lady, now is it?   No one was touching the controls...   Nobody touched the lever.   That crane moved all by itself! I saw it!   That crane impaled him on its own!   Careful! Something's here.   Hey! Don't touch the machinery!   If it moves or runs on electricity,don't lay a finger on it!   If you want to live, then you'll doexactly as I tell you.   Get into the cabin belowuntil I tell you otherwise!   Did anyone see a Stand just now?   No...   My apologies...   I was closest to the crane,yet I sensed nothing.   All right. I'll send Hierophantto investigate!   I have no idea what's going on,   but scary things keep happeningwhenever you guys are around.   Could you guys be jinxed?   I've heard about people who causedisasters that endanger everyone.   If that's what you are,   I'd better stay away.    I can tell you one thing for certain:    We are on your side.    Make sure you stay with the others.Got it?    Okay.    You want me to let you out?    I can't.    I don't know where the key is.Plus you're too big to let out.    You're giving me an apple?    Strange...    This apple's been cut with a Kn*fe,and it hasn't gone brown yet...    It must've just been cut.    Hey, so there is someonesomewhere on this boat, right?    Do you know wherethe person who feeds you is?    You sure are a smart monkey.    A monkey like youis actually into looking at    pinups of girls?    Hey, kid, be careful!    I've heard an orangutan    has five times the strengthof the average human.    He could easily rip off your arm.    Now, come with usto the room down the hall.    You can't be alone.    Okay...    It's inconceivable.    I had Hierophant Greenscour every corner...    yet no sign of human life.    We searched every pipeand crevice, but nothing!    Anything?    It's no use. I can't get a connection.    Well, try again, dammit!    Gross, I'm all stickyfrom the salt water...     DESTRUCTIVE POWER, SPEED     RANGE, PERSISTENCE,PRECISION, DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL    Hey!    Jojo!    You forgot your lock!    Seems this ape...isn't your run-of-the-mill monkey.    Could he be...    Could he have ripped out the fan?    So this ape's a Stand user.    But where's the Stand?    Why can't I see it?    What?    The steel propeller bent on its own?    -Jojo!    -Hey, what's going on here?    Son of a bitch!    There's no Stand in sight andsomehow the window broke?    Star Platinum!    What's with this thing?    The ape just sank into the walland disappeared!    Hey. You saw that, right?    Stay close to me.    It's not safe in here.    The ape vanished into the wall...    But that orangutanhas to be the Stand user...    When I touched it,    I could feel Stand energyemanating from him.    But why can't I see the Stand?    Wait... What if I'm seeing it already...    What?    What is this?    Crap!    This is...    This freighter...    Could this ship itself be...    So the Stand is the freighter!    Crap!    All of it! Everything!    This ship itself is justone gigantic Stand!    The ship?    But non-Stand users like the girland sailors can see it! How?    The Stand must use so much energythat it's visible to the naked eye!    But it would takean enormous amount of power    to control a Stand like this.    Kakyoin!    You have to use Hierophant Greento let Jotaro know!    I can't!    It's got hold of my Stand, too.    So this is what it means to face death.    We're completely done for.    It's crushing us...    At this rate, our bodiesare going to be pulverized.    We'll all be...    We were careless...    The word the orangutanwas pointing to was "strength."    It means force, energy, power, or aid.    And...it is the eighth cardof the Tarot deck!    It suggests challenge,a strong will, and hidden powers!    Damn ape, thinks he's already won.    "This entire ship is my Stand."    "You've lost!"    "And there's nothing you can do!"    Jotaro needed no explanation.    He knew exactly what the ape was saying!    That button's not your Stand.    Does that upset you?    I guess it wounded your pride,    since you thought you'd already won.    Nah, it's not hurt at all...    Cause ape's like you've got no pride!    That's exactly what makes youan ape and not a man.    What's going to hurt now...    is your head!    Good grief.    I've heard frightened animalsexpose their bellies    as a display of submission.    Are you asking me to forgive you?    I'm afraid your actions haveoverstepped the laws of the jungle.    So I don't think so.    It's all deformed...The whole ship is twisting up!    Hey, save it, will ya?    This ship's going down.    It's time to go.Get back to the life boats!    I can't believe it.    The ship's totally changing.    It's turning into a shabby little boat...    What terrifying power...    That ape was travelingthe ocean on its own Stand.    Never before have I witnessed such energy.    We were completely helpless.    If Jotaro hadn't figured it out,we would've been done for.    I hate to think this power andferocity could be a sign    of things to come.    Hey, you want some gum?    So we're lost at sea again.    Good grief. This cig is soaked.    We'll have plenty of timefor them to dry, Jojo.    Just have to pray we get rescuedand taken to Singapore.    It's been four days since we left Japan...    There are    days left untiltime runs out for the Joestars.     STRENGTHFOREVER    It appears Strength has been defeated.    But have no fear.    The remaining six Stand usersare all very powerful.    And one of them is my own!    My son's right handwill crush our enemies!    You are a strange old woman.    What is it that you desire most?    Oh, but I've told you many times...    My only wish is to stay by your side.    Your guardian spirithas unbelievable power.    Your ability to escape trouble,and your strange life,    are the result of that.    I would like to see your life unfold!    It's the only thing I want...    Once upon a time, there wasa prince from the land of Sumatra    who traveled the seas, seeking new lands.    Eventually, he happened upon an island    inhabited by white-manned lionscalled Singas,    an island he named Singa Pura.    Today, its straits bustlewith ships and tankers    from around the world!    This nation that shares bothWestern and Eastern heritage    thanks to free trade is Singapore!    Good grief. We finally made it.    We'll stay at a hotel tonightand figure out our route to Egypt.    All right, let's stay at that one.    I guess you guys won't evengive us a chance to rest.    She'll be in danger if she stays with us.    And Polnareff fell into that trap?    -There...-...is...    -...a...-...traitor.    Joestar, you bastard.
02x08 - The DevilQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:29Hey, you!  Yeah, you with the flat top!  Yeah, you! You threw this trash,didn't you?  That's a five-hundredSingapore dollar fine!  What? Five hundred?  Here in Singapore,   the law prohibits littering andfines all violators for doing so!  Five hundred Singapore dollars...  That's about forty thousand yen.   Trash?   Got it?   Trash?   What are you talking about, sir?   All I see on the ground hereis my own luggage.   Would you be so kind as to tell me   what trash you're referring to, officer?   You sure you see some trash?   You mean, that bag's your luggage?   Yeah, you got it.   I'm terribly sorry.   Well, I'll be going, then...   Shoo, shoo.   What's up with this kid?She's back with us again?   Hey, weren't you goingto go see your father?   Stop hanging around and get going. Shoo!   I'm meeting him in five days.   And I can go wherever the hell I want!   I'm not taking orders from you, jerks.   It's not safe for a little girlto accompany us.   Well maybe she lacks the cashfor a place to stay.   Then that's it...   We'll have to get her a room.   Hey, Polnareff,   get her to come with us,and try not to bruise her ego.   You got it.   Hey!   You're stinkin' poor, aren't you?   Consider this your lucky day, freeloader.   Well, let's check in...   Right...   I'm terribly sorry, sir,   but we tend to be bookedthis time of year.   The rooms we have availableare located on different floors.   Is that all right, sir?   Well, I guess we're stuck.   Then for the rooms...   Avdol and I will share a room...   It'd make sense forJotaro and I to share a room,   since we're both students.   Then that leaves the last roomto Polnareff and...   You're kidding!Like I'd room with that guy!   What?   Well, she may be a child,   but let's give the young ladyher own room...   We'll take four rooms please.   Yes, of course!   Fine, I can relax morein my own room anyway!   I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight!   Let's go.   We've been through all kinds of hell   ever since we left Hong Kong.   We should hurry up and take a shower   in a place where it's actually safe.   See ya!   I should've guessed.   Couldn't you guys at leastgive us a chance to rest?   Come out.    EPISODE EIGHT: THE DEVIL   That's some insanely intensebloodlust you've got there.   How about telling me your name,before I, Polnareff, take you out.   My name is Soul Sacrifice,   and my Stand is the card of the Devil.   It represents insanity of the cursed,   and a precipitous and malevolentfall into ruin.   But tell me, how did you knowI was hiding in the fridge?   You... Dumbass bastard!   You took everything out of the fridge   and didn't bother putting any of it away!   Ebony Devil!   Silver Chariot!   Wow, you're really pathetic, aren't you?   That ape on the boat   was a far more powerful andterrifying Stand user than you.   Now look at what you've done, Polnareff!   How dare you do this to me?   It hurts!   It really hurts!   What the hell?   The pain!   Curse you...   How dare you? How dare you do this to me?   Now I can hold one hell ofa grudge against you!   Such t*rture...Such agony must be avenged!   I let you find me andatt*ck me on purpose!   He's...   He's gone?   What the hell is going on?   This is unreal! When did he cut me?   I don't think I...No, I know I didn't feel a thing.    Mr. Joestar! A Stand userwas hiding in my room!    Wait, is that you, Avdol?    Anyway, listen up!I can't figure this guy out.    I couldn't tellif he was weak or strong...    He's really creepy!    And he got away... Damn it, what the hell?    You'd better watch out!    Somehow he was able to slice open my leg.    The Devil card? Soul Sacrifice...    Are you absolutely certainthat's what he said?    Yeah. I'm racking my brain,I just don't see how it's possible.    I did catch a glimpse of his Stand.    And yet, he was in no positionto att*ck me    when my leg was gouged.    Anyway!    I should be there in five.    You're in room twelve-twelve, aren't you?    On the twelfth floor?    Get Kakyoin and Jotaro, too,will ya? Later!    Front desk.    Hello? Room service?    I hurt my leg a bit...    Could you send upsome medicine and bandages?    This is Polnareff, from room nine-twelve.    Certainly.We'll bring it up immediately, sir.    Aw, geez...    No matter how you cut it,    dirty underwear makes fora really shitty band-aid.    Damn it...    So, I was wondering, do you knowabout this guy who att*cked, Avdol?    Indeed.    He is Soul Sacrifice.    A Native American shamanwho works as an assassin for hire.    He's a terrifying Stand user.    Mafias, militaries, politicians...    lowlifes the world over hire him.    I've seen his face only once.    And it was covered in scars!    Scars he receives by cunninglyprovoking his enemy to att*ck.    That's how he gainsthe "power of vengeance"    he uses to control his Stand.    That's why, to ordinary people,    it appears that a cursek*lled the victims.    So Polnareff has fallen into his trap?    I am very worried.    What kind of Stand is it?    No one knows for certain.    Those who've seen it are dead.    It's too dangerous forPolnareff to be alone.    Or any of us.    You're telling me this guy and his curse    have the power to k*ll us, one by one...    He'll be here in five minutes.    Let's all meet up in this room.    Got it. We'll see you inroom twelve-twelve soon, old man.    What was that all about, Jojo?    Let's go. Apparently we're in danger.    Now that's odd. I can't find my room key.    I could have sworn I set it here...    Damn it! Where is it?    Now how in the hellam I going to get back in here?    Could I tell the front deskand ask for a new one?    There's probably a fine for that.    There it is.    Must've fallen during all the commotion.    Wha...    What?    What's...    What the hell, shampoo? Damn it! My eyes!    Who's there?    Crap, this isn't good!    I'm a sitting duck under here!    Mr. Polnareff, this is room service.    I've brought you a first aid kit.    Get out of here! You'll be k*lled!    Huh? What in the world is going on here?    Get out of here!    I told you, you'll get yourself k*lled!    How dare you?    How dare you s*ab one of my eyes out,    Polnareff?    A doll? What kind of...    Silver Chariot!    Are you stupid?    Your Stand can't fight what you can't see!     EBONY DEVILSOUL SACRIFICE    Oh, Jojo.    Did you need something?    So you are here.    Listen up.You need to stay put for a while.    Huh?    I'll come for you later.    Don't open the door for any strangers.    Okay...    Damn it!    How heavy is this bed, anyway?    It's gotta be at leasta hundred twenty kilograms...    I've got to use Silver Chariot's sword    to cut through this cord...    You little bastard!    As soon as I stop attacking, this happens.    You better believe I'm gonnakeep blindly stabbing    every centimeter of this room!    You suck!    Looks like the big, scary knight    can't even pin the tail onthe donkey when he's blindfolded!    Those senses of yours...    are as dull as a butterknife!    Bastard...    I've just about had it with you...    You little runt!    It's just you two?    Why isn't the girl with you?    Well, we went to check on her...    She's not a Stand user;    Bringing her here would onlyplace her in more danger.    Suppose you're right.So that leaves Polnareff.    But man, he's so late...    It's been way over five minutes.    Let me out of here!    Gotcha!    Time to snap your spear in half.    All right. Damn it...    At least I'm finally freeof those cords...    I've got to get Chariot under the bed    and get the hell out of here.    Now what's he doing?    Huh?    Hey, Polnareff!    How'd you like it if I tooka bite out of your balls?    What an obscene little jerk.    Chariot!    Whoa, there.    Now to hide where he can't see me!    You numbskull!    Give that floor you're stuck toa good feel!    This is...    You're soaked in beer, juice, and alcohol!    I just put that well-stocked barto good use!    And if I had piss in me,    I would've soaked you with that too!    And now... what do you think I'm gonna do    with this hair dryerand your soggy self, Polnareff?    I'm not gonna dry you off!    Die!    Time to put an end to this curse...    Polnareff!    You're not the only onewho can break stuff!    How did you know precisely where I was?    I was on top of the bed!    I broke the mirror!    So I could see you hanging over the bed    clear as day from down here.    At last, we meet.    Whoa, there.    Hey, Soul Sacrifice.    I have a question.    I seek a man with two right hands.    How about you tell mewho that guy's Stand is?    You idiot!    No assassin worth a damn wouldever reveal his Stand's identity!    It only happens in the faceof certain death,    for him or his opponent!    To know a man's Stand,is to know his weakness!    Only you guys are dumb enough to do that!    If it wasn't for that mirror,I would've taken you out!    All right. Come at me then!    What's the matter?    Didn't you say you were going tobite off my balls or something?    Just try it, you vulgar little sh*t!    I'm gonna...    slice up everything except your balls!    Um, sir...    It seems you've been inthe bathroom for quite some time.    Are you all right?     SOUL SACRIFICE'S...     SOUL SACRIFICE'S... LAST MOMENTS     Polnareff, you're finally here.    You're not terribly punctual.    Okay, everyone, let's get right to it.    Let's come up with a planin case Soul Sacrifice att*cks.    I'm b*at...     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    Answer me!    Why was there a dead boy's bodyin your room?    And what about the dead bodyin the bathroom...    The two are connected, aren't they?    Answer me!    I have the right to remain silent.    So you finally decided to show up!I've been waiting.    I had the Speedwagon Foundationstrike a deal.     Polnareff should be released soon enough.     But that was cutting it close.     To think that the enemy's pursuitwould come so early on...     As long as Dio is usingJonathan Joestar's body as his own,     he'll be able to track Jotaro and me.     He won't leave us any time to rest.     But we can read his thoughtsjust as he reads ours.     Shall I go buy a camera?     That won't be necessary.     I can use my powers    even without a camera.    What?    Michael's still not here? Where's Michael?    This week's number three jumps upfive points from last week...    Gold prices have...    You look delicious, meow.    What?    The channels are changingas if the tv has a mind of its own!    It's looking for the right wordsamong the channels    to create a message...    for the ear, not the eye.    There...    ...is...    ...a...    There! It said, "There is a"!    ...trai...    ...tor...    ...among...    ...us...    What? What did it just...    I could be wrong, but I think it said,    "There is a traitor among us..."    -Ka...-...kyo...    -...in...-...Beware...    -...of...-...him...    -Di...-...o's...    -...ser...-...va...    -...nt...    Kakyoin? What?    Impossible. Kakyoin is Dio's servant?    This is...    Joseph Joestar,you're watching me, aren't you?    Dio!    He found us! Look out!    But that can't be true, can it?    You know as well as I do.    Hermit Purple saysKakyoin is working with Dio    and betraying us.    It can't be!    I still trust Kakyoin.    There must be a reason behind this.    But if he is indeed connected to Dio,    he could exterminate usin our sleep, at any moment.    He'd be Dio's very own Trojan Horse!    So then where is Kakyoin?    He's with Jotaro.    Hey, Jotaro.    Are you going to eat that cherry?    Hey, what are you doing, Kakyoin?They'll die!    Could he really be a traitor?    A back-breaker? Such a drastic move!    This is unforgivable, isn't it?

Ice cream is good,but this baby here...   chilled coconut juice,nothing in the world like it.   How bout it?   I guess we can try it.   Three then.   Thankya much. That'll be twelve dollars.   Hey, make it six dollars! Six dollars!   This should cover it.   Okay.   Enjoy!   I'll take that!   So you...   Thought you could just grab my wallet,   you disgusting piece of sh*t!   Huh?   I'll have you spewing blood!   Kakyoin!   Why, you...   vile little cockroach d*ck,   how dare you touch my wallet...   with the same grimy fingersthat wipe that filthy ass!   I can't let you get awaywith that, now can I?   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Hey! What are you doing, Kakyoin?   You'll k*ll the bastard.   Oh my God, a back-breaker?   Such a brutal move!   And he's using such filthy language...   It's not like him at all.   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Kakyoin!   I told you to cut it out!What are you, deaf?   Dammit, Kakyoin.   You're not right.   What the hell's gotten into you?   That hurt...   No need to push...   That man tried to steal my wallet.He committed a crime.   And criminals should be punished.   Tell me, am I wrong, Jotaro?   This guy...    What are you glaring at?    The look in your eyesis awfully hostile, Jotaro.   You couldn't possibly be thinkingabout ending our friendship   over a little tussle with a thief,now would you?   Look, a beetle.   -That's awesome!-A beetle? Where?   -There're four of them up there.-I see them!   -There're four of them up there.-So cool!   You're making way too muchout of this, Jojo.   I'm just having a bad day.   I'm so exhausted from the trip,it's put me in such a bad mood.   Just a bad mood, huh?   Seemed to me you felt pretty good.   The old man and Avdol   think it's a good ideafor us to head to India by train.   We leave tomorrow.   We'll take the cable car   to Singapore Station to reserve tickets.   Mr. Kakyoin...   Jojo's already gone.   Right. I'll catch up in just a second.   I guess you like coconut juicea whole lot, huh, Mr. Kakyoin?   Huh?   Was that a beet...   No. I must be imagining things.   It must have been a piece ofcoconut or something.   Oh yes. I do love coconuts.   What's up, half pint?   Uh, nothing.   Hey, Jotaro.   Are you going to eat that cherry?   If not, then hand it over already.   I'm starving.   Uh-oh! Better watch out, Jotaro!   Jojo!   Good one, huh?   I'm only playing with you,good ol' Jotaro.   Kakyoin... It's likehe's a totally different person!   That look again!   What's with all this hardcore glaring,   Jotaro, old pal?   Get in, Kakyoin.   The cable car just got here.   Now I told you to get in.   See, I've got your ticket right here.   I'm gonna knockyour crooked, possessed ass    right into that cable car!    What?    You're a bit off.    "Possessed" isn't quite the word.    This isn't Kakyoin!    You still haven't realizedmy body's been growing    this whole time, have you?    All right, who are you?    Is he a Stand?    But I was able to touch him just now...    Unless he's a StandI can strike with my own fists?    Jojo!    I can merge withany organic matter I consume.    I'm a Stand anyone can see and touch.    I'm Yellow Temperance,of the Temperance card.    Gaze upon my handsome face with envy!    Come on, Jotaro, old pal!    Take a look at your hand.    See that little bit of me?It latched on when you hit me.    But I'm warning you:    Touch it, and it'll go afteryour left hand, too.    You should save your left handfor picking your nose!    This Stand is a slow eater...    And the more it eats, the bigger it gets.    You'll never get it off!    Damn you...    Oraa!    What do you mean, "oraa"?    When I digest you,    I'll shove your own crapdown your measly throat!    This stuff burns.    You bastard...    Hey, is this Jojo's grandpa?He's in big trouble!    Anne? What's wrong?    It's Mr. Kakyoin...    Kakyoin?    So he has betrayed us?    Mr. Kakyoin's face split open!    But Mr. Kakyoin wasn't Mr. Kakyoin!    And...    Jojo got att*cked bysome weird slime on the cable car,    and it's eating his finger!    Calm down! Where are you right now?    The boarding area forthe cable cars at the trade center!    He's being att*cked!    Mr. Kakyoin is attacking Jojo!    Hurry and come back to the hotel...    Did someone say my name just now?    Where have you been?    Jojo left me behind,so I was sunbathing by the pool.    With your uniform on?    Yes, why not?    It's all right.We have the real one here with us!    Anne, that means your Kakyoin is...    a fake!    I've been telling you that!    Jojo!    Jojo just jumped out of the cable car!    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Good grief.    A Stand that fuses with flesh?    It's devouring my finger...    But first things first,I've gotta get this thing off me.    Worst case,I might have to chop off my finger.    Think you got away?    Sorry to burst your bubble, pal.    Now dig that earwax out ofyour ears and listen up, hotshot!    My Stand, Yellow Temperance,has no weaknesses.    You didn't escape.    I just have no need to chase you!    You're as good as dead!    This'll hurt like a sonf a bitch,but it's time to torch it off.    This...    It only made it grow!    That was a bad idea...    Damn.    Pardon the intrusion.    My, my. That's certainlya bizarre entrance.    Don't mind me.    Hey, there kid.    I'm gonna need to borrowyour popsicle for a sec.    Excuse me, young man!    What do you think you're doingwith that child?    This your kid?    No, he's not, but...    Then shut up and enjoy the ride.    Sorry, kid.    When we get to the bottom,I'll buy you a new one, okay?    'Kay.    If I can't burn it off...    That bastard!    Now it's forming needles anddigging deeper into my hand!    Come now! Nothing will work,not even fire and ice!    I told you, before, didn't I?You won't find a single weakness.    You're mine, you little sh*t!    You're...    Papa! The puppy! It got our puppy!    Bastard! You were waiting for mein this cable car, weren't you?    M-My precious Pocky!    Watch out! Don't pull him!    Let go!    I've come to put an end to you...    Jotaro, old pal!    Oraa!    Pretty fast! But...    I keep telling you,I don't have any weaknesses!    Are you even listening?    You dumbass redneck!    My Stand is armorthat can also absorb power.    A defensive wall that can also att*ck!    No matter how fast orhow strong you may be,    against Yellow Temperance,you are helpless!    You can't defeat me!    You can't survive unless, of course,    you take a cleaver to your right hand!    Do you understand?    You have no way of winning!    You're not getting out of this!    Not until you're digested!I'll eat you up!    Good grief.    You're right, you reallyhave no weaknesses.    Maybe you are the world's strongest,    and that's terrifying.    But I'll tell ya, we Kujo's...    No, I mean, we Joestar's...    we use strategy to fight our waypast any obstacle.    I still have one strategy left.    What?    And that's to...    And that's to...    ...run away!    What the hell?    You're in the middle of beingeaten alive, you dumbass!    My Stand's got a hold of youthat you can't escape,    and you say you'll run away?    When I said run away...    I meant into the water!    I can't breathe...    You let your Stand's guard downto take a breath, didn't you?    Your Stand may be invincible,    but if I butcher you,your Stand dies, too.    Do you understand?    Listen, I've had it up to here withthat cocky-ass mouth of yours.    You should know,    I'm the kind of guy whotakes these things to heart.    Oraa!    Please, stop...    I can't fight anymore, I'm through!    My nose is completely shattered.    They're going to have towire my jaw shut, too.    Dio paid me to do this.    I didn't plan on risking my lifeto go after you guys.    There! See?    I want something from you.    The other Stand users,I want all the info you got.    That's the one thing I can't talk about.    I do have some pride, you know.    I can't rat them out...    Well, okay then. That's honorable.    Oh, I remember now!    Death, The Empress, The Hanged Man,and The Emperor are after you!    So, what can they do?    I don't know.    No, honest! I really don't know!    Stand users never revealtheir abilities to each other.    If they did, they'd be exposingtheir weaknesses outright.    But I do know that some witchtaught Dio about Stands...    Her son is one of the fourcoming after you.    His name is Centerfold.    He's unmistakable becausehe has two right hands.    And his card is The Hanged Man.    He's the one who k*lledPolnareff's sister, right?    I've heard the occasional rumorabout his powers...    A mirror. Apparently, he uses a mirror.    I haven't actually seen it,    but Polnareff has no chance of winning.    He's dead meat.    I just noticed something, Jotaro...    Looks like I've still gotsome luck on my side.    See that drain over there?    The one with all the blue crawdads?    Take a real good look.    A manhole...    That teeny little drain    is hooked intothis manhole right beside me!    I'm gonna pull you in and trap you!    Now you can't att*ck me!    I guess what I told you aboutthe man with two right hands    will go to waste.    Jotaro Kujo!    Aren't I lucky to havethis drain pipe to slurp you into...    Man, am I lucky!    Time to power up with some crustaceans!    I'll mash you up    and turn you into jelly!    And when I do, Dio's gonna give mea hundred million dollars.    A few minutes of brawling with you,and I will be set for life!    Aren't I lucky,you ball-less little buttmunch!    Good grief.    When you're focused on everything else,    it's difficult to observe yourself.    You just don't get it.Your luck finally ran out.    Before, you got awaywith only a broken nose.    Now you'll be lucky if you haveany bones left to break!    He punched me with water...from inside the drain?    I was only kidding around, Mr. Jotaro!    I swear, I was just messing with ya!    Just a little prank.    Come on, don't tell meyou took that to heart?    You're not thinking of punching meany more, are you?    I'm seriously injured here...    My nose is broken and my jaw'sgonna have to be wired shut...    I've got nothing left to say to you.    You're way too pathetic    I'm done wasting my breath.     YELLOW TEMPERANCERUBBER SOUL    Good grief.    So we're finally on our way to India.    And the man with two right handsis called Centerfold...    By the way, where did Anne run off to?    She was hanging around Singapore Station    right before our train departed, but...    I'm sure it was time for herto meet her father.    That story about her dadsounded real fishy to me.    I bet she's a runaway!    But it is a bit lonely withoutthat little rugrat, right, Jojo?    It's eerie...    To think, a Stand coulddisguise himself as me.    Seems he had already turned intoyou by the time I left the hotel.    Jojo, are you going to eat that cherry?    Not to be greedy,but they are my favorite.    Could I have one?    Yeah, sure.    Thank you.    Hey, look, Jojo. Flamingos in flight.    Oh, good grief.    Jojo...    My wallet's already been stolen!    No, thank you!    Tip!    If you don't give me a tip,you won't go to heaven, Mister.    Hey! Don't put your nose on it!    Avdol! Is this India?    Yes! Isn't it a great country?
02x10 - The Emperor and the Hanged Man, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:31Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore...  So the Indian leg of our journeyis finally upon us...  But, well, I'm a little worried.  I've always heard Indiais the land of curry  and rampant disease.  I'm worried my stomach won'tbe able to handle the culture gap.  That assessment is rather distorted.  You needn't worry.  It is a beautiful countrywith wonderful people.   That I assure you.   Well, this is Calcutta. Let's get going.   Hey, give me a tip!   Let me carry that for you!   Want a tattoo? You're very pretty.   Need some anti-venom?It won't hurt your stomach.   Let me show you my hotel!   Calcutta, India.   In the   th century,its population reached    million.   Calcutta buzzes with a bustling energy   that will pull you inand never let you go!   -I stepped in a pile of cow sh*t!-I don't need any.   -Damn it!-I don't need any.   -Somebody's already stolen my wallet!-Seriously, thank you, but no!   Tip! Tip! Tip!   If you don't give me a tip,you won't go to heaven, sir.   Hey! Don't rub your noseall over my stuff!   Avdol! So this is India?   See? Great country, isn't it?   They're what make India great,don't you think?    EPISODE TEN: THE EMPERORAND THE HANGED MAN, PART ONE   Here, try this.   This is chai.   I think you'll find it to your liking.   Chai.   One of India's most popular drinks.   A sweet concoction of   black tea, sugar, ginger, and milk.   At last, a little peace.   Be patient with India.   Once you get used to it, you'll seehow wonderful this country is.   You know, I kinda like this place.It's pretty cool.   What, Jotaro? You can't be serious?   Talk about culture shock.   Guess I'll like itonce I get used to it, huh?   Well, I suppose people adapt totheir surroundings eventually.   Where's the john?   Right over there, sir.   Polnareff.   Yeah?   What do you want to eat?   Pick for me.   It'd better be something amazing.   Something gorgeous and sophisticated   that suits a Frenchman like moi.   Which means it doesn't matter.   Let's see, something he'll like...   Excuse me.   Pardon me, sir, one moment...   Huh?   If you could please use this.   What's this wooden stick for?   Hey.   That's a weird looking toilet,but at least it's clean.   A gentleman like myself simplycannot tolerate a dirty bathroom.   Sir, is something wrong?   Don't "Is something wrong?" me!   The toilet...   The toilet...   There's a pig in the toilet!   This kind of toilet is rare even in India.   The builders constructedthe pig pen down below   higher than they were supposed to.   So when the pigs gets hungry,they come up for more.   That's not what I'm aski...   No, wait, what?   You're telling me this pig's food is...   That's what it's there for?   As I mentioned, sir, use this.   Here...   See? Now you can do your businesswhile the pig's knocked down.   Our manager gets the pigto lick his buttocks   and always sings his praises.   He gets it so clean.   Please, take your time.   Wait! Don't leave me in here alone!   I don't think I could everget used to this...   Guess I'll hold ittill we get to the hotel.   Sorry to keep you waiting.   Crap.   Where is he?   Weird... I could've swornI saw someone out there.   Must've been my imagination.   Guess I shouldn't be surprised.   I mean, I did just see a pig in the john.   Of course I'd imaginea monster in the window.   So this is what they meanby culture shock here.   What?   What the hell?   I can see this damn thingonly in the mirror!    This must be the mirror StandJotaro was talking about.    This is not good.    This is so not good!    Silver Chariot!    Where'd that bastard go?    Damn it!    Stand!    Where's the user? Who is it?    The man with two right hands...    Too many people...    Damn it!    What's wrong, Polnareff?    What is this about?    If that...    If that was a Stand, then that means...    Then that means he's here!    Jotaro! It's the Stand useryou heard aboutâ    the one who uses the mirrors!    The bastard who k*lled my sister!    The scum who heartlessly trampled    my sister's life, soul, and dignity.    Finally... Finally we meet!    Are you sure it's him?    Mr. Joestar, I'll be travelingon my own from here on out.    What?    With my sister's m*rder*rfinally within reach,    I'll be damned if I'm going towait for him to come after me.    It would put me at a disadvantage,and that's just not my style.    I'll find him first and k*ll him!    But we don't even know what he looks like,    or what his Stand is.    He's got two right hands,that's enough for me!    And he knows I'm after him,    so he'll be on the defensive.    See ya.    Tough talk from a manwho's digging his own grave.    And that means?    Just as it sounds, my friend.    Are you trying to say I can't win?    Yes.    Can't you see?The enemy att*cked to isolate you!    I won't let you go it alone, Polnareff.    Listen. Let me make one thing clear:    I never once gave a damn about Dio.    I told you in Hong Kong I'd tag alongso I could get my revenge.    Mr. Joestar and Jotaro already know this.    I've been alone from the start!    I've always been fighting alone!    You selfish fool!    Did you forget that Dio brainwashed you?    Did you forget thathe's the root of all this?    You have no idea how it feelsto have your sister m*rder*d!    I heard the last time you met Dio,    you ran like a dog withhis tail between his legs!    A coward like you would neverunderstand why I need to do this!    What did you say?    Don't touch me.    You got lucky that dayyou b*at me in Hong Kong.    Enough with this lecturing!    How dare you...    Oh, did that offend you?    Don't forget...    I'm a hell of a lot more pissed offthan you right now!    You can just keep being yourself,    with your holierthan thou attitude, Avdol.    Why, you!    Mr. Joestar!    That's enough. Just let him go.    No one can stop him now.    I've lost all respect for him, that's all.    My impression of him was completely wrong.    I did indeed run in fear from him.    But I'm certain that foresightwill let us win.    Rushing in without thinkingwill get us all k*lled.    Oh?    Then I'll say this with certainty, too.    Your little divination will be wrong.    Time to get off.    I'm here to see a friend of mine.    You're on your own from here.    Please, make me your wife.    My life will belong to you.    Just say whatever you wish of me, my love.    Please, let me stay by your side forever.    Baby, don't be stupid.You're still sixteen.    I'm old enough to marry.    I love you.    Listen. I'm just a no-good drifter, baby.    I live each day like it's my last,and one day, it will be my last.    You have royal blood.    We can't have a fairy-tale marriage.    No matter how much we love each other.    Really?    So you do love me?    Yep. You're my one and only, hun.    That's exactly why...    It's 'cause I love youthat we can't marry.    You understand, don't you?    This breaks my heart just asmuch as it breaks yours.    But I'll come back to see you andhold you like this whenever I can.    That's enough to make me happy.    Yes...    So long. Love ya, darling.    You know, it's bad manners to eavesdrop.    You think I spend too much timeon romance, don't ya?    When you've got girls like her allover the world at your beck and call...    you've always got a partner, an ally.    They'd do anything for me,even throw away their own lives.    You are aware of how I work, aren't you,    Mr. Centerfold?    By the way, about this Polnareffof the Silver Chariot.    Seems he left the group andis looking for you on his own.    What do you wanna do?    He totally fell for your plan,hook, line, and sinker.    Shall we go and k*ll him first?    Let's go.    Between your Hanged Man and my Emperor,    I have no doubt we can k*ll 'em all.    HANGED MANCENTERFOLD    So he really did leave us after all.    What?    You've seen him?    You sure you saw a manwith two right hands?    Where?    Huh?    I don't understand. He was right there.    What?    There, he was with that man in the street.    The g*n is mightier than the sword.    Not bad, if I do say so myself.    Who the hell are you?    Hol Horse. That's what they call me.    I'm a Stand user,and my card is the Emperor.    I've been paid good moneyby Dio to rub you guys out.    Look here, cowboy, I don't givea rat's ass who you say you are.    Where's the man with two right hands?    That was rude.You asked who I am, so I answered.    Well, whatever.    I came here with that guy.    He's nearby.    What?    Where is he?     There's really no pointin your asking that.     I, Hol Horse, will havethe pleasure of snuffing you out.     Morons like you always talk trash,     and it always ends upthe other way around.     Oh? Was that funny?     Lord Dio had you pegged:     "Polnareff has the fatal habit ofunderestimating his opponents.     b*ating him into a corpsewon't be any trouble for you."    He was exactly right,so I couldn't help but laugh.    If I have to take you out to get to him,    then that's exactly what I'll do.    Bring it.    Ever heard of m*llitary chess?    The t*nk is stronger than the soldier,    and tanks are weak against mines.    See, it's pretty muchthe basics of battle.     My Emperor is stronger than you,so I thought I'd be a gentleman.     I'll fill you in on my Stand'sabilities before we fight.     The g*n is mightier than the sword.    Such a brilliant quote.    What are you trying to say, exactly?    That I have a Stand that sh**t.    And a sword simply can't b*at that.    So, what? A pea sh**t?    -Prepare to die!-Prepare to die!    You underestimated me, Polnareff!    And now, you're dead!    If I take off my armor...    I can knock down a b*llet!    What?    That's impossible! It bypassed my sword!    Oh crap!    The b*llet is also my Stand.    And that cocky attitudejust cost you your life!    Polnareff!    Wha... Avdol!    I came here becauseI was worried about you,    and what do I find?    Your ego will bethe end of you, Polnareff.    You were worried about me?    Damn you!You came here to lecture me again?    The enemy already knowseverything about you!    You said you're a loner,    but from now on,you can't win on your own!    What bad timing foran outsider to interfere.    Out of the way, Polnareff!The b*llet's coming back!    Magician's Red!    I'll melt it down!    Damn that Avdol!He went after Polnareff himself.    Where are you, Mr. Avdol? Polnareff?    I have a terrible feeling...    Hey, there's a weird fightgoing on over there.    The puddle...    What?    Mr. Avdol!    Man, today must be my day.    My g*n and Centerfold's mirrorare weak against Aldol's fire    I figured Avdol would bethe toughest one to k*ll.    Talk about luck!    Looks like no more threatsin this game of m*llitary chess!    Mr. Avdol!    He's just hurt...    It's just a minor wound.    See? He's going to start speaking...    He'll open his eyes in a moment.    Right, Mr. Avdol?    You're going to wake up, right?    Mr. Avdol, you gotta wake up!    Please! Mr. Avdol!    That seemed awfully easy.    It was too quick!    That's what he gets for lecturing people.    Look at him now.    What did you say, Polnareff?    Mr. Avdol was worried about you!    Who asked him for help?     He likes to meddlein other people's business,     but he's slow as hell, so they got him.    Guys like him just get in the way...    That's why I said I was going it alone.    You bastard...    He saved your life. How dare you...    I am sick of it!    Having people up and die on me...    Polnareff...    I'm so sick of it, you hear me!    He's got a bold face,and yet he d*ed so easily.    Come to think of it,she was really good at sobbing...    Your sister, that is.    Are you telling me to hold back?    Don't fall for the enemy's provocation!    Mr. Avdol told younot to fight by yourself!
02x11 - The Emperor and the Hanged Man, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:32For such a tough guy,he sure was easy to finish off.  Then again, the end is usuallya pretty sudden curtain call.   Most folks don't get a chanceto say "goodbye," you know.  Think of thatas a little parting wisdom...  Polnareff!  You can't let him get to you!  Do you still not get it?  Mr. Avdol told you!  He begged you not to fight alone!   But you ignored him...   He feared you'd gladly end your own life,   if it meant getting revenge!   Mr. Avdol followed you hereout of worry, and now he's gone!   So what am I supposed to do?   We need to fall back for now.   He mercilessly stabbed Avdol in the back.   He k*lled my defenseless sister.   You expect me to forgetall this happened and run?   We can't fight them when we don'tknow what their Stands can do!    Don't fight a battle that willonly end in your death!    That's what Mr. Avdolwas trying to tell you!   Hey! Come on, li'l Pol Pol.   Why, you...   Polnareff! Slowly retreat toward me.   We'll take that truck!   Calm down you say?   All ri...   Hey, Polnareff.    EPISODE   : THE EMPERORAND THE HANGED MAN, PART TWO    Avdol d*ed for you.   I think that means you owe him.   Your friend bit the dust, because of you.   You bastard.   Where's the user?   Polnareff, calm down!   No need to be sad. You should be happy...   You're about to seeyour dear friend again.   You'll soon be dead,   enjoying the afterlifewith those two fools.   Your sisterwas so very sweet, Polnareff...   Once you're reunited withyour sister, be sure to ask her:   exactly how I m*rder*d her!   Polnareff, don't fall for his tricks!   He wants you to att*ck!   Bastard!   Your Chariot cannot cut my Hanged Man.   I'm in the mirror,where your Stand can't go.   That's why!   So close, and yet so far away!   Hol Horse. Fire away.Let's put an end to this idiot.   Aye aye, sir.   Die!   Emerald Splash!   What the...   Wait? He sh*t...   ...Polnareff!   Kakyoin, was it? Not bad.   That's out of my Stand's range.   Even if I got him,   the b*llet wouldn't do much damage.   Mr. Centerfold went after them, eh?   He must really have it in for Polnareff.   Sorry, Kakyoin.   I...   I thought, so long as I couldavenge my sister,   I wouldn't care if I live or d*ed.   But I understand now...   I know Avdol was fighting for me.   His sacrifice won't be for naught.   I'll fight to keep on living.   You sure you really mean that?   Yes.   You can think of that asa makeup handshake, Polnareff.   Right. Thank you, Kakyoin.   When those bastards come after us again,   we'll defeat them together.   Avdol, you...   You know, I was so sureI stabbed him with my sword.   But it didn't connect.   It was like he wasn't there.   Breaking the mirror didn't stop him.   The Hanged Man,just att*cked from the shards.   He att*cks your reflectionfrom within the mirror.   My Stand can't go inside mirrors...   How can we att*ck him if he'sin some kind of mirror world?   Damn it!   Polnareff, you keep talking about   "inside the mirror"and "the mirror world,"   but there's no such thingas a world in a mirror.   Remember, this is reality, not fantasy.   What are you talking about?You saw it, too, didn't you?   You can see him only in a mirror,   and when you turn around, he's gone!   Yes.   But a mirror reflects light. Nothing more.   I know how a mirror works!   Listen! I mean in this case.Like what's going on right now.   If Stands can exist,then so can a mirror world!   Wrong.    Come on, man!    The secret of the Hanged Man    has something to do withthe way mirrors work.    Stands can defeat other Stands,    so there still has to be somethingwe don't know about hisâ    Polnareff!The chrome of the steering wheel!    What?    He's caught up to us!    Look out!    You all right, Kakyoin?    I slammed my chest, but I'll be fine.    What?    Chariot!    Kakyoin!Get away from anything reflective!    Damn it... I got it. I just saw him do it.    From mirror to mirror!    From reflection to reflection!    He's jumping from one object to another!    He traveled all this way    by reflecting over and over!    Reflecting?    So he's actually light!    A light-based Stand?    Kakyoin! I just saw himin the car's bumper!    He'll reflect off itand into something else.    Stay clear of reflective stuff!    And take off anything that's shiny!    Your buttons!    Hey, Mister, are you guys okay?    Want me to bring some medicine?    Hey! Kid! It's dangerous, Get out of here!    Whoa,you guy's really messed up your car...    Hey, you're bleeding, mister.    What?    Are you sure you're okay?    That assh*le!    He reflected into the kid's eye!    Listen, kid. Don't look at us.    Huh?    I told you, don't look at us!    Stop looking at me! sh*t!    Huh? But you're hurt.    I'm fine! See? Perfectly fine!    So go look over there!    You're bleeding...    Look over there, you brat!    Damn you, Centerfold!    What to do?    You wouldn't poke outthis cute little boy's eye    with that sword of yours,would you, Polnareff?    Polnareff!    I finally got you.    You won't escape this time.    Unless, of course,you gouge the kid's eye out.    You dirty little...    You'll pay for this!    Hey, Kakyoin.    That's not what you sayat a time like this.    Listen!    In times such as these,    exacting revenge requiresan altogether different battle cry.    My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.    For the honor of my sister's soul,    so that my friend Avdol may rest in peace,    into the pits of despair,    I shall strike you down, Centerfold!    Sorry bout this, kid!I'll buy you any candy you want!    You got sand in my eye!    Polnareff, he's in your eye...    I don't understand how,    but he moves at almost the speed of light.    A normally indiscernible speed, yes,    but I knew that if the kidclosed his eyes,    his next move would be to my eye.    I see...    The Hanged Man can existonly in the world of reflections.    When one world is about to be destroyed,    he must migrateto another reflective object.    So...    Knowing his pathmakes slicing through him...    a piece of cake!    That's where he is... The user!    You bastard. Finally...    Finally!    At last we meet...    Centerfold!    My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff,    and I've seen throughyour Stand's clever little trick.    It's a Stand of light that movesat extraordinary speed.    Too fast to target with my eyes.    But if I know where you're going,    and I slash its trajectory in that moment,    I can cut you!    If Kakyoin and Avdol hadn't shown up,    I probably wouldn't have figured that out,    and you would have k*lled me.    Polnareff! He's not the manwith two right hands!    That's not Centerfold!    What?    Polnareff!    EMPERORHOL HORSE    Polnareff!    Over here.    Insignificant fools!    I'm Centerfold.    You...    That's just some beggar from the village.    All I did was carve him up a bit,just like you did to me.    And you fell for it!    Getting close to him withoutknowing what I look like    was a grave mistake!    You bastard!    Take this! Emerald...    Whoa. Wait now.    Take a good look around you.    Hey, gather 'round!    These two gentleman are handing out money!    What?    They'll give us money for nothing!    Thank you!    You have such big hearts!    Thank you! Thank you!    Thank you!    Please give us money!    Have you figured out what's going on yet?    You say you've figured out my Stand?    Fool!    You think I don't know my own weakness?    With myriad reflective surfaces,you'll never know my next move.    I have no weakness!    Don't look! Don't stare at us!    Just look away!    There's no escape.    Just going to blow everyone up?    You wasted your youth chasing me...    And now, to come so far only to fail!    How pathetic and sad.    I, Centerfold,    will live on surrounded bybeauties like your sister    Oh the pleasures that await!    Oh yeah, that sweet sister of yourswas really good at sobbing...    Farewell.    Why, you...    Polnareff, you can do better than that.    When taking revenge,words like "Why, you..." won't do.    Here's what you say:    My name is Noriaki Kakyoin.    To avenge my dear friend, Avdol,    and so that the soul ofmy friend Polnareff's sister    may rest in peace,    I will have you pay with your life.    I'll give this gold cointo whoever picks it up.    Behold, a coin so perfect,it shines like a mirror!    Now I get it, Kakyoin.    Seems everyone's eyesare now focused on a single point.    Yeah.    We know the trajectorythe Hanged Man will have to take!    Merci, Kakyoin!    Now!    Hold it!    It won't open!    Sounds like you're the one who'sreally good at sobbing, Centerfold!    And you're about to plummet into hell,    crying the whole way down.    But there's one thing I can't relyon the guardians of hell to do.    And that's...    To turn your body into a pincushion!    I've been waiting years for this moment!    I'll leave the rest to the devil.    So this is the true Hanged Man...    He was rotten to the core.    I got my revenge.    HANGED MANCENTERFOLD    Hold it!    Finally caught up with you.    Why are you walking so slow?    If you're gonna run,run like your lives depend on it.    Right, Mr. Centerfold?    Better say your prayers.    This is where your lives come to an end!    Come at us with everything you've got!    Show us your guts, boys!    Right, Mr. Centerfold?    Hey, are you listening, Mr. Centerfold?    I don't thinkhe's listening anymore, cowboy.    He's a little busy right now...    Carrying out his sentence in hell!    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!    Don't try to pull that nonsense!Bluffing won't work on me!    There's no way you could have b*at him!    Even I wouldn't try my luckagainst that mother!    Polnareff,your sense of humor really stinks.    'Two, three hundred meters that way,    is that bastard's corpse...    'case you wanna look.    Don't mind if I do!    Hey! You're running away?    I don't stand a chance!    I'm outnumbered!    Time to hightail it out of hereand wait for a better chance!    Or better yet, wait 'til I findmyself another partner in crime.    It's all about being Number Two!    That's the motto I like to live by!    Got a problem with that?    What?    Mr. Joestar! Jotaro!    We know about Avdol.    We didn't have time for much,but we gave him a proper burial.    The one who stabbed Mr. Avdol in the back    was that coward with two right hands.    But the cause of deathwas Hol Horse's b*llet.    What should we do with him?    I'll give him his sentence.    Death!    What?    Please run, Sir Hol Horse!    -Sir Hol Horse!-What's with this woman?    I don't know what's going on,    but I do know I'll always protect you!    You are my everything, darling!    Please run! Hurry!    Let go of me, stupid bitch!    Come on, what are you doing?    Jotaro! Kakyoin!Don't let Hol Horse get away!    It's too late.    Huh? Oh...    Well said, my little sweetheart!    I'll gladly accept your feelingsand keep on living!    I'm only running awaybecause I love you, baby!    Forever and ever!    Why, you...    Get back here!    Agh...    Oh, don't you dare "Agh" at me!    Polnareff, the girl is justanother one of his victims.    And he no longer hadany intention of fighting with us.    We have no time to deal with him.    Avdol is gone now.    But we have to forge ahead.    It's already been fifteen dayssince we left Japan.    Damn it...    Fine then.    All right! We continue onward to Egypt.    Listen up! To defeat Dio,we have to fight as one.    We can't go off on our own!    Or we'll play right intothe enemy's hands.    Got it?    Let's get a move on!    Good grief.    The city of Varanasi is coming into view.    m*rder*r!    I am the culprit!    I am Joseph Joestar! An American!    What?    I love you.    Hey... Doesn't that sort oflook like a person's face?
02x12 - The EmpressQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:33My son has been m*rder*d...  I can sense the misfortune thathas befallen my son, Centerfold.  The bond between motherand son has spoken!  My precious, beautiful boy...  You d*ed covered with wounds like this?  I can feel it.I suffer the same pain you felt.  You were magnificent as you foughtfor LordDio, my dear Centerfold!  How...  How did they do it?   To k*ll such a nobleand pure soul like you...   They must have done something underhanded.   Damn them!   The bastards!   I will make sure they paya terrifying price   with the Empress card!   Move!   This is a time for action...   With the Stand that brings a slow death!   Oh, the anguish!   I shall k*ll them all!    VARANASI, CALCUTTAINDIA   Jojo and crew head tothe sacred city of Varanasi.   Listen...    I don't usually get ona soap box like this...   But stupid people are just that.   You can repeat something a million times,   and they still won't listen.   You know the type, right?   There's just no helping the poor souls.   But you know, uh...   I never got your name...   Nena.   Nena! That's a great name.   Daughter of that wealthy Varanasian family   from around here, right?   You're good-looking,and I can tell your smart, too.   I have an eye for people,which leads me to my point...   Hol Horse is a horrible, lying bastard.   He's manipulating you!Think how your parents would feel.   You hear me?   You can't end up like this.   I know it's easy when you're in love.   But you can't afford to seethe world with such a narrow view.   Take a step back andlook at the whole picture.   Hey, we're almost there.   The city of Varanasi.   The sacred river, the Ganges.   A place for holy men,the young and the old, the sick.   Where cows, dogs, monkeys,and food for human consumption,   lie alongside excrementand corpses for cremation...   The river embraces all,its waters ever flowing.   From birth unto death,   its holy waters form a microcosm of life.   Visitors of Varanasiare said to remain transfixed,   never wanting to leave.   Perhaps the landscape   that is this sacred landis a window unto soul.   Man... This thing isn'tgetting any better.   What's wrong, old man?You don't look so good.   Looks like my bug bite got infected.   It's definitely swollen.   I think you should see a doctorbefore it gets worse.   Hey, doesn't that sort oflook like a person's face?   Stop kidding around, Polnareff.   Sorry 'bout that.   Shall I go to the hospital with you?   No! Stop treating melike a feeble old man.   I'll just lance this.   Huh? What'd you say?   It's definitely infected.   It'll worsen, if we don't drain the fluid.   Hey, hey, hey.   Can't we just put medicine anda bandage on it, and call it a day?   Not to worry.   We'll numb the area, so it won't hurt.   No problem. No problem at all.   Come now, lie down.   I studied medicine in England.   I can do appendectomies, too.   Uh-oh. It's a little rusty.   Well, no problem.   All right.   Let's slice it open.   Come on!   I don't want to watch it being cut open.   No problem.   Hey, are you done?   Is it over yet?   What?   Hey, Doctor!   Trying to cut me open?   That's a pretty stupid move, you old fart!   What the hell is this?   I'm the Empress,   as in the Empress card, Old Man Joseph!   And now, I'm gonna bloody you up good!   When'd you get on me? Damn it!   This thing's got teeth!   Damn it's strong!    No, it grabbed the scalpel!    Oh, no!    Thank goodness it got my artificial hand.    Bastard! Think you can just cut me?    I'm part of your body now, Old Man Joseph.    You can't get away from me, honey.    Bet I can guess what's goingthrough that thick skull of yours...    Probably something like...    Only a Stand can defeat another Stand.    My Stand, Hermit Purple,has the power of clairvoyance    and remote viewing.    How can I fight with that?    How can I defeat somethingthat's growing out of my own arm?    You can't!    Where's the user?    How the hell did you infect me?    You moron! I won't tell!    Disgusting freak!    Running off to your friends?    We'll see how that goes.    Doctor, your next patient is waiting...    Doctor...!    Hey! Let me explain!    -I didn't do it, I...-I k*lled him!    I'm Joseph Joestar! An American!    And I'm staying at Hotel Clarks!    What?    By the way, girlie.    I have a thing forhot young nurses like yourself.    What?    m*rder*r!    Wait! You got it all wrong!    Oh, no...    Now you can't go back to the hotel.    You're all alone now!    I can k*ll you without anyone interfering!    You little...!    I'll crush you to tiny bits!    What?    Hey, this is your arm.    Take care of it, you shitty old man.    It grew arms? How much more could it grow?    Hey! Let go of it!    What are you doing? Let go!    Not a chance!    Officer! The m*rder's over here!    He's right here!    It's been a while since it came to this...    Hey! What are you doing?    Overdrive!    Moron!    It's your arm, remember?    You think your Hamon wouldwork against your own body?    You! Don't move!    Then how about...Hermit Purple!    You're crushing me...    I can use it this way, too!    I told you, freeze!    Stop! Criminal!    Damn it!    What are you doing? I can't see!    Now what?     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    So as I was saying, Nena...    Real men don't have to talk a big game.    That's how you figure out who's a liar    and who's the genuine article.    Damn cops've run mein the wrong direction.    I'm nowhere near the hotel now.    Had I known this would happen,    I would've taken Polnareff with me.    Instead of a petty guylike Hol Horse, how about me?    Am I not your type?    I don't dwell on the past.    I don't care whom you used to date.    What's important is the future.    We just need to understand each other.    Oh, look over there.    That place is a hotel run bya Japanese woman named Kumiko.    -She manages it-Out of the way.    -with her Indian husband.-Out of the way.    We could probably stay for cheap.    Oh, really?    Tell me more about this hotel.    Wha...    What the hell are you doing?    I'm eating, Joestar.    I've got to grow up big and strong.    You stole those at the market!You quick little bastard.    Why, you...    Look how big I've gotten!    It's tough having another mouthto feed isn't it, Daddy...    You disgusting little cow!    I'll show you that nobody...    has the experience or the smarts totake down the great Joseph Joestar!    Now how the hell am I going to do that?    Damn it...    Here goes nothing... Hermit Purple!    Oh, Daddy Dearest,    you know I appreciateall your tender loving care.    But you shouldn't tie your children down.    One day, you have tolet them leave the nest!    Oh, no!    It's no use.    I could use Hermit Purple'sremote viewing to find the User,    but I need a camera!    What can I do?    At this rate... it won't be just my arm.    She'll take over my entire body!    I've already grown enoughto end your pathetic life!    See? I can reach your throat.    I just have to bust your carotid artery,    and you're done for.    Oh, no!    What's he doing?    Bastard!    What in the...?    Look!    That man has a verystrange growth on his arm!    Dammit! Where the hell's the Stand user?    Polnareff, sir...    I need a reliable man like youto take care of me.    I love you... Such a strong,trustworthy man you are.    Uh, but it's all so sudden.    Is she serious?    I think I'm falling in love!    Lucky!    Hey, Joseph Joestar.    You idiot.    You getting farther and fartherfrom Jotaro and the others.    You think I'm running my ass offjust for the hell of it?    I'm running so I can shut you up for good!    See that?    You're going in for a nice long soak!    Senile old fool!    A nail?    I picked it up earlier.    When you were rolling aroundon the ground like an idiot.    Now I can cut shove itright into your carotid!    Did you actually believe I'd suffocate    if you stuck me in here?    Die!    I may be made of your flesh,but I'm not alive like you!    Forget the rules already?    Only a Stand can defeat a Stand.    Oh yeah,    weren't you going to show meall that fighting experience?    Am I supposed to be impressed?    You're nothing but a pathetic old man!    My prosthetic hand...    It almost broke when she hit it earlier...    It's got no power!    Just one more push...    Your life as an invalidis about to come to an end.    There's no way you can defeat me...    Huh?    Not a single way...    What?    Not a single what?    I'm sorry, my hearingisn't what it used to be.    Run that by me one more time, will ya?    Coal tar!    You stuck me in tar?    It wasn't to suffocate me!    You were trying to keep me from moving!    But...    How'd you know there wascoal tar in there?    With my Stand's power,Hermit Purple told me everything!    Hey, everyone look...    What is this?    That foreigner must've made itwhen he spilled the incense ashes...    They've formed a perfect map of the city!    You used psychic photography!    That's how you found the tar!    You "developed" a picture in the incense!    The difference in our fighting experience    should be as clear as day now!    When your opponent starts boastinghe's already lost.    That's how Joseph Joestar does things.    Like a fine wine,I guess I just get better with age.    Now...    It's time to rip off this Standwith my Stand!    Next you'll say,"Please, stop it, I beg you!"    Please, stop it, I beg you!    This will hurt me as much as it hurts you.    But children can't dependon their parents forever.    Once you've grown up,    you gotta learn to live on your own!    Now then...where's this thing's Stand user?    Well, then, Nena...    Shall we seal our new love with a kiss?    What? What? What the hell?    What's wrong, Nena?    So she was The Empress's Stand user...    Huh?    Huh?    This ugly troll...    attached her Stand to meas a tumor with a human face,    and camouflaged herselfas a beautiful woman.    You were careless.    She played you likea damn fiddle, Polnareff.    EMPRESS NENA    And here I thought we'd finallybe able to sleep in a bed.    If the old man hadn't screwed up,    we wouldn't be out herehiding from the cops.    I took care of things.    We can take this car.    Polnareff, you're driving.    Hey, don't tell me you're still in shock.    The Stand att*cked me, remember?    I'd rather have gone through that...    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    So, we're finally leaving India.    Well, I am a girl.    Did you see the driver's face?    More trouble would be especially bad now.    A truck? Impossible...    By the way...do you like sumo?
02x13 - Wheel of FortuneQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:33Now with a new set of wheels,  Jojo and crew leavethe holy city of Varanasi  for Pakistan.  We're about to hitthe Indo-Pakistani border...  I guess it's time tosay good bye to India.  You know, I had mixed feelingsabout the country at first,  but now I sorta miss the hustleand bustle of Calcutta,  and frenetic chaos of the Ganges.  One day, I'll be back.   I owe it to Avdolto give him a proper burial.   Mr. Avdol...   The road's getting narrower.   Quit clogging up the road! Outta the way!   I'm gonna pass him!   Polnareff, calm down!   This four-wheel drive is great!   Hey, did you just flinga bunch of rocks into that car?   Yeah? Your point?   Another incidentis the last thing we need right now.   I'm wanted becauseof what happened in Varanasi.   I'd like to cross the border in one piece.   What now, Polnareff?   I just told you!We can't afford another mishap!   I know that!Look who's standing over there!   Good grief...   Hey! We meet again.   How 'bout a ride?    I mean, come on, I'm a girl.    Soon I'll be wearing a bra,and doing my nails for the boys.   I'd look pathetic wandering aroundthe world when I'm that age.   It's now or never! The time is now!   To see the world... To be free...   Don't ya think?   Look, I feel bad for lying aboutgoing to see my dad in Singapore,   but let's just forget that.   Hey, it's the car we passed.   Guess he's in a hurry now.   Let him pass.   Yeah...   Hey, now!   What's he trying to do?   I let you pass,now hurry up and go already!   He's probably mad fromyour little maneuver earlier.   Catch the driver's face?   Nope... Windows were covered in dust.   Couldn't see a thing.   Me neither...   It couldn't be...   Be careful, Polnareff.   Now he wants me to pass!   Looks like he realizedhow shitty that piece of junk is.   Should've just stayed behind me, dumbass!   What?   A truck? No!   We're stuck! We're gonna crash!   Star Platinum!   That was close!   Without Star Platinum,we'd have been toast.   He's gone! Where'd that blasted car go?   Looks like he drove off.   What do you think?   Think that bastard in the caris an enemy Stand user?   Or some sick bastard with an axe to grind?   Of course he's one of Dio's lackeys!   We were almost road k*ll, for God's sake!   But he didn't att*ck withanything that resembled a Stand.   Regardless,we have to keep heading to the border.   If we see that car again,we'll take him out, whoever he is!   Damn straight.   What should we do about that truck?   Star Platinum left it a wreck.It won't be going anywhere.   We pretend we never saw it.Now let's get going.   He's so cool... and dreamy...    SYRIA   A roadside tea stand...   A break would do us some good.   If we stick around here a while,we should lose that crazy driver.   What is that stuff?   Sugarcane juice.   Care for a glass?   Might as well...   What?   It's him!   That car's here!   You! I've got a question!   The driver of that clunker over there...   Who is it?   Um, I'm not sure, sir.I didn't notice it there, sir...   Our driver won't just come outand announce it.   He's messing with us!   Then I guess that leaves uswith one option. Right, Jotaro?   Yeah...   Poor innocent bastards...   We'll just have to b*at them all down!   Hey, Jotaro, stop!   Mr. Joestar, not you too? This is crazy!   Pretty suspicious mug you got there...   What? Not me!   Slippery bastard just playedthe lot of us, didn't he?    Anyone see his face?    No. What is he trying to do?    He could be some madman with a car,or he could be trying to k*ll us.    I won't rest until I catch himand get to the bottom of this!    And I'm still pissedabout what that truck did to us!    Damn it! For a piece of junk,that car can really get up and go!    That's strange.    According to the map,    we should be running parallelwith train tracks here.    Who the hell cares?    We'll catch up soon anyway.    That bastard!    I'm gonna nail himonce we round this curve!    A dead end! That's impossible!    Where the hell did he go? He's gone!    It's like he just disappeared!    There's no way he crossedthe suspension bridge...    What?    It's him!    He keeps ramming us!    How'd he get behind us?    How much horsepower isthat piece of junk running with?    It's like a t*nk!    It's no use! Everyone, get out of the car!    Polnareff!    You can't get out untilthe rest of us are clear first!    Who'll hold down the brake?    Huh?    Sorry!    Hierophant Green!    Stop!    Hierophant can't supportthis kind of weight!    You'll be torn to shreds!    Mr. Joestar, with all due respect,I am aware of my own abilities.    I am not a fool.    You took the winch with you!    Not bad, Kakyoin.    So tell me, you like sumo?    Especially deadlocksat the edge of the ring...?    Exciting, isn't it?    Ow...    Yeah, I'm a fan of sumo.    But Jotaro, it's against the rulesto punch your opponent.     STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Nothing here suggestshe used a Stand att*ck.    I think it's safe to sayhe's just some weirdo.    Yeah. Either way,he's a goner after that fall.    Well... What goes around comes around.    Yeah, but I still wonder...    How'd it get behind us?    It's so strange.    It's not strange at all...    The radio!    He's coming through the AM/FM!    It was able to do thatbecause it's my Stand, Joestar!    What?    If he knows my name,    then he's got to be an enemy Stand user!    Where is he?    He's sending a signalfrom the car down there?    No way! You see that wreck?    No. That old jalopycould very well be a Stand.    Remember the boat Stand?This could be just like Strength.    Behold the Wheel of Fortune...    My Stand will lead you to your maker!    The Wheel of Fortune?    What the... An earthquake?    I've got a bad feeling...    Everyone, get in the car!    No, don't!    Don't go anywhere near it!    Couldn't be...    Below us!    Impossible! It burrowed upthrough the ground!    If that's not proof enoughthe car's a Stand, nothing is!    The Stand's user must be inside!    What the hell?    What is that thing?    It's like it's alive!    It's transforming for an att*ck!    Want to see who's stronger?    Don't, Jotaro. Don't fight it yet!    Not until we knowwhat that Stand's power is!    Jotaro!    Impossible... I couldn't see it.    The hell'd he sh**t at me?    Don't know what hit ya, eh?    You'll figure it out soon enough...    The moment you croak, that is!    Jotaro!    Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!    The hell is this?    They're not deep,but they sting like hell!    I couldn't see it.    He's sh**ting something at us,but our wounds...    I don't see anything in our wounds!    Are you all right, Jotaro?    Don't worry bout me. First things first...    I don't know what he's sh**ting,but he's got damn good aim.    I'll pulverize your legsso you can't move,    then run you over!    Quick! Between the rocks!    Stop skittering away, cowards!    -What?-What are you? Roaches?    Oh no! He's digging his way through!    We're no match for him in here!    He's like an insanemeathead who's lost control    cause he couldn't figure outsome kiddie puzzle!    Keep running!    They all left me behind!    So I'm a runaway!    So I'm a good-for-nothing kid!No one loves me! I'm always alone!    I'm gonna die!    Good grief.    If you have time to say all that crap,    you can run away, little brat.    I love you so much, Jotaro!    Go ahead and climb!    There's no path left for you to take!    No way to escape,no way to survive, no way to Egypt,    and last but not least, no future!    Because...    This Wheel of Fortune    is going to grind you into mincemeat    and splatter you all over these boulders!    Oh, no!    It's climbing up...    Is there anything this car can't do?    Good grief.    Guess we have no choice but to fight.    Everyone, get back.    Once he climbs up here,his undercarriage'll be exposed.    We'll see how strong it is then.    I get it.    Its undersidemight be vulnerable to att*ck!    You're pretty fast there, Jotaro!    But not too bright!    Your bodies reek,and you haven't even noticed!    Come to think of it,I think I did smell gasoline!    It's coming from us!    We're covered in gas!    It was sh**ting...    gasoline!    It was sh**ting small amounts of itat high speed, like b*ll*ts.    Incredible...    He wasn't trying to wound us.    He was dousing our bodies with gasoline!    Looks like you finally caught on,but it's too late!    Now all you need is a little jolt!    What?    Jotaro!    Jotaro!    Mr. Joestar, stay back!    We're soaked with gasoline, too.    Jotaro!    I win! Part Three ends here!    Oh?    Then who'll be taking the placeof the one and only Jotaro Kujo?    Don't tell me you think it'd be you.    You burrowed into the groundwith Star Platinum!    So the only thing that b*rned upwas your jacket?    A little parting wisdom:What you said earlier about paths...    was dead wrong.    You see, in life,you have to forge your own path.    Let Jotaro Kujo show you how it's done.    All you need is a little push!    I'm being crushed...    Jotaro!    And that's how it's done.    Your body paved a nice path.    You literally made a road with it.    Here ends the lesson.    What an odd fellow.    His arms are the size of boulders,    and yet everything else is so small.    Talk about a bluff.    Hey! Going somewhere?    Don't k*ll me!I'm just in this for the money!    Oh, God.    I can't believe the Stand wasdisguising such a small car.    Kind of reminds me of    a fluffy little sheepthat's just been shorn.    How pathetic.    I AM A MONK IN THE MIDSTOF SPIRITUAL TRAINING.     RESPECT MY ASCETIC PRACTICEBY NOT UNDOING MY RESTRAINTS    Well, then. Let's take this caracross the border.    Only fair since he smashed ours.    It's pretty b*at-up.I wonder if it'll last that long.    Help!    And you're on the next flightto Hong Kong.    Aw, why?    Shut up! You're in the way,don't you get it?    We might not make it that far...    Help!     WHEEL OF FORTUNEZII ZII    My seven assassins have all been defeated.    The shame!    I cannot bear to face Lord Dio.    Curses! That despicable Polnareff!Kakyoin!    Curse Jotaro and his wretched grandfather!    I, Enyaba, shall be your nextand final opponent!    I will fight with my own Stand,the Justice card!    The fog is getting worse from over there.    They d*ed with that look of fearon their face!    Why is that?    What is with everyone in this town?    This isn't an ordinary m*rder.    Joestar and company.    You seem to be travelers.    Assalam alaikum.
02x14 - Justice, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:34Oh my, that looks quite good on you!  In all my years,  I've never received sucha strange request for clothing.  I'm in a hurry. What's the total?  See ya.  Uh, thank you, sir...  Let go! Let go of me!  And don't you dare touch me there!  -Shut up! Don't say it like that!-Here's her ticket.   No! I don't wanna!   I'm going with you guys!   Listen, Little Miss.   My daughter, Jotaro's mother...   is in grave danger at the moment.   We're on this journeyto save my daughter's life.   Forget this running away business,and start heading home.   I'm sure your parents are worried sick.   There.   Fine, I guess so.   I'll make you look goodthis time, Grandpa.   What's the matter?   Nothing.   See ya! Life is justa bunch of goodbyes anyway!   I do sort of wish I could'veseen him once more.   Goodbye, Jojo! You better save your mom!   I'll be rooting for you!   Pakistan is a young country,established in        following its separation from India.   But when Japan was stilla hunter-gatherer society,   Pakistan was the seatof a highly developed civilization.   Here in Pakistan, the people carry on   the     -year historyof the Indian subcontinent.    EPISODE   : JUSTICE, PART ONE    I gotta say, Jotaro, I'm impressed you got   a Japanese school uniformmade here in Pakistan.   The fit is perfect, too.   It's    % wool.   Polnareff, are you ok driving?   The fog seems to be thickening.   Yeah, I guess it is kinda dangerous.   With no guard rail on this cliffand all...   Hmm...The fog looks even thicker up ahead.   It's not even  :   yet,but I guess we have no choice.   Let's stop in that town for the night.   I wonder if they've got nice hotels.   A nice hotel, huh?   Right. And it'd better havea decent bathroom!   I still can't get used to those toilets   in India and Western Asia.   Was that a dead dog?   What's the matter, Jotaro?   Oh, it was nothing.   Not a bad town.   There must be at leasta few thousand people living here.   Let's ask about a hotelat that restaurant there.   But there's a weird quietabout this place...   Every other place has beenso crowded and noisy.   It's probably the fog.   Listen up, men.   In the Islamic countries west of Pakistan,   this is how you greet people.   First, you smile and say...   A-Salaam-Alaikum!   Um, hehe... No need toclose up shop just for us.   We just wanted to ask a question.Are there any hotels here in town?   Anybody home?   I do not know.   Huh?   Hey, wait a minute.Whaddya mean, you don't know?   What's with that guy...?   I must've been seeing things.   I'm sure he couldn't understand you   because your pronunciation's so bad.   Let's ask the guy over there.   Sorry, but we're looking fora hotel around here.   Preferably a hotelwith nice, clean bathrooms.   Do you know any...   Hey, you!   What's wrong?   What?   He's dead! His face is frozen in fear!   What's going on?   Why is he lying dead in the road?   What could've k*lled him?   A heart att*ck? A stroke?   It's possible...   But what we've got hereis no ordinary heart failure.   A g*n! This guy is holding a g*n...   You just noticed?   It's still smoking. He just fired it.   He must've just fired it.Maybe two to five minutes ago.   Either way, it must've beenright before we arrived in town.   Could it be su1c1de?Think he sh*t himself?   No, I doubt it.   His body doesn't seem to haveany visible wounds...   and there's no blood anywhere.   Then how'd this guy die? Look at him!   His face is all twisted,   like he was screaming in utter terror!    I don't know.    Exactly who or what did this mansh**t at with this g*n?    What happened?    Didn't anyone in town noticewhat was happening?    Excuse me, ma'am.    Someone has d*ed here!Please call the police!    You must excuse me.    My boils, they are infected.    Did you say you need something?    I asked you to call the police!    The police?    But why?    Look! That man's dead!    Oh dear, someone is dead you say?    Is there anything I can do?    I already asked you to call the police!    Yes, yes, call the police...    Of course.    My boils are infected.    They are so itchy. So terribly itchy...    What is with the people in this town?    A man is lying dead in the street,    and nobody seemsthe slightest bit concerned.    There was a g*nsh*t, and no one noticed?    These people are more oblivious thanthe most jaded New Yorker or Tokyoite.    That dog...    This blasted fog just keepsgetting thicker and thicker.    It's almost as if the fog hasswallowed the town whole.    This's really creepy.    Doesn't that part there look like a skull?    What do you want to do, old man?    You don't think it's the workof another Stand user, do you?    Probably not. There's no motive.    Would someone who's after us    k*ll a man who has nothing to do with us,    before we even got here?    There's no reason fora Stand user to k*ll him.    Who knows...He obviously d*ed unnaturally.    We can examine the bodybefore the police come.    Just don't touch it.    Right...    Looks like he was traveling, too,just like us.    He has bus and train tickets.    And he looks like he might be Indian.    He's carrying Indian money.    I'm guessing he's not from this town.    Oh?    A wound!    There's an opening the size ofa ten-yen coin under his throat!    This must be what k*lled him.    But why isn't there any blood?    With a wound this large,blood should be everywhere.    Normally, at least.    This is no ordinary m*rder.    We've got to get to the bottom of this.    But first things first.    Take off his clothes.    What happened to his body?    It's riddled with holes!    He looks like the cartoon cheeseon Tom & Jerry!    And there's not a drop of bloodnear any of these wounds.    How do you even k*ll someone like that?    What does all this mean?    Be careful.    If there wasn't a Stand user here before,you can bet there's one here now.    Everyone!    Get in the car!We're leaving this place now!    What?    Impossible!    This isn't the car!    Hermit Purple!    Hey. Old man.    What in the hell are you doing?You've lost it?    Oh, no!    What am I doing?    The car was right here just a minute ago!    What? The car?    We just parked over there.    What?    But just now...    I see you are travelers.    I'm afraid with this fog,    it's too dangerous to leave town now.    We have many cliffs, you know.    I run my own bed and breakfast.    If you'd like,why not stay there for the night?    I'll even give you a healthy discount.    Finally, a normal person!     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    We must assume a Stand useris hiding somewhere in this town.    This fog puts usat a significant disadvantage.    We cannot let our guard down tonight.    I realize no one's att*cked us yet,but, damn, this town is creepy.    Come on, this way, Master Joestar.That's my hotel.    Follow me,and I'll lead you to your rooms.    I know it doesn't look like much...but twenty years ago,    one of the     movies was filmed here,    and John Lennon from the Beatlesonce stayed here as well.    What? Seriously?    No, I was just pulling your leg.    -What?-Still,    it is quite a nice hotel,if I do say so myself.    We don't have any other guestsat the moment,    so you can choose the dinner menu.    Care for meat?    -Or would you prefer fish?-Hold it, Grandma.    You called me "Joestar," didn't you?    How'd you know that name?    Come now,    that young man beside you said"Mr. Joestar" earlier.    What? Me?    Now that I think about it, maybe I did.    Yes, you did, sir.    When you've been in this businessfor as many years as I have,    you learn to memorizepeople's names quickly.    So I'm sure of it.    By the way, Ma'am,what happened to your left hand?    Oh, this? It's just a little burn...    It must be my old age.    I accidentally spilledboiling water on it.    Old age? Don't be silly.    You hardly look a day over forty.    I should ask you on a date.    Don't tease an old woman now.    You damn, babbling, pathetic fool!    It is you I despise most, Polnareff!    I'll make sure you suffer a pain    a thousand times worsethan what my son endured.    Then I'll cut off your d*ck    and rip out your guts to finish you off!    Oh, this doesn't look bad at all.    Here, Kakyoin.    Right.    My autograph's worth    as much as Lennon's.I'm Paul-nareff, after all!    Make sure you take good care of it.    My, my...    I will do just that.    To commemorate the day I m*rder you!    It's done.    Well, then...Allow me to show you to your rooms.    Man... Talk about a weird town.    Now, time to hit the loo.    It must be broken.    Then I won't be able to use Hermit Purple    to get info on the enemy...    Hey, Mr. Joestar.    What's the matter?    Does this room have a bathroom?    Looks like mine doesn't have one.    Perhaps the bathrooms here are communal.    Ah, of course!    Good grief. He's so carefree.    A Stand user could att*ck at any moment...    So, the Joestar partyis on the third floor?    Hol Horse... So, you've come.    Yeah, I finally tracked those bastards    as far as this creepy town.    But finding you is a surprise, Enyaba.    I didn't expect youto fight them yourself.    What's the matter, Enyaba?    Why're you crying?    I'm just happy, Hol Horse!    It means so much that you're here!    Thank you for comingto see this lonely old woman!    It is so wonderful to finally see you!    Hol Horse, you and my sonwere friends, were you not?    Friends?    Uh, well, I...    Ahem...    Yes, we were thick as thieves.    So you were close?    Close?    Yeah, he was a dear friendand an excellent partner!    What's all this about?You're not acting like yourself.    Will you avenge my son?Is that why you're here?    Yes! That's exactly it!    I'm gonna make sure those bastardspay for k*lling my best friend!    That's exactly what I want to hear!    Because now I can k*ll you too!    Enyaba? What the hell are you doing?    How dare you, Hol Horse?    You abandoned my sonand left him for dead!    I swore I would k*ll youthe moment I saw you again!    His "best friend"? How dare you?    Wait! You've got it all wrong!    By the time I got there,Centerfold was already a goner!    You wretch! You're as unforgivableas that bastard, Polnareff!    I'll have you die at the handsof my Stand, Justice!    Justice?    I'm sure you heard rumors,but I doubt you've ever seen it!    I shall show you right now, Hol Horse!    What the hell is happeningto the blood in my arm?    It's like it's evaporating...    It made such a fine wound!    That's right!My Stand, Justice, is made of fog.    Any wound my Stand happens to grazebecomes a gaping hole.    And then...    Justice wants to dance!    My Stand's fog has enteredyour arm like a string!    And now, you're my puppet!    You will die by your own hand, Hol Horse!    You shouldn't get so damn cocky!    Emperor!    Die, you crazy old hag!    Justice prevails!    What the hell was that noise?    It came from the room behind the lobby...    Is something wrong, Polnareff?    I thought I heard a strange noise.    I'm going to take a look downstairs.    I'll be in the lobby.Call me if you need anything.    Curse you, Polnareff!    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    I just saw him. He's in the bathroom.    Oh, the bathroom?    The bathroom is just past that door.    I thought I just heardsomeone say "toilet."    I always seem to get att*ckedin bathrooms...

To avenge my dear son,I shall rip out your insides!  -Hey, Madame!-But I can't let him find  Hol Horse's body.  She's not behind the counter, either.  It'll be even worseif the other three show up.  I have to k*ll them one by one, damn it!  Stay back! Stay away!   Oh Madame, are you here?   I thought I heard some kind of crash.   Is everything okay?   I'm coming in, Madame.   Whoa!   Ow, ow, ow, ow...   Oh no, what happened?   Oh, it's nothing.   Only a tiny fall.Just bruised my hip a bit.   You fell?   You can't be falling now.   And you b*rned your left hand, too.   You're being much, much too careless.   Oh, thank you, dear boy.I'm fine. It's nothing.   No problem, I promise.   Get out!   Who said you could come in here, damn it?   I'll spare you my wrath for now...   But when the time is right,   I'll k*ll you just like I k*lledthat bastard, Hol Horse!   All it takes is just a tiny wound...   I'll turn you intomy very own puppet of Justice!   There we go...Here's your cane.   What's wrong? You're sweating b*ll*ts.   It's nothing. Don't worry about me.   Just go to your room and get some rest.   Well, if you insist.   But are you running this hotelall by yourself?   Don't you have some family around?   Like a son?   Huh? Sorry, did you say something?   Uh, I was just sayingI've gotten used to living alone.   I see...   Sounds lonely to me.   Just think, life with a sonand daughter-in-law...   Your grandkids couldrun around and play in the lobby.   It'd be a little noisy, but...   That's what makes families great!   If you had a son, he'd probablybe older than me, right?   Hey, what's the matter?   Did he move to the big city or something?   No. He passed away.   Oh, I'm so sorry.How terribly insensitive of me...   You're the one who k*lled him,you monster!   I'll slaughter you!   Please, sit down and rest.   I'll give you a nice back rub.   I know how it feels to be alone.   I lost my mom when I was still just a kid.   Ah, those were the good old dayswith Mom...   Tonight,   just think of meas if I'm your own beloved son...   Ask me for anything, all right?   You rotten little brat!   I should just k*ll youright now, you fool!   Wow, you're really tense.   I guess living alonehas been really tough on you.   What's that guy doing here?   Hol Horse? How is he still alive?   That miscreant must havemade his Stand disappear   as soon as it sh*t the b*lletinto his mouth!   That face!   Polnareff! Behind you...   No way! You're Hol Horse!   What are you doing?   Quiet! I'm the mother of Centerfoldwhom you mercilessly m*rder*d!   Chariot!   So, you're the Stand user?   Dare play a part in murdering my boy,   and I'll make sure you pay for it!   Mr. Joestar!   It's too late.   Your trusty friends will neverhear your cries, my dear.   Because...   I've summoned my own allies.   Who the hell are you guys?   Wait, it's you...   You're that dead guy we foundwhen we got to this town...   You're the traveler from India!   We've got zombies!   Behold the terrifying powerof my Stand, Justice!   Stand users can have only one Stand,   but Justice, the fog Stand,   can transform the deadinto my personal army!   It can control hundreds of corpses,even thousands of them!   Aren't you taking this grudgea bit too far?   To think that such a twistedStand user was after us...   This whole god-forsaken town'sgot it in for you!   And if you get a wound,she'll turn you into her puppet...   I need only to give you a little scratch.    It doesn't take much, you know.    Then my Stand, Justice,will take care of the rest!    Get him!    I'm outta here!    Polnareff! Don't leave me here, please!    Oh, shut up! Did you forgetwhat you did to Avdol?    Why should I save you?    You're on your own, pal!    You can't escape, Polnareff!    I'll yank your brain out!    I'll snap your spine in half!    I'll crush your balls till they pop!    My vengeance comes now!    She's psychotic!    How can an old crone like her run so fast?    Take this!    Damn! He ran into the back room!    After him! Break down that door at once!    Just my luck...    This hallway leads down to the basement.    Mr. Joestar and the otherswill never hear me.    I'm too far away from them now!    I don't think those thingscan b*at me, but...    if I get even a single scratch,I'm in trouble.    She'll open up the wound, and control me.    Damn it... Is there no way out?    Of course the windowshave iron bars on them!    sh*t...    I'll hide in this room.    Crap, they broke down the door...    At this rate,I'm going to have to fight them.    I just have to make sureI don't get even a tiny cut.    Now they're coming down the hallway.    They must be checking every room.    Damn it,they're getting closer and closer.    Oh come on...    Did I run into another bathroom?    Why am I always gettingambushed in bathrooms?    Damn it, the toilet is so dirty...    All right, just try it.    But the second you walk in,    my Chariot will chop upfour of you in a single breath.    What?    Now it's totally quiet out there.    Damn zombies... That old hag...    What the hell are they doing?    Aren't they going to break down the door?    What's taking them so long?    Come on, do something, damn it!    They were looking through the keyhole!    What the hell?    sh*t...    The bastard stabbed me in the tongue!    Perfect! You've finally fallenunder my Justice's control!    You shitty little brat!    Now if you don't open that doorand come out,    I'll split your face openas I pull you through the keyhole,    you fool!    Laugh now!    How pitiful, Polnareff.    Very pitiful, indeed!    My son, Centerfold,    d*ed in unimaginable agonythanks to your cowardice.    This isn't even closeto the t*rture you put him through!    Now then... How aboutwe have you clean the bathroom,    Polnareff?    Lick the toiletuntil it sparkles like new.    Don't be shy!    Lick it till it's shiny...    Like this!    Anything but that...    Anything but that!    Oh, God, help me...    Oh, you startled me.    You must learn how to knock, young man...    What can I do for you?    I'm here looking for Polnareff.    And I did knock.    Maybe you didn't hear me    because you were too busydoing something else,    grandma.    JUSTICEENYABA    I'm looking for Polnareff.    Seen him, grandma?    Damn! Now what?    Unlike Polnareff, this Jotaro is clever.    He must be questioning meto see if I cr*ck.    Playing dumb will justmake him more suspicious.    Troublesome brat!    I'll just tell him the truth,    and the moment he turns his back,I'll skewer him with these!    Then he'll be easy pickingsfor my Justice.    Why, yes, I do know.    I know exactly whereMr. Polnareff is, Mr. Jotaro.    Oh?    Crap... Jotaro has no idea.    Even a tiny scratch and it's curtains!    Stay back! Tell Mr. Joestar and Kakyoin!    That hag is the enemy!    He was just here.    He's in the bathroom now, Mr. Jotaro.    Of course he is. Through this door here?    Yes, that's right.    Just go through that door,    and it's the last doorat the end of the hall.    Incompetent fool!You are a child, after all!    Murdering Polnareffwill delight my son's soul!    And spilling your blood, Jotaro,    will send Lord Dio in Egyptinto jubilation!    Oh, right.    I almost forgot...    Oh? What's the matter, grandma?    Trip on something?    That was too close...    That was close.    You shouldn't hold scissors like that...    Good thing you weren't hurt.    You're pretty damn lucky.    Sorry to ask before you even get up,but I have a few more questions.    Why did you just call me Jotaro?    I never told you my name,    and no one has called me by my name.    I find that strange.    Well, come on, tell me.    Maybe it's because I watchedColumbo as a kid,    but it's little details like thatthat keep me up at night.    You're beginning to hurtthis old lady's feelings.    It's the guestbook!    You wrote your name in the guestbook!    It's so dry.    You wrote "Jotaro Kujo."    Oh?    Then I guess you mean this guestbook here?    Yes, that's it!    "Qtaro Kujo"?    "Jotaro" isn't written anywhere.    I was onto you when you said"Joestar" the first time we met.    I told the others not to use my name.    And yet, you know it.Which could only mean...    Cut the crap!    I already knowyou're the Stand user after us, old hag.    What's the matter now?    Aren't you going to show meyour Stand and fight?    You're looking right at it!    My Stand, Justice, always prevails!    All it needs is a scratch!Just a tiny scrape!    You've fallen into my trap, Jotaro!    Polnareff!    Jotaro, it's me, Hol Horse!    Enyaba's Stand is made of fog.    It'll split your wound right openand control you,    like she did with me!    It'll even control corpses!    Can it, Hol Horse!    Can you punch the fog with your fist?    Or cut the fog with your sword?    Or sh**t it with your g*n?    Absolutely futile!    There's nothing you can do,but accept your fate!    It's the biggest, toughest Stand there is!    Our puny Stands are no match for it.    Nothing stands a chance against Justice!    Lovely, keep it coming.    Your fearful praise is music to my ears.    Now I'll control you, too, Jotaro!    Run, Jotaro!She'll put a hole in your leg!    Good grief.    I don't need to run.    Before that old hag takes another breath,    I'll defeat that Stand.    Huh? What was that?    Before I do what?You rotten little sh*t head!    Before I take another breath,is that right?    Well, I'll do that...    I'll do that right...    What...?    Jotaro's Star Platinum issucking in Justice's fog headfirst!    Please stop...    ...and he's holding it in!    He's suffocating that bitch!    Well, now...    Looks like her head is in a bit of a fog.    I'm so angry...!    "What have I been licking"?What's it matter?    What a stupid question!    Cough, cough, the toilet, cough...    Eh? You were licking what, again?    I couldn't hear you very well.    Who cares what it was?    I need to disinfect my tongue.    Just give me the medicine already.    Hm? I thoughtI just heard the word "toilet"...    Actually, I already knew about that.    But I couldn't resistteasing him about this first!    Hey! Jotaro already told you, didn't he?    You shitty old man!    You were messing with me!    Forget the medicine!    All right, all right. I'm sorry.    Come here, and I'll fix you up, Polnareff.    If you don't take care of that,it'll get infected.    Ahem! Toilet. Ahem...    You licked it real good...    Jotaro, Kakyoin! Come on,let's get the hell out of here!    Everyone, come outside.    What on earth?    We step outside the hotel,and this place is...    It's a graveyard.    She used her Stand's fog    to make this graveyard look likethe town and hotel?    So we were talking to the corpsesthat were buried in these graves...    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    You wanna take her with us?Are you serious?    Yeah.    We need to know how many moreStand users are out there,    what their powers are,where in Egypt Dio is hiding...    And what Dio's Stand can do.    Yes, what kind of Stand is it?    If we can get the hag to tell us,    we might finally have the edge we need.    I doubt she'll be willing to sharethat information...    We just need to use Hermit Purple.    I'll project everythingshe's thinking onto a TV screen.    Great idea!    This place doesn't have any TVs,so we'll do it in the next town.    Hol Horse!    You bastard!    That's our car!    Sorry boys,I'm stickin' with Dio, after all.    Catch you later!    Provided you don't diebefore then, that is.    A little advice for y'all!    You better k*ll that old witch pronto!    Or else you'll find outjust how terrifying Dio really is!    See ya!    What the hell does that mean?    Why are you here in front of me?    Lord Dio will never...    They should be able to become smaller.    When I say I'm going to do something...    He just went flying like the other guy!    Oh, God!    You don't need power to k*ll humans...
02x16 - The Lovers, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:35With Enyaba in tow,and a new carriage to boot,  Jojo and crew arrivedin the coastal town of Karachi,  Pakistan's industrialand financial center,  located in the Indus River delta.   EPISODE   : THE LOVERS, PART ONE  Hey, a doner kebab joint!  Let's stop and get something to eat.  The doner kebab: it's been calledthe hamburger of the Middle East!  A slab of meat is placed on a spit,   its outer layer roasting as it turns.   Before long, the meat is cooked,sliced, and served on bread.   Try it, your taste buds will thank you!   'Scuse me, five doner kebabs, please.   That'll be a thousand yen.   A thousand yen?   In the Middle East,   Japanese and Western business practicesare by no means universal.   Namely, prices changeand are subject to negotiation.   First-time visitors naiveof the value of goods for sale   can become easy targets for exploitation.   But here, such exploitationis not frowned upon.   The swindled are deservingof the label "fool," not "victim."   Haggling takes guts and ingenuity!   A thousand yen?   The first step is the art of the bluff.   Make it clear you see through the trick.   Don't mock me, now! That's far too much.   A hearty laugh always helps. Then...   How much would you buy them for?   ...the merchant will test the waters.   Make it     yen for five!   In return, you throw out a price so low,   you can't help but blush.   And then...   Are you serious? You've got to be kidding!   He'll act as ifyou have no sense at all...   If I sold them for that cheap,my entire family would starve!   Then he'll gesture the old throat slash.   But you can't give up the fight just yet.   I guess I'll just buy them somewhere else.   Pretend that you're leaving...   Okay, friend! I very much like foreigners.   I'll sell you five for     yen.   ...he'll try to stop you.   Then make it    .   Let the haggling begin!   Six hundred!   Three hundred and fifty!   Five hundred and fifty!   -Four hundred!-Four hundred and fifty!   Four hundred and twenty five!   I'll take them!   All right! I got them for less thanhalf his original price!   Take that! I made out like a bandit!   And just as you think you won...   I usually sell five for     yen!   Bye-bye, thank you, sir!   Hey! The old lady's awake.   Eh?   I've told them nothing!   What are you doing here?   You think I, Enyaba,   would tell them the secretof Lord Dio's Stand?   Huh?   What the hell are these tentacles?   Why...   Why have you come to k*ll me?   Lord Dio places his trust in no one.   I will make sure you never speak again.   And you four...   will be next.   Grandma!   What?   You can call me Dan...   Dan of Steel.   My Stand represents The Lovers card.   I will see to it thatyou all meet the same fate   as that pathetic Enyaba.   How could you?   That old lady was one of your own!   Grandma!   Lies...   They're all lies...   Lord Dio would neverdo such a thing to me....   Those things wrigglingout of her aren't from a Stand!   They're real! Those tentacles are real!   Lord Dio would never do me such harm...   He'd never plant a flesh bud in me...   Flesh bud?   Lord Dio is my only reason for living...   We trust each other wholeheartedly...   Grandma!   See that?   The rays of the sun disintegrated them!   The flesh buds!They're made from Dio's cells!   Precisely!   I must say,you are quite the perceptive one.   That's what a flesh bud madeof Dio's cells looks like fully grown.   I just grew it inside the old hag.    Enyaba, you may have taughtLord Dio about Stands,    but you're a fool to thinkhe would ever trust    a feeble old woman like you.    Unfortunately,it's a point you failed to realize.    Old lady!    What's the true identity of Dio's Stand!    Tell us!    You trusted and admired Dio,    and now you know he's notthe man you think he is!    We must defeat Dio! You've got to tell us!    We need to know!    Tell us what we need to knowabout Dio's Stand!    Lord... Dio...    He believes in me.    I will never tell...    Oh, God!    So sad...    Such an unfortunate old woman.    But the very depth of her trust    shows just how powerfulLord Dio's evil charm is.    Enyaba may forever be entwinedwith my sister's death,    but she didn't deserve that.    I'll see you join her!    Four against one, but we won't hold back.    Prepare yourself.    On your feet.    Hey, jackass!    Stop acting so damned cool.    This is going down,whether you want it or not.    As you wish.    But none of you    will be able to lay a single fingeron me, Dan of Steel.    What?    What happened, Mr. Joestar?    He flew back just like that guy!    You fool!    I was about to explain my abilities.    You almost k*lled your owngrandfather with that blow.    Listen up.    Do you really think I would showmy face here    just to k*ll Enyaba?    You damn bastard...    You told us that your Standis the Lovers, isn't that right?    So, what the hell does it do?    The battle has already begun, Mr. Joestar.    You're all simpletons...    Look all you want,but you won't see my Stand.    Hey, half-pint!    Want some cash?    It's yours if you hit my legwith that broom.    But why would he...    Now hit me!    The hell? Mr. Joestar?    It hurts!    I don't get it! My leg hurts so bad!    Still haven't figured it out,Joseph Joestar?    My Stand enters bodies!    The moment Enyaba d*ed,    it clambered into your ear canaland entered your brain.    What?    My Stand and I are connected!    If my Stand gets hurt, then so do I.    And the opposite holds true!    If you so much as scratch me,    deep inside your brain,    my Stand will react to my painand discomfort,    and fly into a rage.    And it will amplify that painto the same bodily location.    Now I'll say it once more...    You won't be able to lay a single fingeron me!    Plus the Lovers    has taken one of Lord Dio'sflesh bud into your body.    It's growing in your brain as we speak.    Just like it did to Enyaba,it'll eat you from the inside out!    Ow!    I don't recall asking youto strike me again.    Stupid little brat!    Well, I must confess,    my Stand, The Lovers,lacks physical strength.    It can't move evena single strand of hair,    making it the world's weakest Stand.    But...    You needn't be strong to k*ll someone.    Understand, gentlemen?    THE LOVERSDAN OF STEEL    Say something unfortunate happens,    like I get into an accident,a baseball hits me,    or I simply trip and fall, Mr. Joestar...    You will feel my pain many times over.    I can feel your knuckles crackingin my artificial prosthetic hand!    You've got ten minutes.    Then your brain will be eaten through,    and you will die like Enyaba.    Jotaro, calm down! Don't do anything rash.    No. I'm gonna k*ll this tool so quickly,    he won't have time to feel pain!    k*ll me before I feel it, huh...    Sounds interesting.    Do it, then, Jotaro.    Let's see what happens.    What were you planning to destroy?    Tell me. My face? Throat?    What? You angry? Come on and try it!    Let's just see what happens!    How about busting a hole in my chest?    Or how about you give upon using your Stand,    and cr*ck my head open with a rock?    This one looks like a prime specimen.    Sure looks big enough for the job.    You do not want to underestimate me.    When I say I'm going to do something,I do it.    Jotaro, don't do it!    You already know what he can do!    Are you trying to k*llyour own grandfather?    He just might do it...    Dumb punk.    Oh...    You...    Jotaro!    Don't toy with me, you bastard.    After the geezer kicks the bucket,you're next!    Look out!    The Lovers will enteryour brain and k*ll you!    What the hell do you think you're doing?    This is just insane.    My grandson is getting beatenso I can survive...    We're completely at this guy's mercy.    His Stand is inside my head...    I remember how that poison ringwas implanted around my aorta long ago...    Come on, think, Joseph!    There's gotta be something you can do!    Hey!    Jotaro! Keep him away from Mr. Joestar!    We're going to get as far awayfrom him as possible!    Oh, I see...    You think putting distancebetween me and the old man    might make my Stand's power disappear?    But my Stand's weaknessis made up for in other ways.    The Lovers may be physically weak,but from within its host,    its range is fartherthan any Stand in existence.    Even if it's hundreds of kilometers away.    Hey, Jotaro! I'm talking to you!    It's impolite not to look at peoplewhen they're speaking to you.    Look at me!    You sound likeyou're starting to lose your cool.    What's your plan?    Follow me arounduntil Grandpa Joseph keels over?    Dan, was it?    You know, I'm gonna make you pay for this.    Well, if you're going to follow me around,    I might as well borrow a few more things.    Nothing but chump change, huh?    Though I didn't expect a guy like you    to be sporting a TAG Heuer...    I'll be borrowing this.    There!    An electronics store!Mr. Joestar, they have TVs!    Yeah, so? Why does that matter now?    Come on, Polnareff, did you thinkwe were just running away?    I'm going to fight this blasted Standthat's inside my head.    Fight?    We have only a few minutes.    And we're gonna need your help.    Huh?    Hermit Purple!    -It's there!-Oh, no!    I can't believe I'm lookingat the inside of my brain!    I get that there's a really small Stand    inside Mr. Joestar...    But how the hellare we going to destroy it?    By having our Standstravel inside Mr. Joestar    to locate and destroy it.    What?    Stands are simplymaterializations of energy.    We should be able to shrink them.    Kakyoin!    Hey, be gentle with me!    There's no time.We're going in now, Polnareff!    All right!    Hierophant Green!    Silver Chariot!    Smaller!    Get smaller.    We're going to be entering a blood vessel.    Right...    A ditch...    I'd try to jump it,    but I could trip and twist my ankleby accident.    And walking all the wayto that bridge would be such a pain.    Hey, Jotaro.    Lie down and make yourself into a bridge.    I'll just walk on you to get across.    What? You don't want to be my bridge?    The hell do you keep yammering about?    I said, make yourself into a bridge!    You good-for-nothing arrogant prick!    -What's the matter?-Mr. Joestar!    My leg...    It's going numb...    Dammit, Jotaro,what the hell are you doing?    Aww, don't look so upset, Jotaro?    Come on, I don't have all day.    Good.    You're a rather sturdy bridge, aren't you?    Aren't you?    Aren't you?    Aren't you...    Mr. Joestar,    it seems the enemy is here,hiding around the thalamus,    the point where the nervous system begins.    Polnareff and I will enter a blood vessel    from inside your inner ear,    then swim through the blood vesselstoward the brain stem.    Polnareff, open a slit in the wallof his blood vessel.    Hey, hold on! You're using your Stands!    Can't they just go through it instead?    Not at this size.    The blood vessel's wall is too thick.    The hole will be microscopic in size,    so bleeding won't be an issue.    At our size,    severing a blood vessel or nervewould take several minutes.    Otherwise, the Lovers would'vedone it already.    Though, it may have already started...    Keeping our Stands this smallis really exhausting.    You need a lot of Stand power.    Here we go!    Oh, my God!    I don't feel so well...    My back itches...    I'm in a really good mood right now.    How about I have you lick it for me?    The one who knows himself best will win!    Everything begins when youacknowledge your own weakness!
02x17 - The Lovers, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:36EPISODE   :THE LOVERS, PART    What a nice bridgeyou make, Jotaro.  Hey, Jotaro. My back itches.  Scratch it!  Just a little lower.  Lower.  Oh yeah, that's it.  But not too hard, mind you.  -Mister Joestar?-Hey, what's the matter?   It feels likesomeone's tickling my back.   I can't concentratemuch longer like this!   Mister Joestar!   Looks like we've gotquite the c*ptive audience.   Mister Joestar, keep your voice down!   People are staring!   They'll think you're crazy!   You think I'm screamingfor the hell of it?   -Oh, no!-That poor man...   Let's give him some change.   Why are they throwing money?   Older relatives like thatcan be tough.   That is so true.   Kakyoin, go buy the TV.   Let's get out of this crowd.   Right.   Is this your store?   Uh... Yes it is...   I'd like to buy that TV.   Unbelievable...   Kakyoin's Hierophantand Polnareff's Chariot   shrunk themselvesto a microscopic level   and infiltrated Joestar's body.   They intend to fight me?   I can see them!   They're traveling throughthe bloodstream   and heading towardthe brain stem to my Lovers.   Quickly!   We don't have longbefore the flesh bud   in Mr. Joestar's braineats clean through!   Hurry, you two!   There!   All right!   Do it, Mister Joestar!   Hermit Purple!   These are...   the flesh bud's tentacles!   We finally made itto the brain stem,   but the flesh bud'salready taken over!   Damn it!   It's him!   Look!   He's using those weird clawsto knead Mr. Joestar's brain cells   into a gooey mash so he canfeed them to the flesh bud!   We have to destroy him and tear outthe flesh bud's roots quickly,   or they'll completelydevour his brain!   Okay!   I'll julienne him to ribbons!   You know on second thought.   A finer cut should do the trick!   Like grating a radish!   No you don't!   Now!   He did it!   No, not quite!   Gotta say, Kakyoin,that thing's pretty fast.   But I've already figured him out.   If that's all the little beast has,then he's no match for--   Polnareff!   Who are you talking to?   Huh?   Polnareff, that's not me.   And that's not a Stand you slashed!   It's melting away!   What?   I'm The Lovers!   Polnareff!   He disguised himself!   He was wearing Mr. Joestar's brain!   Somehow that thing usedthe kneaded brain cells   to disguise himselfas my Hierophant Green!   All you destroyed was a decoymade of those brain cells!   And you dummiescompletely fell for it!   Come on!   Pull your head out of your ass!   Better shine these shoes right,Jotaro!   I'm in a fantastic mood, you know!   So until these shoes shineas bright as I feel,   and I can see that bright sunon them, clear as day,   I'm gonna need you to polishyour little heart out.   If you'd like, you're welcometo use your uniform.   Actually, why don't youuse your tongue?   Hey! You bastard!   What are you writing?   You're looking at your tab.   And you're gonna pay in full.   I wrote it down, so I won't forget.   You're a scoundrel, Jotaro.   Well, it doesn't matter.   It'll all be meaninglessin the end.    Kakyoin, look!    Check out the decoy's headI just opened!    What the hell's going on?    He's splitting into two!    Listen up.    To win in life,one must thoroughly know oneself!    It's like Aesop's fable    when the unassuming tortoisebeats the hare.    The tortoise outruns the hare    because he knows his abilitiesbetter than anyone!    Of course,the same applies to me.    I know perfectly wellI lack the power and speed    to mortally wound either of you.    But remember this!    The spoils belong to thosewho admit their own weaknesses!    Emerald Splash!    Did it work?    More decoys are formingfrom the brain cells.    They're multiplying!    But a person can haveonly one Stand,    which means only one is real!    Where's the real one?    Right here!    Emerald Splash!    Close but no cigar!I was standing right next to--    The more decoys we hit,the more they multiply!    No, no...    It's me...    They're all me!    Polnareff, that's enough!    Withdraw your Stand now.    I can't just watch you get hurt,even if you are trying to save me.    No way in hell!    I can't standthe thought of giving up    and watching you die like this.    Withdraw your Stand!You'll be k*lled!    Do as I say.    It's over.    We fight to the end, Mister Joestar!    I can't tell...    They're all the same!    Which is the real one?    Which is the Stand?    I can't tell them apart!    The world's weakest Stand is...    The most...    the most powerful of all!    Hey now, Jotaro, look!    A beautiful gold bracelet.    Pretty impressive, eh?    It'd make any girlfall head over heels.    Jotaro,    see that space there in the glass?    Use your Standto sneak through and steal it!    Steal it.What don't you understand?    Get a move on!    I mean...    I don't mind breaking the glassand taking the bracelet myself.    Then again, if I'm caught,I could be beaten to a bloody pulp.    Old Joseph would surelydie from the pain.    Hurry it up!    While the salesman'slooking the other way!    This guy's shoplifting!    Son of a--     THE LOVERSDAN OF STEEL    Mister Salesman!    Please, sir!Don't let him get away!    Sure thing!    You bastard...    All right? Where's the thief?    Who's the culprit?    That guy, there?    That Asian kid?    Ya know, back where I come from,    when someone steals somethingwe chop off their fingers!    Hey, Jotaro.    You better not use your Standagainst civilians.    Punk!    Take this!    Despicable!    Dirty thief!    Now get the hellout of our country!    Good-for-nothing assh*le!    We'll let you off easy.You can keep your fingers for now!    That was great!Nicely done, my friend!    Thanks to the commotionyou caused,    I was able to get my handson an even better piece!    Jotaro!    What the hell are you laughing at?    What's so damn funny?    Nothing.I'm just a bit excited.    I was laughing 'causeyour punishment just doubled.    And I've been waitingfor this moment!    It's almost payback time,and it's really got me tingling.    Why, you!    It would seem we have somethingof a misunderstanding.    Sorry, but your Old Manisn't long for this world.    That's the reality you're facing.    How sad.    You don't know usvery well, do you?    I see you don't knowKakyoin at all.    Come again?    It seems to me you're obsessedwith the notion of knowing oneself.    It makes sense.    I suppose I'm inclined to agree.    To know oneselfis an important lesson.    But so is "know thy enemy."    You should have done your homework.    Can't you see?    My Hierophant...    has the powerto stretch out its feelers!    I've been inspectingevery one of you!    How could I've not noticedsomething touching me!    So you're the Stand!    Emerald Splash!    Success!    Well, well...    Looks like Kakyoingot you pretty damn good.    I'm wondering...    Will I get my paybackonce he's done?    He's realizedhe's out of his league!    He's trying to escapeinto the artery!    He's trying to escape!    He's trying to escapefrom Mr. Joestar's brain!    Huh? Did you say he's leaving?    All right!That's great news, isn't it?    -Mister Joestar, hurry! The flesh bud!-Right!    Overdrive!    The flesh bud's vanishing!    Thank God.    This whole experience sure has donea lot to bring us together.    You're incorrigible, Polnareff.    Hold on a minute.    If that thing's really tryingto leave my brain.    It'll go backto its Stand user, Dan of Steel...    The bastard is returning to its user!    This is bad!    Jotaro has no way of knowing!    What's wrong?Why are you backing away from me?    Aren't you going to tell memore about my grandfather's death?    Hey...    What's with the big hurry?    Got somewhere to go?    You're not actually tryingto run away, are you?    After all you've done...    Please, Jotaro, sir, forgive me!    I admit it, you win!    I'll change! I'll lie on the groundand lick your boots!    I know what I did was wrong!    You can pummel meas much as you'd like!    Hit me! Kick me!    But please, don't k*ll me!    Soon,    very soon,the Lovers will return to me!    And this idiot, Jotaro,doesn't have a clue!    This time it'll infiltrateyour brain!    Kakyoin is hundreds of meters away.Just you wait!    I'll make you sufferpain so horrible    you'll wish you were never born!    It's here!    Now! Enter his ear!    I figured you'd trysomething shitty like this.    Don't you know my Stand,Star Platinum,    has superior eyesight and reflexes?    Didn't you check up on us at all?    I wasn't planning anything!    Not againstyour Stand's immense power.    Did you just say "Your" Stand?    Just "your"?    No! I meant your awesomeand powerful Stand    is far superior to any other!    I knew I didn't stand a chance,so I had it come back!    Please look!    You've already shatteredmy arm and leg to pieces!    I can't possibly fight anymore!I can't even move!    Yeah...    All the crap you did to me,    I guess an arm and legshould make up for it.    Do you swear you'll never showyour face to us again?    I swear!    I'll head for some deserted island!    I'll go to the ends of the earthand never return to bother you!    You'd better not be lying.    The next time I see that face,it'll get a thousand punches.    I'm not lying!I'd never ever lie to you!    Get lost.    Let's play soccer over there!    But then I can't play!    Jotaro!    You're an utter fool!    Just take a look at that girl!    My Stand, The Lovers,just went into that girl's ear.    Now he's heading for her brain.    You'd better not move, Jotaro!    I'm going to s*ab youin the back with this Kn*fe,    and make sureyou never move again!    att*ck me with your Star Platinum,    and this girl's pathetic lifeends right here and now!    You'd never allow    such an innocent child to die,would you?    Oh, good grief.Go ahead and s*ab me, then.    Hey! Didn't you hear me?I said don't move!    Don't...    What? Huh?    What's the matter?    Didn't you say somethingabout stabbing me?    Like this, right?    My body won't move! Why?    What's this thingwrapped around me?    I see you didn't notice.    Kakyoin tied Hierophant's tentacles    around the legof your fleeing Stand.    They stretch all the way backto him like a kite string.    Guess you weretoo self-absorbed to realize it.    Please forgive me!    Ask for forgiveness from Enyaba,the woman you k*lled.    I never had the slightest intentionof forgiving you.    Dio paid me to do this.You can have it all.    Good grief.    You really are a piece of work.    What you owe me,can never be paid back with money!    Your receipt.Keep the freakin' change.     JOTARO KUJO    I have this feelinglike someone is staring at us,    so I keep looking back.    Are you sureyou're not just being paranoid?    I can't help but feelthat presence, too.    I really can't shake the feelingthat someone's staring at us.    Something's strange.
02x18 - The SunQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:37How could this have happened?  I can't believe...  I can't believewe totally fell for it.  Having managed to haltThe Lovers' invasive att*ck,  Jotaro and company avoid  the political unrestin Iran and Iraq,  and instead crossthe Arabian Sea at Karachi  to arrive atthe United Arab Emirates.   Now then, if you'd be so kindas to sign this document,   everything will besquared away, sir.   Right here, yes?   You know, if a pretty girl like youasked me to,   I might even be inclinedto buy a car.   My, aren't you sweet.   How'd you feel about the two of usgetting dinner sometime?   Polnareff, I hate to interruptwhen you're obviously so busy, but...   Mister Joestar!   Come on, it's time to leave.   Seriously!Try not to mess with the hair!   Do you know how hard it isto look this good?   As if anybody caresabout your hairdo.   You're driving.   Righto.   Bye, Mademoiselle.   But Mister Joestar,I don't get why we're riding in   such a fancy, expensive carin this sandy death trap.   Wouldn't an off-road vehiclebe better?   You'll find out soon enough.   Wow, this country's amazing!   It's like every house issome kind of crazy mansion.   Indeed.   In Tokyo, you'd needthree to four billion yen   to buy one of these.   This is the standard of livingin this country.   It wasn't but twenty years agothat this place was a barren desert.   Though, thanks toa thriving oil industry,   it's grown intoa playground for the rich.   That sun may be merciless,   but it sure is nice and coolin here with the air-conditioning.   Not too shabby.   Oh?   What's wrong, Kakyoin?   It's nothing.   I was just thinking abouthow open the landscape is here.   If anyone were after us,I'm sure we'd spot them.   But I just can't shake the feelingthat someone's watching us.   Yeah, can't say that I blame you.   Well, back to business.   I've given a bit of thoughtto the route we should take.   About a hundredkilometers northwest   is a village called Yarpline.   The desert and mountains   make taking a direct routenear impossible.   It takes two days to reach by car,   so the locals usea Cessna to get there.   We should go to the villageand buy a Cessna,   then we can crossthe vast Saudi Arabian desert.   You know,I've been apprehensive about   getting anywhere near a plane.   If a Stand user att*cked,and the plane went down,   we'd be puttinginnocent lives at risk.   With a Cessna,I could be the pilot.   We'd be able to savesome time for sure.   Flying in a Cessna with a manwho's been in three plane crashes.   Yeah, that sound's likea perfect idea to me.   That comment notwithstanding...   Our priority should becrossing the desert   and hightailing itto the village of Yarpline.   It'll take one day on camel-back.   Camel-back?   A Cessna's one thing,but on camel-back?   I've never riddena camel in my life!   Leave it to me.   I know these creatures well.I'll show you the ropes.   You boys sit backand watch the magic happen.   You want camels, you say?   Sure, but they're gonnacost you my friend.   And they need a gentle touch.   We're kind ofin a life-or-death situation here,   so we need them,whatever it takes.   As for payment,how about a trade for that car?   What?   I couldn't possibly acceptsuch an offer, sir.   Yeah, Mister Joestar!   Besides, you literallyjust bought that car!   What other reasondo you think I had   to buy such a fancy, expensive car?   It's true an off-road vehiclewould perform better here.   But we can't justwrite a check here.   And cash isn't normally accepted.   No, here,trading is far more effective.   If you try to buy safety for cheapin a time of emergency,   you'll find yourselfeven worse off in the end.   Well, it just meanswe've suffered a lot already.   -Hey, Mister.-Huh?   I take it we have a deal?   Oh, you know what?   To even things out a bit,   how bout you give me the waterin those tanks there, too.    It's the most important thingwhen you're in the desert.    But the water isn't nearlyas valuable as your car, sir.    You are very strange indeed, sir.    All right, everyone.Let's get ready.    Crossing the desertwill be no easy task.    Brace yourselves men!    That stinks!    Hey, Mister Joestar.    How the heckdo you ride these things?    It's, like, three meters tall.    So with camels...    You make them sit first,and then get on.    You make them sit first,and then get on.    You make them sit, then get on!    Give me a minute.He'll sit, just you wait.    Hey! Sit down would you!    Damn it, this one's stubborn!    You have riddenone of these before, right?    I will have you know I've watched    Lawrence of Arabia three times,start to finish!    I know all too wellhow to ride a camel!    Though, two of those times,I slept through half of it...    You learned to ride from a movie?    What?    You've never actually ridden one?    The saliva makes great sunscreen!The more you know!    Listen up.    When you're handling an animal,    it's imperative to understandexactly how it feels.    And I mean exactly!    Here, doesn't this yummy applelook scrumptious?    It's really good!    Come on, come on.    There's a good boy.    You see?I made the camel sit down!    If you take the time to get insideits head, it'll sit down for you!    I did it!    It's so high off the ground!    And did you know camels can closetheir nostrils to keep sand out?    And before I forget.    You're forbidden from makingdumb camel jokes!    All right.    Now for the finer pointsof riding a camel.    Listen up.    Camels don't walkanything like horses.    The front and back legon either side move forward together,    so these things can sway a lot.    Find a way to ridewith the camel's rhythm,    and you'll be just fine.    For example!    Hey, wait! You're going too fast!    Listen to me, dammit!    I didn't tell you to go that way!    Okay, then!    Now that everyone's gottenthe hang of mounting and riding.    We have a desert to get through!    Onward toward the northwest!    Hey!    Something's wrong.    I still have the feelingsomeone's watching us.    Kakyoin, don't you think you mightbe worrying a bit too much?    The palm leavesare erasing our tracks.    Plus we can see for kilometersin all directions.    If someone were here, we'd know.    No, I've been sensingsomeone's presence, too.    Better take a look around,then, Jotaro.    See anything suspicious out there?    No, nothing.    Nothing whatsoever. But...    Something's not right here.Something's just...    Hey, let's hurry up and go.    Yeah.    Let's get as far away as we can.    We'll traveltill the sun goes down,    then stop to pitch our tents.    It's much too dangerousfor us to travel at night.    Yeah, but it's sweltering out here!    Look, it's fifty degrees Celsius!    Yeah, it is hot out here.    Then again, right around this timeis when it's hottest.    Eight o'clock? Wha--    Jotaro! Check your watch.What time does it say?    It's ten past eight...    Hey, Old Man!    So, it is...    I know we lost track of time, but...    what the hell's going on?    It's past eight o'clock at night!    So why isn't the sun setting?    Impossible!    The thermometer's jumpingto sixty degrees Celsius!    It's not setting...    It's actually rising in the west!    Could the sun really be...    ...a Stand?     THE SUNARABIA FATS    My God!    We're in the middle of the desert!    Take cover behind those rocks!    That sun is a Stand?    We're such fools!How did we miss this?    I knew we were being watched,    but never thought this is whywe can't see our stalker!    At this rate,that sun's gonna burn all day...    no, all night long...    That Stand's gonna roast uslike a couple of rotisserie chickens!    We're screwed!    I doubt it'll take that long.    A sauna can dangerously raisethe body's temperature in minutes.    Then how do we fight it?    Damn it!It's seventy degrees Celsius now!    You can't even tellif that Stand is close or far away!    The distance is impossible to judge!    The fastest way    is to take care of the Stand user.    Indeed, the user,he has to be nearby.    We have to find him.    He must have a wayof concealing himself    to follow us this whole time.    Wait a minute!    What if he's like The Lovers?    What if he can use his Standfrom far away?    That's impossible.    A weak Stand canbe controlled from a distance,    but this sun is just too strong.    The energy it's emitting is incredible.    The Stand user has to be nearby.    This is bad.    The camels are starting to collapsefrom the heat.    This waiting isn'tgetting us anywhere!    I'll have Hierophantsurvey the area.    Kakyoin!    I'm only searching forthe Stand's location.    Once we know how far away it is,    we might be ableto locate the user.    Twenty meters. Forty meters...    Sixty meters. Eighty meters...    One hundred...    Something's not right!    Kakyoin!Have Hierophant come back!    Something's coming right for us!    Before that happens, Emerald...    Kakyoin!    The camel!    You bastard!    I'm gonna bust a holein the ground!    Everyone get in!    You okay, Kakyoin?    Yes. I was in the middleof initiating my Emerald Splash,    so that protected mefrom any major damage.    More concerningis this intense heat.    I feel like it's goingto drive me insane.    That att*ck was so accurate.    The Stand user must bewatching us from somewhere!    But from where? Where is he?    Keep your voice down.    The enemy will find us!    Just lay low. We'll sit tightfor a while and see what happens.    Oh, sh*t!    Things can't go on like this.    Come on, think!    It's time for this old-timerto grab the bull by the horns!    But this is a far-from-ideal spot.    I can't even use my best technique.    I have to get more information.    Jotaro!    Son of a bitch!    Where the hell are you?    How are you watching us?    Are you invisible or something?    Hey, Kakyoin, what's the matter?    Hey, Kakyoin!    The hell are you laughing about?    Are you all right, Kakyoin?    Control yourself, man!    Jotaro?    You too?    Polnareff!    Not you too?    Oh my God!    They've finally gone madfrom the heat!    Am I the only one who's still sane?    Hey! Jotaro,get a hold of yourself!    You have to settle down!    Sometimes things get rough,    and when they do,you have to stay cool!    What?    Don't get the wrong idea,Mister Joestar.    Have a look atthat rock over there.    It's large enough for someoneto hide behind, is it not?    I'm not following.    Now take a look at the rockon the opposite side.    Opposite side?    Still don't see it?    There's a rock that's shapedexactly the same    on the opposite side.    The shadow is also reversed.Which means...    What a stupid trick!    Move.    Stay here, Old Man.    Jotaro! If you go out there now,    you're all but askingthe enemy to att*ck you!    It's dangerous!    It made a hole in the sky?    Good grief.    You really are pathetic, Old Man.    I'll just assumethe heat was too much for you.    Or else I'd find it hard to believeyou're my grandfather.    Since we defeated the enemy Stand,night's finally fallen.    Or maybe I should say,it's back to being night.    However you wanna slice it,we're safe!    Just how long do you planon hiding in that hole?    Right.    Good grief.    It's finally gotten dark.    Well, whaddya know, it's a mirror!    Take a look.    Check out the little car he hasbehind the mirror.    It looks rather comfy.It even has air conditioning.    Man, I had no ideahe was reflecting the desert    and tailing us from behindin this nifty little thing.    I see he has a t*nk of water, too.    How bout we take it off his hands?    Oh, and here's a drink.    Huh? You mean we've alreadybeaten the Stand user?    There's nothing else to do?    We don't even knowthis guy's name,    but somehow we've alreadymade short work of his Stand?    Yes, you've hit the nailon the head.     THE SUNRETIRED    So this wasthe Sun card's Stand, huh?    At first he was pretty impressive,    but once we figured him out,he actually kinda sucked.    Well, onto our next destination.    It's pretty chilly in the desertat night, isn't it?    Hold your horses!Traveling at night is dangerous!    Why don't we camp out herefor the night!    Well that idiot's finished,so it'll be sweet dreams tonight!    Ba-dum-tss.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW
02x19 - Death 13, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:37That piercing noise...  What is this place?  An amusement park?  I've never been here before.  Why in the world am I riding ona Ferris wheel in my pajamas?  Something's wrong.  The desert...  I remember being in the desert  riding through Saudi Arabiaon camel back.   But where are the others?   Did they abandon me?   This isn't making any sense.   There's not a soul anywherein this amusement park,   so why do I hearthe cries of a baby?   Where is it?    This card is...    Death   !   The card's moving!   Kakyoin!   Hey, take it easy!   Stop screaming and shaking the bedlike that girl from The Exorcist.   You're weirding me out.   -Where are we?-Don't ask stupid questions.   Come on, get up already.   After breakfast,we're gonna take to the skies.   Looks like another scorcher.   I had a terrible nightmare.   It was horrifying.   Oh, lay on the details.   I wanna hear all about it!   Thing is, I can't remember.   -I've forgotten it all.-Huh?   Regardless, it was petrifying.   You woke me up,and pulled me out of it.   Wish we could talk more,but we gotta get a move on!   Let's go.   Hurry up and get ready!   There's a cut on my hand.   How'd it get there?    EPISODE   :DEATH   , PART      Jotaro and Mr. Joestar arealready headed to the plane.   Supposedly, we're travelingfive hundred kilometers today.   My dog!   My poor dog is...   dead!   Who would do such a thing?   A dog?   A dog...   I could've sworn I sawa dead dog not too long ago.   Whoever did this is sick,   but there's nothingwe can do about it.   Let's go.   Hey!   Hold on a dang second, Mister.   What exactly do you mean,you "can't sell us the plane now"?   You had no problemtaking my money last night!   You'll get a full refund.   But first we need to seeto a baby with a fever.   -It's    degrees Celsius.-Huh?   We have no doctor here.   We have no choice butto take the baby somewhere else.   Then how aboutthe plane over there?   That one's broken.   What's up? Some kind of argument?   Yeah.   A baby...   I remember hearing a baby's cries.   But where?   The plane will be backtomorrow night.   I can sell it to you after that.   Tomorrow night?   We've got someone's lifeon the line too!   We can't spend two dayspissing around this place!   So you'd rather let that baby die?   Well, I...   Excuse me, I have a suggestion.   We can give the babyto these gentlemen.   They can take itto the doctor on their way.   Uh, nice idea, but...   The Cessna is built to carry four.   But surely there's roomenough for a baby.   I could've swornI just saw it smile.   The baby already has teeth?   You sure about this, lady?   Do you really wannaleave it with them?   Just a minute!We can't do that either!   It's too dangerous for the babyto come with us.   I told themthis would be dangerous.   Hey, just tryand take it easy, Mister Joestar.   No Stand can catch a plane flyinghundreds of kilometers an hour.   We even made surethe plane isn't a Stand.   I'm more worried aboutthe Old Man's flying   than an att*ck from an enemy Stand.   Oh, thank goodness!   What a relief.   But I wonder whose baby was that?   You're not the motherof that child?   Oh no, I found it by the wellthis morning.   From the moment I heardthe baby's crying,    I couldn't help myself.    I felt I had to put himon that plane.    What?    I always get so tiredwhen I get on a plane.    Mister Joestar, sorry, but I thinkI need a thirty-minute cat nap.    Sure.    What is this?    Hey Kakyoin,where the hell are we?    Where's Mr. Joestar and Jotaro?    This is the same dreamI had this morning.    We're inside a dream!    -What? A dream?-Yes.    That's a relief!Just a stupid dream.    You had me worried there.    If it's only a dream,who cares about a dead dog?    Polnareff, you can't be serious!    Dreams are only as scaryas you make them.    -Oh, just try and relax.-No!    How can I when we're havingthe same dream?    I suppose you do have a point.    It is kinda weird.    But in a dreamisn't anything possible?    Oh, boy! Wouldja look at that!    Lucky me!This dreaming thing is great!    See? Think your dream is fun,and it will be!    Listen!    You saw the dog's carcassthis morning!    It must have been dreamingthe same dream as me!    It was k*lled in this dream!    I got this cut on my handwhile in the dream too.    By whom?    By the enemy's Stand, Death   !    The enemy's Stand?    Yes.    I get it, you had a dreamabout Stands!    -Come on, you've got to take it easy.-No!    It wasn't a dream about Stands!    A Stand was in my dream!    That's what I said.    You were having a dreamabout Stands.    You still don't get it, do you?    Lali-ho! Tell me, does it hurtbeing that stupid?    Oh, for the love of...    I'm saying you're slowon the uptake, Polnareff!    It's coming from the dog's wound.    Lali-ho!    This is a dream,and I'm the grim reaper,    -Polnareff!-A megaphone?    What is that thing?    Polnareff, stay on guard!    That fiend is Death   !    Wor--    Come forth, Hierophant Green!    Hierophant, att*ck!    Chario--    Why can't I summon Hierophant?    I can't get Chariotto come out either!    Is it because we're insome kind of twisted dream?    Lali-ho!    It's romantic, wouldn't you agree?Being able to die in a dream!    Lali-ho!    DEATH       Jotaro, do you sense that?    Yeah, clear as day.    Are you stupid?    Surely you know only a Standcan defeat a Stand!    It's time for you to enteryour eternal sleep, Polnareff.    Lali-ho...    Polnareff!    Die!    Polnareff.    Hey, Polnareff, wake up.    Polnareff, seems our littletraveler wet himself.    Hurry up and change his diaper.    Curses! Someone must havewoken the fool.    He's quite lucky.    Lali-ho.I suppose it's no matter.    Even if he wakes up,he won't remember a single thing.    I'll just have to finish himthe next time he falls asleep.    So, Kakyoin,it looks like you get to be first!    Lali-ho!    Hey, Polnareff, you awake yet?    The diaper!    All right, I'm up...    I feel like I had some kindof terrifying nightmare.    But I don't rememberwhat happened at all.    I've completely forgotten...    Once you change the boy's diaper,you can head back to dreamland.    I won't wake you again.    Hold on a second guys!    The kid took a dump in his diaper!    Look!Just look at the size of it!    Well, he is a baby.That's why he wears diapers.    You're kidding me!That's why?    I had no idea!What a vile, disgusting creature!    And he's gotten itall over the place!    Stop yapping and changethe diaper already!    It stinks.    How are you not embarrassed?    Grow up already, will you?    Does this look right to you?    Well, it looks good to me.    Jotaro, hold on to the edge there.    I'm going to try and pin it.    Okay. Like this?    Now hold on to the baby.    Lali-ho!    -Stop it!-Kakyoin, what's wrong?    Hey! What's going on?    Stop it!    Damn it!    I've lost control!    Hey!Don't tell me we're gonna crash?    Stop!    Kakyoin,what's the matter with you?    He was like this this morning!    I don't care, just calm him down!    Old man!Fix the control column!    We're gonna crash!    Kakyoin,pull yourself together, pronto.    We're about to crashbecause of you.    Lali-ho.    Talk about a restless sleeper!    At this rate, you're goingto k*ll yourself and my user.    Your user is that baby?    I don't believe it...    He's only about six months old.    I'm eleven months.Almost a year old!    You should also knowI'm a genius!    I may poop in my diapers,    but I know a helluva lot morethan you idiots!    Lali-ho!    And with that,you've lost your ability to scream!    A Stand within a dream...    I have to find a way to letMr. Joestar and Jotaro know.    What are you doing?    Dammit! Level us out!    Calm down!    "Panic" isn't part of my vocabulary.    Can't you see I'm working on it!    I'm not waking up...    Lali-ho.    No one's going to noticeif you're cutting your arm    with a Kn*fe that's smallerthan my wee-wee.    Besides, you can hurt yourselfall you want in a dream,    but you won't wake up.    As long as you're asleep,    I control every iotaof your precious mind.    Death    infiltrates the mindsof its slumbering victims    when they are attheir most vulnerable.    Damn it. Stop!    What's wrong, old man?    We're crashing!    I'll control it with Hermit Purple!    I did it!    I lifted the planejust in the nick of time!    What a close one...    It would seem we managedto avoid crashing.    That was too close for comfort.    Now then...    What do you say to me k*lling youby crushing that heart of yours?    Then Joestar and the otherswill think you had a heart att*ck.    Die! Kakyoin!    Did you guys see that?    How do you like them apples?    -My flying's not too shabby!-Hey.    What the hell is a palm treedoing all the way out here?    Good grief...    I knew it.    This had to happen!    CAIROABU DHABI    CRASH SITE    This good for now?    Yeah, thanks.    We survived, but...    Kakyoin, what's going on?    You got us into this whole mess,you know.    I'm not sure...    I feel like I just endureda horrible dream.    And when I awoke,I was utterly exhausted.    Something might bewrong with me.    Try and cheer up.It's probably just fatigue.    It's been about a month nowsince we left Japan,    and the enemies haven't let up.    Hey. Looks likethe baby's fever's gone down.    Thank goodnesshe's safe and sound!    If anything were to happen to him,I'd never forgive myself.    Peek-a-boo!    Such an adorable smile!    I don't get what's so funny.You're not even making any jokes.    What an idiot.    Put a sock in it!    This isn't my idea ofa perfect night either!    Hey, Old Man. The radio survived.    What should we do?Should we send out an SOS?    That'll mean Dio can find us, but...    We've got to.Let's call for rescue.    For the baby's sake.    I thought I was feelingtwinges of pain.    I'm bleeding...    Did I cut it when we crashed?    What's this? The cuts form letters.    Baby... Stand?    But how did they...?    What could this mean?It's my handwriting.    I can't remember anything.    Did I do this to myself?    The Kn*fe is free of blood,    and yet the bladeappears to be the culprit.    Could I've really forgottenviolently cutting my own arm?    Damn it!I was told he was clever.    I never thoughthe'd carve letters into his arm    while trying to wake himself.    What was that lookon the baby's face?    He deliberately looked away,the moment my gaze met his!    Baby...    Stand?    Baby... Stand.    Am I really losing my mind?    I'm starting to think...    this baby is a Stand user!    Hey, Kakyoin!    What do you think you're doing?    Come on, that is way too rough.    You could strangle the boy!What's wrong with you?    My apologies...    There, there,everything's all right.    Let's have something to eat.    A little food'llcalm you right down.    Hey, Jotaro.    It looks like Kakyoin'sreally starting to lose it.    There, there, everything's okay.    Will he make it throughthe rest of the trip?    -What do you think about Kakyoin?-Did you see that?    Kakyoin, that's enough. Stop that.    How foolish are you?    He's a Stand user!    Did you cut thatinto your arm yourself?    Am I making things even worse?    Lali-ho!

It's been about four weekssince we began our journey.  If we don't hurry,we'll be in serious trouble.  Kakyoin...  Hey, Jotaro.  What do you think is upwith Kakyoin?  First he nearly kills usin his sleep on the plane, now this.   He even went after the baby.   Something's just not right.   If you ask me,he's at his wit's end.   Do you think he'll be ableto keep going from here?   For a second there,I thought he actually figured me out.   But now Kakyoin'shalf-doubting himself.   To top things off,we're in the middle of the desert.   All I have to do is waituntil they fall asleep.   If there's no one to wake them up...   Something smells good.What kind of food is that?   Baby food.   It's a concoction of milk,egg yolks, bananas,   and bread all stewed together.   So, you wanna taste?   Wow!   This is flat-out amazing!Give me more!   Easy now!There won't be any left for the baby!   Incompetent bastard!   How dare you eat my food?   I'm wasting away over here!   Hurry up and feed me, dammit!   A...   A scorpion!   Blast it!   That was a close one.   Crap baskets!   Kakyoin was watching.   He k*lled the scorpion.   That baby really is...   sh*t!   That's it!   Mister Joestar, Polnareff,did you see that?   -Huh?-That baby's not normal!   He just k*lled a scorpion!   He stabbed it!   The boy skewered itwith his own safety pin!   Kakyoin, hold on.   The hell are you talking about?   I'm saying that baby's not a baby!   He's not even a year old,yet he knew what a scorpion is.   And he k*lled itwith those tiny hands of his!   A scorpion?   Where is it?   It's in here!   There should bean impaled scorpion in here!   It's gone?   I swear it's true!He hid it somewhere!   Check his clothes!   We got it, Kakyoin!Knock it off! That's enough!   Mister Joestar!   Like I said,you're clearly exhausted.   Get some rest,and we'll talk about it in the morning.   Okay, open wide! It's delicious!   Uh oh?What's the matter?   You were hungry a minute ago.Did you lose that big appetite?   Say "ah."   Stop it!   I can't eat right now, you idiot!   Mister Joestar!I'm not imagining things!   I don't know wherehe hid the scorpion,   but I'm sure he's the Stand user!   And there's something I havethat will prove it to you!   Look at these cuts!Read what it says!   It's a warning!   It must've happened to mewhen I was sleeping!   Oh, my God!   Kakyoin, you didn't do thatto yourself, did you?   Eh?   Kakyoin, it's finally happened...   Oh, my God!   You colossal buffoon!   Didn't you realize if you showed themthe cuts on your arm,   they'd think you were crazy?   Did I just make things worse?   It looks likeI have no other choice!   It's time for a little force!   Hierophant Green!   It's no use.   The guy has completely lost his mind.   This can't be happening.I'm certain of what I saw, Jotaro...   His Stand was the one we foughtin our dreams, Polnareff.   We can't fall asleep, Mister Joestar.   Believe me.   Everyone...If we fall asleep, we'll be k*lled.   Please, you guys.You have to believe me.   Yes! My secret is still safe!   You guys lose!   Your petty mistrustjust cost you your lives!   Victory is mine, fools!   I can't believe it...    Does this mean Kakyoin can't fightor travel with us anymore?    We'll discuss it in the morning.    Time to sleep.    Polnareff, give me a handmoving Kakyoin.    Sure thing.    -Jotaro, you bring the sleeping bags.-Right.    You say something?    No. He's just really heavy.    -I'm gonna slice every one of you up...-I see.    ...and scatter your remainsall over the desert!    Why are we sitting aroundin the middle of an amusement park,    like a bunch of idiots?    That's right!    This is...    Jotaro! Mister Joestar!Be on your guard!    My memory's coming back.    We're in a dream world.    A horrible one.    We've entered a world of nightmares!    Oh, so it's just a dream.You had me worried there.    Don't make the same mistake I did!    Listen!Kakyoin was telling us the truth!    Baby. Stand.    We're in enemy territory.    I didn't believe it either,but that baby is a Stand user!    There's no one left to wake youfrom your slumber now.    Which means,they can't escape Death   !    I'll finally finish you all!    I knocked Kakyoin out!    He should already be here!    We've gotta find him!    Where are you, Kakyoin?    I've got to make this up to you!    Polnareff, good lord!What is going on with your hair?    Did you mess up brushing it?    Eh?    Polnareff!    -What?-My...    My prosthetic hand is...    Holy sh*t!    How are we supposed to fight him?    How?    Anything can happenin this world!    There are no rules.Nothing makes sense!    He has total controlover everything!    Wait.I remember there being one rule.    If he wants to slice us to pieces,    he'll have to use his Stand,    and nothing but his Stand!    Lali-ho!     DEATH   MANISHU BOOI    Lali-ho!    -Star...-Jotaro, it's no use!    It's impossible to bringour Stands into the dream world!    ...Platinum!    That's weird...His Stand manifested.    Lali-ho! I'm a fake!    The overwhelming power!The absolute terror!    It's so much fun!    A Stand is a manifestationof the mind.    And what are dreamsif not the mind laid bare?    My Death    has trapped youin your subconscious,    which is why you can'tsummon your Stands!    But...    had you summoned your Stands    before you fell asleep,    you could havebrought them with you,    like the clothes you're wearing,    sleeping bags,and your prosthetic hand.    Death    will never be forcedto face another Stand!    And only a Standcan defeat a Stand,    so I'll always come out on top!    Now...    How about you give me a scream?    One that capturesthe joy and elation    I'm about to feelat my easy victory!    Lali... ho?    Lali-ho!    Oh, it's just oneof the fakes I made.    What?    I don't understand!    This one doesn't seem to be a fake!     This is the real Hierophant!    It's normal!    Look, it's Kakyoin!    Kakyoin's right there!    Did you forget I'd summonedmy Hierophant    by the time I wasknocked unconscious?    I had it burrow undergroundto conceal itself.    Before I fell asleep, of course.    You can't do this!    Now, it's timefor your punishment, baby.    Damn that bastard!    Let go!    Give up, Death   !    I had Hierophant place himselfin your blind spot.    If you keep upthis futile struggling...    I don't care that you're a baby.I'll snap your neck!    Kakyoin!    Kakyoin.We owe you an enormous apology.    I thought you had lost your mind!    I couldn't take you at your word.    You were fightingthis battle alone.    And for that I'm sorry.    No, Polnareff.It couldn't have been helped.    I only realized how to bringa Stand into the dream    after you struck me with your fist.    So in a way,this is all thanks to you.    Really?    Now I feel conflictedabout the whole thing!    That's embarrassing...    He's going easy on mebecause I'm a baby.    Kakyoin, that compassion of yoursis a fatal flaw!    You're all still trappedin my nightmare world!    Uh oh, what's up with these clouds?    Those clouds...    They're changing shapeand closing in!    I'm warning you,don't try anything,    Death   !    Kakyoin!    You have to get Hierophantaway from his back!    How did?    I'll chop you in half!    Impossible!    How could he do that?    He chopped himself in half.    Kakyoin!    Lali-ho!    Haven't you figured it out?    Death   's body is hollow!    It has only a head,arms, and a scythe!    You gigantic ignoramuses!    Let's see.    Kakyoin's bodyshould also be split in two    inside the sleeping bag.    Nah, just kidding!    Kakyoin!    You sure you're all right?    Please take a closer look.    He wouldn't just clingto its back forever.    Surely you know my Hierophant'snot that careless.    He's not chopped in half!    He's turning into a string.    And he's slithering into my ear!    My arm is moving on its own.    He's invading my skull.    I told you before!    My Stand was in your blind spot,and your scythe couldn't cut him.    Now then, unless you'd liketo be destroyed from the inside out,    How about you healthe cuts on my arm?    Anything is possiblein a dream, right?    Healing a cut should be easy.    Right...    All right, everyone.Rise and shine!    Polnareff, up and at 'em!    There's a nice breakfast for you!    I feel like I had a terrible dream.    You and me both.    I'm drawing a blank,but I have the feeling it was terrifying.    Kakyoin!    -Are you okay?-I'm fine.    What?    You were acting likea deranged lunatic last night!    You even carved lettersinto your arm.    Huh?    The cuts are gone?    All right, I think I'll changethe baby's diaper now.    Huh?    It's morning, sleepy head.    He seems to be getting alongwith the baby.    Maybe I just dreamedthe whole thing...    Well then,did you have a good rest?    Oh, never mind!    Everyone's forgotten.    A Stand whose very existenceis completely forgotten...    What a strange creature.    But I haven't forgotten anything.    I suppose I am the only onewho brought his Stand into the dream.    Listen.Because you're just a baby,    I won't eliminate you.I won't even injure you.    We'll take you to a nearby town.    You need to be returnedto your mother.    But don't ever comeanywhere near us again.    If you do,you'll have to be punished.    In a manner such as this...    Is that my poop?    Oh, Kakyoin.    I see you've made somebaby food for the little lad!    Yes.    Good! I'm sure he must bestarving by now.    Hey... No, you wouldn't...    Eat up!These yum-yums are delicious!    Say ah!    Again? It's as if he doesn'tlike the stuff...    At this rate,I'll have to force-feed him.    Stop!    Hey, Mister Joestar.    If you force-feed him,he'll hate it even more.    In special cases like this...    Coochie-coochie-coo...    I told you it's delicious!    Ba-dum-tss.     HIEROPHANT GREENNORIAKI KAKYOIN    Joestar and the others have nowcrossed the Arabian Peninsula,    and are currently makingtheir way across    the Red Sea as they prepareto enter Egypt.    But!    Hey, old man. Something's off.    We're going the wrong direction.    I thought we were traveling west,straight to Egypt?    Looks like we're headingfor that island.    Yeah, you're right.    I've had my reasonsfor keeping this to myself,    but before we arrive in Egypt,we need to make a slight detour.    Someone is waitingfor us on the island.    He's someone importantto our journey.    "Someone important"?    I'm the one who let Avdol die.    There's no wayI can make up for that.    To thank you for freeing mefrom the lamp...    It's an actual treasure!    ...I'll grant you three wishes!    Can you bring someone back to life?
02x21 - Judgement, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:39Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Hey, old man.Something's not right.  We're going in the wrong direction.  It looks like we're headingfor that island.  But before we arrive in Egypt,we need to make a slight detour.  Someone is waiting for us.  He is a man who is extremelyimportant to our journey.  An important man?  Hey, what's the big deal?Does someone actually live here?   This is such a tiny island,it's practically deserted.   Agreed.   Mr. Joestar,are you sure someone lives here?   He's been living onthis island by himself.   A man told me back in India.   Huh? When you say a "man to--"   What?! Mangos from India?    EPISODE   :JUDGEMENT, PART     Hey!   Somebody's watching usfrom the bushes.   What?   Hey!   From the back, he looks...   Right. I know that face!   Hold on! Just wait!   Eat up, now.   Are you hungry, Michael?How about you Prince?   I mixed in your favorite,crushed sea shells, just for you!   There's more over here.   Make sure to get nice and fat,   so you'll be a tasty chicken,Lionel.   It's not possible... That man...   It can't be...   It can't be!   I'll go and talk with him.   The rest of you,just wait here for now.   My name is Joseph Joestar.   My friends and I are travelingon expedition to Egypt--   Go away! I won't hear it!   His voice sounds like...   Don't talk to me!   It's always bad newswhen someone comes to talk to me!   It's only when something terriblehas happened!   I don't want to hear it!   I said go!   Mr. Avdol!   Avdol...   Go away!   That's...   impossible!   That wasn't Avdol.   It was his father.   His father?   He withdrew from society,and lives alone on this island.   I'm sorry I wasn't able to tell yousooner...   but if it ever came known to Diothat we stopped at this place,   Avdol's father would be putin grave danger.   I would never forgive myselfif that happened.   But...   telling him what happenedto his son...   won't be easy...   Polnareff!   Avdol's death wasn't your fault.   No, it's entirely my fault.   I'll carry that burdenfor as long as I live.   Is it safe to assumehis father is a Stand user?   Yes, but I don't knowwhat sort of Stand it is.   Judging from his father'sreaction to us,   I doubt he'll offer usmuch assistance.   You just leave the talking to me.   Hopefully my wordswill be able to reach him.   All I wanted was to avengemy sister's death.   And I end up k*lling my friend.   There's nothing I could possibly doto make it up to his father...   Talk about depressing...   This thing is pretty shiny.   I wonder if it camefrom a ship wreck?   Just look at all these barnacles.   Looks like some sort ofmetal container...   It's got some sort ofweird face carved into it.   It might be worth something.   Now, if I can scratch offthese barnacles.   What the...   It's gone!   What in the worldhappened just now?   Guess the pressurized airinside just burst out.   It's not like it's Aladdin'smagic lamp or anything...   That really startled me!   You get three!   Three I say!   Your wish is my command!   Three wishes for whateveryour heart desires.   What sort of fresh hell is this?   I am known as Cameo.   Allow me to thank you forfreeing me from the lamp.   Now name three wishesyou'd like to come true...   So another Stand user!   Silver Chariot!   This guy's not half bad.   What awesome power...    Listen buddy!    Your strength tells me,your user is close by!    Now who is it?    Would you like the answerto that question    to be consideredas your first wish?    It's a little on the boring side,if you ask me.    Don't pull that"Genie in the bottle" crap with me!    Are you saying you couldmake me rich right now?    Huh?    Is that your first wish?    Let's see you do it!    Stop jerking me around, damn it!    Very well.Your wish shall be granted.    Wha...    What was all that about?    Was that thing a Standor wasn't it?    He's a strange one.    He didn't att*ck me,but told me to make three wishes.    I don't know what's going on,but I don't trust this guy.    Someone shady is on this island.    I should tell Mr. Joestarabout what just happened.    It could have something to dowith Avdol's father...    That's weird...    What's up with all thatloud clanging back there...    Is this for real?But it can't be!    This is gold fromthe Napoleonic era.    This isn't a dream or an illusion.    It's the real thing.A treasure trove of gold!    Are you mocking me or something?    No... Can't be.    When could he have buriedthis gold here?    No way he had time to bury itafter I made my wish.    How the hell didthat freak do all this?    Now, what is your second wish?    Your wish is my command.    Bastard!    Why are you doing this?What are you scheming?    I'm not falling foryour stupid tricks!    If you're my enemy,then fight me like one!    If not, I'll take this treasurefor myself.    I take it knowing the answer tothat question is your second wish?    Though, it's a little on the boring side,if you ask me.    But I owe you forletting me out of that lamp,    so I shall grant your wish.    You smug bastard!    All right then... I do have a wish...    I want to be a comic artist!    That was always my dreamwhen I was a kid!    I wanna be bigger than Disney!    Not some starving artist!    I'm gonna buildmy own Polnareff-land!    Wait, scratch that.    Just give me a second.    Any minute now... It'll come to me...    I want a girlfriend!    More than money or fame...    I want true love!    Not only someone who's really cute,    but a relationship connected bythe red string of love...    I want to meet a girl    who feels the same way about meas I do about her!    So grant that if you can, damn it!    You want a girl, do you?Very well.    Wait, no, never mind!I need more time.    The deceased...    Can you bring them back?    From the dead?    Am I to assume your wanting to know    the answer to that questionis your second wi--    Enough already!    I'm asking you to bringmy dead sister back to life!    And you can do the samefor my friend Avdol!    But that's just too muchfor you, right?    Very well.    I shall grant your wish.    What?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    So you can really... do it?    Indeed.But since you made two wishes,    I'll grant themin the order you asked.    First, I will grantyour second wish    to bring back your sister.    Hail to you!    Hold it! Who the hell are you?    Why are you--    What was that sound?    I'm sure I heardsomething rustling...    It sounded like someonewas digging up the ground...    There's that weird digging again!    Where's the sound coming from?    No... it can't be!    Is that a woman crying?    All right, who's there?    These are...    These are strands of hair...    A woman's hair.    A woman's footsteps...    Impossible!    There's no way...This can't be happening...    My little sister is still inher coffin back in France...    Just who the hell are you?    Answer me, now!    Please... stay away...    I'm in so much pain...    My body hasn't fully formed...    I know that voice...    Sherry!    Hey, where'd Polnareff get off to?    I couldn't find him up top.    It's already nightfall,and he's nowhere to be seen.    You don't think he ran into the enemy,do you?    Sherry...    Is it you?    It is you, isn't it?    Where are you going?    Where are you going, Sherry?    Wait Sherry! It's only me!    Sherry, why are you running away?    Come on, Sherry, please,show yourself!    Please, Sherry, wait!    Let me see your face...Let me see it one more time...    Brother!    Higher, brother!Raise me as high as you can!    Yay! Now spin me around!    Oh, it's simply wonderful!    I've been wanting a new umbrella.    Thank you for buying it for me.    I'm off, now.    Sherry!    What... the hell happened here?    They've been half eaten!    Sherry!    Can you hear me?Why are you running away?    It's me, your big brother!    Because... my body is covered in dirt...    And my hair... It's so unkempt...    It's okay, Sherry!Don't worry about that!    You're perfect just as you are.    Why are you crying?    Why are you sad, Sherry?    Sherry...    No.    Just stay back.    Don't come any closer!    What are you saying?You're not making any sense!    It's simple...    I'm saying you'll hate me.    Hate you?    Have I ever told youthat I hate you?    Yes.    When we were kids...    When I gave your favoritetropical fish to the cat...    You got really mad,and said you hated me.    I admit I was angry that day,    but I've always loved youmore than anything!    I still do!    Really?    You've always loved me?    Yes, of course I have!    You'll love me, no matter what?    I love you, no matter what.    And I can clearly see nowyou're the real Sherry.    You have no idea how muchI've missed you!    I see...    I feel the same, big brother.    Sherry, please look this way.    Show methat beautiful face of yours.    Why are you crying?Are you still sad?    Sad?    No, Brother.    These aren't tears of sadness.    What is it then...    I'm...    I'm happy, brother...    cause I can finally eat you!    Chariot!    Sher... ry...    I'm sorry that I bit you, brother.    I'm afraid my body'sstill underdeveloped.    But if I eat your flesh,I'll return to normal.    It's OK if I eat you, right?    You always did what I asked you to.    Cameo!    You rang?    You bastard!    What? Do you have a complaint?    I granted your wish, didn't I?    Granting wishes is my power,after all.    The rest is up to you.    Then I'll tell youmy third wish!    Make my sister...    Make my sister...    Let my sister rest in peace!Return her to her grave!    I don't think so!    What?    You still don't get it,do you Polnareff?    I'm a Stand!    I'm the Stand represented bythe Judgement card!     I extract wishes from the deepestcorners of the human mind,    and manifest themfrom the soil below.    You created your sisterfrom your own yearning!    How dare you...    And since you created her,I cannot undo it.    This match goes to me!    By the way...    I recall you saying somethingabout a third wish,    but you've already made    your third wish.    You...    You don't mean him...    When a man wishes from the heart,    all of his greatest weaknessescome to light.    -Because of you, I...-Avdol, I...    I never thought you'd be this hurt.    I'll get better if I eat, right?    Anything but the third wish...
02x22 - Judgement, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:39Quite the traumatic experience,isn't it?  Being eaten aliveby your very own sister.  When a man uncovershis deepest desires,  all of his weaknessesare laid bare.  You gave nary a thoughtto the depraved nature  of bringing someone back to life.  Everyone wants to believethat their loved ones  are still alive somewhere.  You hope that they'llsuddenly pop in tomorrow   and say, "Good morning."   By the way...   You said somethingabout a third wish,   but, if I'm not mistaken,you've already made said wish.   You mean...   You wished for Avdolto come back to life!   Hail to you!   No... He'sâ¦   Avdol!    Av... dol...    My fingers...   They've crumbled to pieces.   Polnareff!   I blame you for this!   Because of your bumbling, I...   I ended up like this!   Avdol... I...   I made you...   I...   You'll pay for this, Polnareff.   And you'll do it with...   your flesh!   I'll get better if I eat, right?   Right?   Big brother!   What's the matter, brother?   Stay away from me!   Both of you...Please go back to your graves!   Why? You're the onewho brought us back.   The time has come for youto enter your grave!   I was so panickedI forgot to summon Chariot.   How could I've beenso caught up in my wish   that I neglected to use my Stand?   Leave me alone!   Get away from me!   What?   "Please"? Oh no!   You don't have any wishes left!   I've already grantedyour three wishes.   You don't get any more!   Stop it!   Hail to you!   Go ahead. Writhe and screamto your heart's content!   You're in the middle of nowhere.   Your friends by the shorewon't hear you.   No one can save you now!   It's no use. This is the end...   I'm going to die. I'm finished.   Sherry...   Avdol...   I suppose it's what I deserve.   It's only fitting.   Avdol, it's like you said,you d*ed because of my actions.   And so... I've accepted my fate.   What...   My vision must be going.I'm seeing double.   It looks like there are two Avdols.   Of course there's not another one.   If I'm seeing things,guess it means the end is near.   The blood loss is taking its toll...   I'm hallucinating.   All right... This is it.   I'll have to tap out early.   Goodbye, Mr. Joestar,Kakyoin, Jotaro...   I pray for your victory.   As for you, Avdol...   I'll atone in the next world...   What? Impossible!   I was right!I knew I saw another Avdol!   My eyes weren't playing tricks!   Besides the dust and dirt version...   There's another Avdol!   Magician's Red!   But how? He's supposed to be dead!   He was stabbed bythe Hanged Man, Centerfold!   How the hell is he alive?   Tsk.   Mohammed Avdol!   Yes, I am!   Is it really you?   Tsk.   Tsk.   Is it the real you?   Polnareff,you haven't changed in the slightest.   You still lose all common sensewhen it comes to your sister.   No!   You're supposed to be dead!   Hanged Man sunkhis blade into your back,   and Hol Horse put a b*lletbetween your eyes,   k*lling you on the spot!    You're correct about my being sh*t.Right in the forehead...    But because I was stabbedin the back, for a moment,    my face was looking up,and the b*llet only grazed me.    I suppose this is what onewould call a blessing in disguise.    Hol Horse's b*llet broke my skin,scraping my skull.    It didn't reach my brain.It only grazed me.    But I did completelylose consciousness.    So you call yourself Cameoof the Judgement card?    Hell is near, so prepare!    Hell to you!    I know it was only the third wish,but still...    It's really him.    It came true!    JUDGEMENTCAMEO    Mohammed Avdol is indeedalive and well.    I would call this bad news.    Shouldn't you scurry awayto inform Dio    and your fellow Stand usercompatriots about my return?    Well, shouldn't you, Cameo?    That's right! I have to tell them!I have to let them know!    Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, and Jotaro!    This is very surprising news,to be sure.    But I can spin it this way:    Not only did Judgement's Cameoslay the idiot Polnareff.    He also succeededin eliminating Avdol,    who was actually alive!    I can't wait to tell themthe splendid news!    Magician's Red!    Whoa, there.    Avdol!    The Stand... It's far more powerfulthan I expected.    Careful!    It's not just his power.He's got incredible speed, too!    Come now, Avdol,is that the extent of your abilities?    It appears sharing my newswill be even easier than expected.    May fortune...    be with you both!    What?    Hail to you!    Big brother...    No. My Sherry...    Sherry... d*ed.    You're...    nothing but...    a hunk of dirt!    But brother...    Polnareff.    Apologies.    I take back what I saidabout you not changing.    No, you were right.    I'm the one who should apologize.    This battle hasalready been decided.    Avdol!I'd like to hear your three wishes!    Your wish is my command!    Until I put you to restfor good, that is!    Go ahead!You may as well give it a sh*t.    As I said, you get three wishes.    Bastard! He's making fools of us!    Just ignore him, Avdol!    You don't have to make any wishes!    Avdol, are you listening to me?    No good...    I want four wishes!    Wha...    What?    My wishes. Can't you hear?    I wish that I had four wishes.    Tsk.    You can't be serious...    Are you denying my wish?    Cameo, you're the onewho offered them!    I'm going to make sureyou keep your promise!    You still insist uponthis futile contest of power?    Your kicks are nothing!    What?    That's the way! Super!    Tsk.    My first wish was to make youcry out in agony.    And it came true.    This is madness! Your strength!    You're so much stronger!    The laceration the Hanged Manleft on my back...    hasn't completely healed yet.    I was guardingmy wound from as*ault,    and had to hold myself back some.    Wha...    I was finally able to stand againonly three days ago in India.    But since I took a plane here,the trip was rather easy.    That's, Avdol! Still the best!    Now, for my second wish...    I wish for you tocry out in utter terror!    Now for my third wish...    Cry in regret!    That bastard! He's running away!    Wait, damn it! Get back here!    Shh. Polnareff, quiet...    With that kind of power and speed...    given the rule of Stands...    the user must be hidingsomewhere nearby.    Is he here?    He should be hiding outvery close to us.    -Hey, could that be...-Shh!    The Stand useris hiding underground?    Why you!    You're gonna pay...    How dare you use my sister?Time to show you hell!    Hell to you!    Bastard!    I can think ofa few things to drop in...    Like dirt and sand...    A spider...    Ants too...    And a match.    Bastard! I hope you're ready.Your suffering has barely begun!    Hey, Polnareff.    I think I need togo to the bathroom.    Come on! How 'bout it, my friend?    Shall we engage in the timelessritual of male bonding?    Tsk.    Huh?    Somehow I made itout of that mess alive.    Come on, Polnareff!Let me hear you laugh!    Laugh, my friend!    Avdol... It seems likeyou're the one who's changed.    You would've never thoughtof doing something so perverse.    This isn't a result of youbeing sh*t in the head, is it?    That's it! Aim that thing!    Right!    Please forgive me!    Finally, my fourth wish. It's...    to not grant you a single oneof your pitiful wishes.    My magician's Red forgives no one.    Especially you.    Ba-dum-tss!     MAGICIAN'S REDMOHAMMED AVDOL    Hey! You guys'll never believe it!    Guess who I just ran into?    Polnareff!We've been worried about you!    How did you get those injuries?    Was it an enemy?    Who cares about my wounds?    Ready?Now don't be too shocked, Jotaro!    Promise you won't throwyour back out in surprise, Kakyoin!    Who do you think I met out there,Mr. Joestar?    Prepare to be blown away!    Tum-ta-da-da!    Here he is!    That sly bastard Avdolwas still alive!    Doo-do-doo!    Well, we should probably get going.    Here, allow me to help youcarry your luggage.    Hey, Avdol.    How ya been doing?    Avdol, is that wound on your backhealing up all right?    It's fine.I'm still a bit stiff, but...    Hey...    Has it really been two weeks?    -We're lucky to-Hey...    all be alive.    Jotaro, you're stillwearing your uniform?    Don't you ever get hot?    Hey, just hold up a second, guys!    I told you to hold on a second,you assholes!    What's with thoselaissez-faire attitudes?    A man we thought was dead is alive!    How can you just brush it offlike nothing ever happened?    Oh, sorry about that, Polnareff.    When I told youI buried Avdol in India...    I may have lied.    What?    Mr. Joestar and Jotarowere the ones    who tended to the wounds onmy head and back in India.    You assholes have known Avdolwas alive this whole time,    and you didn't tell me?    Kakyoin, you, too?    I only found outthe day after it all happened.    It was imperative to not letthe enemy know.    You have a big mouth,so I suggested...    Sorry, since you cannever tell a lie,    I suggested we keep ita secret from you.    If you'd let the secret slip,    Avdol wouldn't have beenable to recuperate in peace.    We were planning to tell youas soon as we knew he was safe,    but we didn't thinkyou'd run into him first.    Oh, yeah, Avdol!    Your dad's on this island!    Let's tell him you're here!    Oh, that was just me in disguise.    Say what?    Then all that was for show?    Go away!    It's always bad news whensomeone comes to talk to me!    I don't want to hear it!    Avdol's death wasn't your fault.    You didn't have to go that far!    How dare you leave meout of the loop?    Now, now.There's no reason to cry.    I'm sorry.I didn't think you'd be this hurt.    I apologize as well.    But I had a very good reason forcoming to this island in disguise.    Yeah, what?    It was partially so the enemywouldn't find out,    but I also had Avdoldo some shopping for me.    What kind of shopping?    It was a veryconspicuous acquisition.    So I disguised myselfas a wealthy Arab gentleman.    All right, everyone!Let's climb aboard and head out!    Polnareff, cheer up already.Come on.    It's almost here!    What's almost here?    I don't see anything...    What?    A submarine?    That's right! From here on out,we're riding to Egypt in this!    You've gotta be kidding!How'd you afford this?    How about this glistening design?    A submarine, huh...    Perhaps a refreshing whitewould be best.    Hurry up and make some coffee.    I just don't knowwhich one to pick.    Kakyoin, why are youtaking that cup?    Hello? Oh, is that you, Joseph?
02x23 - High Priestess, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:40Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Tum-ta-da-da!  Here he is!  That sly bastard Avdolwas still alive!  Doo-do-doo!  Mr. Joestar and Jotarowere the ones  who tended to the woundson my head back in India.  I also had Avdoldo some shopping for me.  From here on out,we're riding to Egypt in this!   You've got to be kidding!How'd you afford this?    EPISODE   :THE HIGH PRIESTESS, PART     The Red Sea.   It's what diversacross the globe have called   the most beautiful seain the world.   Flanked on the east and westby desert,   it was once believed to besurrounded by crimson sands.   Today, it's generallack of pollution   and inflowing river watermake its waters pristine.   Avdol, do you knowhow to steer this thing?   Tsk.It's no problem whatsoever.   And Avdol's not the only one!   Don't even think about it.   You're not putting usthrough another crash.   You sure seem to bein a foul mood!   So this is a submarine...   I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.   It's a lot more spaciousthan I expected.   Isn't it? Rich folks use them whenthey want to get away for a while   and explore the sea floorfor pleasure.   As you see, it even has windows.   -Oh! Nice!-Whoa there!   You know, I've always sort ofliked this kind of thing.   Though, I wish I could'veridden in one with a cute girl...   Once again,you haven't changed, Polnareff.   Can you try just this onceto take things seriously?   What's that?   This is sonar.   It uses reflected sound waves   to detect underwater objects,like radar.   Wow...   All clear.   I'm not picking up anythingin our vicinity.   With this machine, we can detectanyone trying to att*ck us,   from any direction.   But if someone didatt*ck us in here,   we'd have nowhere to run.   Don't forget, we are    metersbelow sea level.    It is amazing...   But I guess it isa cruiser for the wealthy.   It has a refrigerator,coffee maker...   It's even equipped withthe latest in satellite phones.   Hey, Kakyoin, get me a drinkwhile you're up, will ya?   I'm dying of thirst here.   -I'll take one, too.-All right.   Is cola okay?   Old man.   Why are you just standing there?   Men, I need you to give mea moment of quiet.   I just remembered I need tomake a phone call.   A phone call? To where?   Who would you need to callfrom all the way down here?   Someone important, I assure you.   You might even call ita delicate matter.   Again, I need you all to be quiet.   Oh, heaven's me...Which one should I pick?   The sparkly designis much more to my liking,    but is it appropriate forthe charity event tomorrow?   Perhaps a refreshing whitewould be better...   Oh, what do you think, Rosas?   Both of the gownslook lovely on you, Madam.   Coming!   Hello?   Oh, Joseph, darling, it's you!   Where have you been?And where are you calling from?   It's a bit...   hard to hear you.   Right, sorry... I'm at a hotel.   I hate to say it, but...   I have to attend someunexpected business that's come up.   Oh, goodness. It must be difficult   traveling to another countryright after going to Japan...   It's been nearly a month,hasn't it?   Yes. I'm sorry.   By the way, Suzie...   Have you spoken to Holly?   Yes, I just spoke to heron the phone yesterday.   She mentioned catching a cold   that's developed intoa bout of pneumonia.   She tried convincing meit's not serious,   but I think I might visit her.   No, don't. There's no need for that.   I'm positive she'llrecover quickly.   -You're such a worrywart...-This is what he meant by "delicate"?   Indeed. Madam Joestar   is still as effervescent as ever.   So he checks in now and again   to ensure she doesn't visitMiss Holly in Japan.   That way she's protected from the truth.   Are you saying that she...?    I am.    She hasn't been told anything.    We needn't worry her unnecessarily.    There's nothing to worry about.    Well, if you say so....    All right, I understand!    I'll hold off on going to Japan!    By the way, Joseph,I have something I need to ask you.    I'm having difficultydeciding between    the white dress and the purple one...    Is that so?Suzie, I need to speak to Rosas.    -What?-Madam.    Have you considered wearingyour blue dress?    I think it's inthe back of the closet.    That's right.I'll go and have a look.    Hello, Master Joseph. It's me.    Where's Suzie?    She's left the room, sir.    She won't overhearour conversation now.    I see...    Actually, I'm callingfrom the submarine    we spoke of a while back.    Then I take it you were successfulin reuniting with Master Avdol?    Yes.    Now then, tell me abouthow Holly's doing.    Have you gotten hold of the doctorsfrom the Speedwagon Foundation?    Well, actually...    On the phone, Miss Holly saysshe has nothing more than a cold.    She is quite insistent...    But her condition worsensby the day.    Master Joseph!    Don't you think the time has cometo tell Madam Joestar the truth?    No.    There's no needto get her riled up.    We are going to putan end to all this very soon.    I want Holly to go back    to her normal life.    Don't inform my wife of what'sgoing on under any circumstances.    I'll call again soon.    If that is what you wish.    I pray for your safe return.    Oh, Rosas, did you hang up already?I wasn't finished talking to him!    Oh, Madam...    It's no matter.Why don't we have some tea?    You will join me for a cup,won't you, Rosas?    -Oh?-Madam!    Don't trouble yourself.Allow me to serve the tea to you.    Really?    I'm sorry you have to do that,Mr. Joestar.    But you can rest easy,'cause we're right here behind you.    We'll be in Egyptbefore you know it!    We must defeat Dioas soon as we can,    and save Miss Holly from his curse.    I have returned from the brink,for this very reason!    Thanks, you guys, really.    Driving this isactually pretty easy!    Guess that's how you weremaking it look so simple, Avdol.    For Pete's sake!    Hey, don't get so carried away!    The sea is riddledwith potential hazards!    Yeah, yeah.    All right!Let's speed this tub up a b--    Polnareff!    I had nothing to do with that!    I'm so tired.Tell me we're almost there...    One, two, three, four, five...    Oh, exactly five cups in here.    Hey!    Hurry up and make the coffee, man!I want some now!    Make it yourself!    Good news! I've just spottedthe coast of Africa!    We'll be there soon!    Near this coral reef,    lies a natural undersea channel.    The exit istwo hundred meters inland.    We can surface there.    We've finally made it to Egypt.    It took long enough.    So this is Egypt...    Yes, we have arrived.    -What's so funny?-Nothing.    I'm just feeling sort of happy,that's all.    It's been a whilesince the five of us    were all gatheredtogether like this.    Hey, Kakyoin.    Why'd you grab six cupsfor five people?    That's peculiar.I guess I didn't notice.    I could have sworn it was five...    -Wh---What?    -Old man!-Mr. Joestar!    Impossible!    It's a Stand!    I don't know how,but it managed to sneak on board!    -Now it's gone!-No, it didn't!    It transformed!    It disguised itselfas one of the gauges!    Just like with the coffee cup!    Come again?    The coral reef!    And we were a few     metersfrom reaching Egypt!    Luckily, it looks like Mr. Joestarwas only knocked unconscious.    The problem is his hand.    The phone?    Who'd be calling us now?    Ignore it, Polnareff!    We have to stay focused!    It's the High Priestess.    Our enemy is using a deadly Standcalled The High Priestess.    So you know it well?    Somewhat.    The name of this particularStand user is Rose.    She has the ability to controlher Stand from far away,    so she's most likely on land.    What's its power?    It can turn into almostany inanimate object,    as long as it comes from a mineral.    Plastics, metal, glass, or vinyl.    There's no way to recognize it,until it decides to att*ck.    But how'd it sneak aboardin the first place?    I get it now,so that's how it did it.    How simple...It cut a hole and moseyed on in?    The ballast tanks are damaged!    We're sinking even faster!    Not to mention we're losing oxygen!    We can't go on like this!    Shut up! Whoever's callinghas horrible timing!    Jotaro?    Hey! Anything we touchcould be the--    Hi again, Joseph, it's me!    We weren't finished withour conversation,    so I made Rosas give me the number.    Why aren't you speaking?    Come to think of it, what's withall the ruckus over there?    Is that a... siren I'm hearing?    And that running water...Is your bathtub overflowing?    Sorry, but the old mancan't come to the phone.    I know that voice... Is that you...    Jotaro? Where's Joseph?    You should be in Japan.    Why are you with your grandfather?    Jotaro, answer me!    There's nothin' to worry about,Grandma Suzie.    He'll be fine.I'm right here with him.    Later.    We'll call backonce things calm down.    Jotaro!    Brace yourselves!We're about to hit the bottom!    Oh my God!    I knew this would happen!    Every vehicle we usegets destroyed!    I'm never riding ina submarine again.    HIGH PRIESTESSROSE    How strange...    I was getting through a moment ago.    It's as thoughthe line's suddenly gone dead.    But...    And why was Jotaro...    Hey, the oxygen'sgetting thin in here.    Kakyoin.    Did you catchwhich one of the gauges    the Stand merged with?    It looked likeit turned into this one.    That's not it! Jotaro!    It's already moved!    It's right behind Kakyoin!    Hierophant Green!    Kakyoin!    Everyone, head for the door!    It's traveling acrossthe machines' surface!    You say that, but...    If we stay in this room,    there's a very good chancewe won't survive!    Kakyoin, are you all right?    Yes...    Everyone, get to the next room!    We'll seal the room off,and trap it inside!    There's no way!    It already moved to the doorand transformed into the wheel...    I have to let gobefore it's too late!    Its claws wereable to slice through    Mr. Joestar's prosthetic hand...    What?    Yes! We got it!    That was close...    Apparently, our little friend hereisn't as fast as Star Platinum.    So, what should we do with it?    Jotaro, what are you waiting for!    Show no mercy!    Hurry up andrip its little head off!    Aye-aye, sir.    That bastard...    It turned into a freakin' razor!    Damn...    It's strong!    I can't believeit outsmarted Jotaro!    What an enemy...    What the hell is going on?    Whatever's happening here,I'm pretty sure we're in a pinch.    Shut up, old man!    The beast will att*ck usif we touch it.    Meaning we must useour Stands instead!    Magician's Red!    Silver Chariot!    It's a tough one!    Chariot's rapiercan't pierce its armor!    Pick up the pace!    We have to att*ckbefore it gets away!    Everyone, stand back!    There's still someoxygen over here.    It's going to run out soon!    -Are you all right?-Yeah.    Forget it, Jotaro!It'll only transform again.    We're taking on water fast,so we need to trap that thing!    We'll figure outhow to fight it then!    Know that it'll be Jotaro Kujo    who'll hammer youinto a bloody pulp.    What did you say?    Jotaro, why in the hell would youanswer a call from Suzie?    Damn it... You reallyshouldn't have done that!    Whatever....    We'll talk about itwhen we get out of this mess.    Leave everything to me!    Do you have a plan?    You bet... And it's a brilliant one.    Joseph Joestar has gotten throughsituations like this    more than once in his life!    I can't begin to understand whyJotaro is with Joseph?    Has Joseph said anything?    No, Ma'am...    Though... My heart jumped with joyto hear that boy's voice.    I heard he's beenquite the handful,    but deep down he's a sweet childwho cares very much for his family.    I'm sure he's helping Josephas much as he can.    Yes, Madam.    Master Jotaro and Master Josephare most likely    in the midst of battlinga common enemy as we speak.    They're fightingto save Miss Holly,    someone very dear to them,    from a curse of unbridled evil.    What do we do now?    I have a feelingthat devil of a Stand    isn't really the one trapped here.    Sooner or later, that monster'llcut its way out of that room    and catch up to us!    Being sealed off withall this machinery    makes us sitting ducks in here!    The submarine is done for!    We need to abandon ship and escape!    We'll have to findsome other way to Egypt!    We're    meters below sea level!    It doesn't sound that bad,    but how are we supposed toget out of here?    We're really gonna scuba dive?    I've never done anything like this...    Hurry everyone!Suit up on the double!    Good grief.    I just realized I won't be able tosuit up in time    with this busted hand.    Help me out, Jotaro.    Do it yourself.    First of all,make sure not to panic.    The ocean floor is so beautiful...    If it's OK, you'll do this...    If we're in trouble, do this.    I think I'd like to seeyour face sometime.
02x24 - High Priestess, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:41Anyone else getting nervous?  Try to stay calm.  Times like these require usto keep our heads on straight  and be prepared.  Putting this stuff on with one handis a lot harder than it looks.  So has anyone everscuba dived before?  Not me.  -No.-I haven't.  The High Priestess willbreak through any moment!   You have to teach ushow to dive now!   Try and calm yourself, Avdol.   You must never panic,no matter what.   This is the most important rulewhen scuba diving.   When you're underwater,   for every ten metersyou go below the surface,   the corresponding pressureincreases along with you.   The surface pressurestarts at one atmosphere.   We're    meters belowthe surface right now,   so we'll endurefive atmospheres of pressure.   If we surface too quickly,   the pressure'll cause our lungsand blood vessels to burst.   We have to rise slowlyso our bodies can adjust.   We're nearing the Egyptian coast.   It's best to ascendalong the sea floor.   OK...   I'm letting the water in.   You're looking at a regulator.   The valve inside allows air in fromthe t*nk only when you inhale.   The air you breathe out existsthrough the piece on the left.   What about spit?   What happens if I need to droolor hock a loogie or something?   That stuff comes outthe opening here.   And, this should go without saying,but we can't talk underwater.   Instead, we'll use hand signals.   Let's keep things simpleand use two.   When things are going smoothly,we'll use this to say "OK."   When they aren't, use this.   Mr. Joestar, couldn't we justuse our Stands to communicate?   Oh yeah, I didn't think about that.   Aww, man! And I was about to sayI know a really good hand signal.   He says,"Your underwear is showing."   Yeah!   We could be att*ckedand k*lled at any moment!   Stop fooling around and let's go!   This room is about to befilled to the brim with water.   Put your masks and regulators on.   Polnareff!    EPISODE   :THE HIGH PRIESTESS, PART      When did...   The Stand had already integratedwith the regulator!   That bastard...   It's gonna rip him apartfrom the inside!   sh*t!   Drain the room!   It's too late!   It must have been lying in waitfor just this moment!   Crap!   It managed to burrowinside Polnareff!   It'll tear out his guts!   What should we do?   Hierophant Green!   Hermit Purple!   Hey...   I grabbed it before it wenttoo far down his throat!   Me, too!   Let's pull it outbefore it transforms!   Success!   All right, keep it just like that!   Look!   It's transforminginto something else!   You've got to be kidding me!It turned into a spear g*n!   Emerald Splash!   Silver Chariot!   Let's get moving!   It's already reloading!   It doesn't quit!   Hurry!   Move it, old man!   Yeah, I'm coming!   That was too close...   It's too soon for us to relax.   The bastard knows exactlyhow to hit us where it hurts most.   Polnareff, you all right?   Yeah, I'll be fine...   You guys saved me back there.   Merci beaucoup.   Just look at how beautifulit is down here.   This would've made a spectacularplace to visit on vacation.   Plan your next getawayanother time!   We have to surface beforewe run out of oxygen.   Think we're safe?   I believe so.   The High Priestess can transforminto metals and glass,   but it can't take the formof bubbles or fish.   Just keep your eyes peeled.   If it pursues us,   it'll probably transform intoa screw on our gear.   Be careful of moving pebblesand stones, too.   Look! I think it's the sea tunnel!    We're at seven meters.    We've finally reachedthe Egyptian shore!    We can swim along these rocksto the surface!    What?    Is that the...    It's the Stand!It merged with the sea floor!    And it's gargantuan...    It's pulling us into its mouth!    This is impossible!    How is it so gigantic?    The hell?    It's colossal! This power!    It was so small before!    You boys are so slow on the uptake!    Didn't it cross your mindsthat if the rocks are mineral,    it would mean the sea bedis mostly mineral, too?    If the Stand is this powerful,the Stand user must be close!    And I'd wager,she's closer than we think!    You guessed it!    I'm seven meters above you,on the shore!    But since you're about to be groundto bits by my High Priestess,    you'll never have a chanceto see my face!    I can't tell what partof the Stand we're in.    Seems like we'restill inside its mouth.    Luckily, we weren'tsucked down its gullet.    Hey, Jotaro!    You're just my type,    so this is going to be as painfulfor me as for you.    It's too bad I have to makethe High Priestess digest you.    If only things were different.    How sad!    But if I k*ll you,Lord Dio will shower me with praise.    So don't hate me!    Good grief, do I have to?    Just say it!    Come on, hurry, get on with it!    Say what?    I see...    Rose,    I wish I could've seen your face,if only once.    You might've been my type, too.    I just might've fallen for you.    I bet she's a beauty!    I can tell from that voice of hers.    Yes. She comes acrossas an elegant woman.    My fortune teller's instinctsenses it.    If you ask me, she soundsjust like Audrey Hepburn.    Man, if I were only   years younger.    You bastards! You don't meana single word of that!    I'll k*ll you all!    Holy sh*t!    Everyone, look!    What's that?    It's a tongue!    It's the Stand's tongue!Here it comes!    Jotaro!    Jotaro!    Jotaro's going to land in...    He landed right on the molars!    Jotaro! Get outta there!    You'll be crushed!    You want to pit your strengthagainst mine, do you?    Damn, such crazy power...    Jotaro! These teeth areas hard as diamonds!    You'll never be able to break them!    I'll crush you to death!    We have to save Jotaro!    Get outta my way!    That damn tongue again!    Magician's Red!    We're outta time!    Pull him out of there!    -Jotaro!-Jotaro!    HIGH PRIESTESSROSE    Those giant teethpulverized Jotaro!    Jotaro...    We didn't make it in time!    Hold on a sec.I think I hear something.    It sounds as ifit's coming from far away...    I think it's getting closer.    That voice belongs to...    The teeth!It's coming from inside the teeth!    Everyone, brace yourselves!    Huh?    They were hard as diamonds,and he still punched his way out!    Oh, my God!    And look!    He's busting the rest of them!    That show off...    His Stand's immense powernever ceases to amaze me.    C'mon, I'm getting usout of this hell hole!    Good grief.    Well, you were right aboutthose teeth being sturdy,    but they weren't sturdy enough.    Guess your so-called diamondswere a little low on calcium.    You couldn't pay meto do that again...    Hey, there's a womanpassed out over there.    I assume it's Rose,the user of the High Priestess.    Should we leave her?She looks harmless.    I think I'll go seeif she's hot or not!    Looks like she's gota pretty nice body.    Let's see...    Well? Polnareff?    No comment...    Stop! Don't look!    Her teeth are all busted!Don't even bother!    Well, we've finally made it to Egypt.    Indeed.    What would've takena mere    hours by plane,    ended up takinga whopping    days.    It's been quite the adventure.    We've gone inside a brain,and even inside our dreams.    Our dreams?    What do you mean, Kakyoin?    What's all this about dreams?It's morning, wake up already!    Oh, right. You guysdon't remember that.    Whatever. Let's go.    The Stand.    An otherworldly essence,powered by the mystical,    symbolized by the Tarot.    Around the World in    Days.    So was Joseph Joestar's descriptionof their globe-trotting journey.    From Tokyo to Hong Kong,they faced Tower of Gray.    On the seas to Singapore,    they tackled Dark Blue Moonand Strength.    In Singapore, they encounteredEbony Devil and Yellow Temperance.    In Calcutta, India, it wasHanged Man and Emperor.    In Varanasi, India, the Empress.    And near the Pakistani border,they fought Wheel of Fortune.    In the mountains of Pakistan,they battled Justice.    In Karachi, Pakistan, the Lovers.    In the desert ofthe United Arab Emirates, the Sun.    And in Saudi Arabia, Death   .    On a small island inthe Red Sea, Judgement.    And now, on the Red Sea floor,they've defeated High Priestess.    With several ofDio's assassins vanquished,    they have finally arrived in Egypt.    Only a few Tarot Cards remain.    But little do Jojo and crew know,    new threats lie ahead,ready to take our heroes on.    That's...    One, two, three... nine.    There are nine in all.Both genders...    Huh?    What... is that?    Have the meddlesome fliesswarming about been swatted?    The Speedwagon Foundation...    For pity's sake. I can't letmy guard down for a minute.    I've gotten quiteused to this body.    Tell me, Jonathan, can you feel it?    Your descendantsare inching ever closer.    It can be so cruel and unforgiving...    This wretched little world of ours.    So that's what's been going on!    Why didn't you just tell me Jotarowas helping you with work?    That's fantastic!    The boy still has a long way to go,compared with me.    So, this work is important enoughfor you to ask for help?    That's right.    It's my most important mission yet.    It's imperative thatwe don't mess up.    But as long as we work together,we should get the job done.    Say, Joseph.Could I speak to Jotaro?    Sure, but what about?    Nothing much.    Is it wrong that I want to hearmy darling grandson's voice?    Well, no.    Jotaro.    It's me.    Grandpa told me everything, Jotaro!    Work hard. And take care ofyour grandfather for me.    Will do.    I know in my heartif you work together,    you Joestar men can overcomejust about any hardship.    I truly believe that.    Grandma Suzie, you...    Hm? What's the matter?    You sound so seriousall of a sudden.    It's nothing.    All right, I'm hanging up.I look forward to good news. Ciao!    Madam...    It's already been    years    since I've workedfor the Joestar family.    But I can honestly say    we've never faced somethingof this magnitude.    Oh, come now, you're overreacting.    Didn't he sayit's just a business trip?    Well I...    It's so troublesomewhen men refuse to tell us anything.    But I'm used to it all by now.    The Joestar family has beenlike this for an entire century.    I'm sure if she were here,    she'd say the sameand laugh it all off.    What's the matter, Jotaro?    It's nothing.    All right, it's time to head out!    After a century,    it's time for us Joestars to bringan end to Dio's grip on our family!    But we don't have to do it alone.    Hey, Mr. Joestar!    We got the car!    Let's hurry and hit the road!    We should probablyget to where we're going    before it gets too dark.    Old man.    -Guess we are-If you don't hurry up,    -pretty lucky.-we're gonna leave you behind.    Yeah, yeah, we're coming.    This is the land of Egypt:a nation   % desert.    But, thanks tothe blessings of the Nile,    beautiful, fertile greenspreads across    the entirety of its river banks.    In addition to the cultureof the ancient Egyptians,    Egypt is home to Persian, Greek, Roman,    Muslim, and Arabian cultures.    All have lefttheir indelible marks.    In this eternal land,    what bizarre adventuresand challenges await Jotaro and crew?    EGYPT ARC
02x25 - Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'Doul, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:41It's about time.   EPISODE   : IGGY THE FOOLAND GEB'S N'DOUL, PART    What's that?  They're here.  It's a helicopter!  No need to tell us.  They're here fromthe Speedwagon Foundation.  They're looking forsomewhere to land.  Speedwagon Foundation?   The group looking after Momback in Japan?   Your old friends?   You got it.   Don't tell mewe're taking a copter now.   No. As much as I'd like to,they're not Stand users.   We can't put them in harm's way.   So why are they here?   They've brought us an ally.   What? An ally?   He's a bit of a handful;   that's why it tookso long to fetch him.   Mr. Joestar!   You aren't seriously consideringtaking him with us!   He'd only hold us back.   So you know him, Avdol?   Yes, all too well.   Hold on.You mean he's a Stand user?   That's right.And his card is the Fool.   The Fool?   The Fool?   Sounds like a dumb card to me.   Just be glad he's not your enemy.   You can't b*at him.   What'd you say, you assh*le?   You'd better watch your mouth.   It's the truth.   Now move your hand.You're hurting me.   -Who made you boss...-Enough!   The helicopter's here.   Good to see you, Mr. Joestar!   Thanks for bringing himall the way here.   So...   Which one of you is it?Who's the Stand user?   I said, which one of youis the Stand user?   You?   It's not us.   He's in the back.   The back ...   I don't see him.   No, he's there.   Hey, hey, hey!   Come on! Quit joking around.   Is he really short or something?   Come out, come outwherever you are!   Watch out!   Huh?   What's this sticky stuff?   Please, be careful, sir!   The helicopter ride was rough,so he's in a really foul mood.   Get away from him!   I told you he's trouble!   Polnareff, remember,you can't b*at him.   I'm just asking where he is...   Huh?   He's...   ...a dog!   Don't tell me this dog is....   Yes, this dog possessesthe Stand of the Fool.   His name is Iggy.   He's crazy about ripping chunksof hair out of people's heads.   I don't know where he's from.   But Avdol found him in New York.   None of the dog catcherscould catch him.   Avdol was the only one who could.   Oh, I should mention.   When he rips people's hair out,he sorta likes to...   ...pass wind in their faces.He's kinda dirty.   You little mutt!You're gonna pay for that!   Damn you...   Chariot!   That's...   So that's The Fool.   We fought an orangutan Stand userback in Singapore, but...   Who does this stupid muttthink he is?   Don't make me turn youinto dog meat!   What the--It turned into sand!   I can't cut him!   And now he's solidifiedand caught my rapier!   That's...   It's a Stand made of sand.   I see... So the simpler their makeup,the stronger they become.   I'm not sure I could land a punch.   Hey! Help! Get this dog off me!   Sorry, Polnareff,   but I thinkI'll hold on to my hair.   You monster!   Did you bring his favorite snack?   Of course. He wouldn't havecome with us otherwise.   Stop! Help me!   He has a keen sense of smell.    What is that?    Iggy loves coffee-flavored gum.    He'll do just aboutanything for it.    Mr. Avdol,hide the packet before you--    Blast it!He grabbed the whole thing!    He loves his coffee-flavored gum.    People on the other hand...    At least take the wrapping off.    Now how is he going to help us?    -Good grief.-Damn it...    He's ruined my beautiful hair...    This bastard!    He's distracted, as long ashe's chewing his gum.    Let's get the supplies out now.    Here's water and food for the trip.    Oh, thank you.    There are medical suppliesand a change of clothes, too.    Also, a new camera to usewith your Stand.    A lot easier thanusing a TV, right?    Oh, I know.    Hey, men!    Ah, the perfect memento.    Avdol! Hurry up with the gum!    But you're already such good friends,Polnareff!    All right, Mr. Joestar,we're heading back.    Before you leave,I have something to ask you.    It's about my daughter...    How is Holly holding up?    And don't hold back.    Yes, sir...    Well, I'm afraidshe's not doing well.    She's losing strength rapidly.Nothing they do seems to help.    Our doctors atthe Speedwagon Foundation    say she has two weeks.    There's no time.    Damn it...    I have some other informationas well.    Our investigators say that,two days ago...    nine unidentifiedmen and women gathered    in a building believedto be Dio's hideout.    Apparently they leftand disappeared.    Dio and nine others?    We have no informationon their identities.    The spy who reported thiswas then promptly k*lled,    and the mansion had alreadybeen vacated.    We were unable to locatethe nine men and women.    Our spies aren't Stand users,so we couldn't tail them.    What, they're Stand users?    Hold on.    They can't be.Except for the Emperor,    the only tarot cardthat remains is The World.    I suspect that is Dio's card, but...    Avdol?    I don't know.    I'm astounded.Nine more Stand users?    It seems, Dio's head has yet to adjustto his new body.    He would never run from us.He's far too conceited.    He's going to do everythinghe can to keep us out of Cairo.    Good grief. Nine Stand usersin two weeks, eh?    That's one hell of a whirlwind tour.    We'll be off, then.    Godspeed, sir.    Thank you. Look after my Holly.    That mutt...    So it sniffed outthe Great N'doul, eh?    So close.    I almost caught it this time.    Just a bit more practice and...    The Tsetse Fly...    It's because of these fliesthat Joestar and his friends    uncovered Master Dio's locationin Egypt...    THE FOOLIGGY    Mr. Joestar,do something about him!    Why does this piece of sh*tget to sit in the seat    while we're stuck in the trunk?    It's so cramped, my back hurts.    You'll just have to wait untilthat coffee flavor runs out.    When it has,    throw some more gum into the trunkto lure him back there    and switch seats.    All right, all right.Calm down! Damn it...    What the hell?    Look! Over there!    That's...    The helicopter!    The Speedwagon Foundationhelicopter went down!    I see no sign of expl*si*nor g*nf*re.    It looks like it justfell out of the sky.    Could it be?    Be careful!    You can bet it was att*ckedby an enemy Stand!    Look! It's the pilot!    He's dead...    And whatever happened to him,it wasn't pretty...    The poor fellow.    Approach carefully.    Something could be hiding there.    It's water.    All this water...and from one person's mouth...    No, the water must befrom his lungs.    Where'd the fish come from?    He drowned inthe middle of the desert!    What on earth?    Hey...    The other guy's over here.    He's alive!    Talk to us! Hang on!    Tell us what happened!    Wa...    Water...    What? You want water?    Polnareff, hand me that canteen.    Huh? Right.    Here, just hang in there.Here's some water.    Drink it slowly.    No! The water att*cked us!    What?    It's a Stand!    The enemy Standis inside the canteen!    Damn it!    They were just innocent bystanders.    Why did it k*ll them!    Avdol, did you seewhat kind of Stand it was?    All I saw was a hand.    But I think it's stillinside the canteen!    I haven't seen it leave.    Who could it be?    So Dio met withnine men and women...    Could one of them be the assassin?    Jotaro, find the Stand user.    I'm already on it.    But...    I don't seethe Stand user anywhere.    When we battledthat idiotic Sun stand,    he was hiding behinda mirror, but...    it seems this timethe enemy's far away.    Polnareff, slice up the canteen.    Huh? Me?    The pilot's head was suckedinto that tiny little container.    If I poke a hole in that thing...    No way!    Kakyoin! You're closer!    Just use your Emerald Splash!    I don't want to.    Don't make me do somethingjust because you don't want to do it!    What's going on with you?    No means no.    Well, I already told you,I'm not gonna do it, either!    That's the...    Kakyoin!    It's the water!    It had already left the canteen.It hid itself in the blood!    The Stand wasn'thiding in the water...    It is the water!    It got Kakyoin!    It got Kakyoin's eyes!    Polnareff! Don't panic!    Summon Chariotand protect yourself!    Crap.It's going to get Polnareff, too.    What's going on?It att*cked the pilot's corpse!    No, not the corpse. The watch.    It att*cked the watchbecause of the alarm.    Sound! It huntsits victims by sound!    Sound?    sh*t! Polnareff!    It's coming for you this time!    Get to the car!    It's so fast!    Hurry, Polnareff!    It got me!    Hermit Purple!    It disappeared into the ground...    It detects sound throughvibrations in the ground.    And it moves through the earthwhere we can't see it.    It can att*ck us from behind    or from below at any moment.    What's worse,the Stand user could be far away.    So they've sought refugeatop that car.    Seems they've realizedthat I, N'doul,    am hunting them with sound.    No matter.It's all futile anyway...    How's Kakyoin?    It's not good.    He may have been blinded.    Let's drive.    We have to get himto a doctor immediately.    But if we move, it'll att*ck.    We can't afford to be careless.    What?    Hm? That sound...    It's the dog.    It left the car before I att*cked.    It anticipated my Stand's att*ck.    Seems this dog is going to bequite the nuisance.    The tires are in the water! sh*t!    It's no use. It's pulling us in!    I can't hold on much longer!    Everyone, move to the back!    Hey, flea bag!    You're supposed to help us,damn it! Help, already! Hey!    That accursed dog...    It knows I'm four kilometersto the west of them.    Oh, what to do...    Perhaps I should do awaywith the dog first!    Go ahead, get comfortablewhile we fight for our lives!    You stupid dog!    No, forget the dog.    Joestar and the otherscan't control that mangy mongrel.    It's harmless.All it cares about is taking a nap.    Now, for the k*ll...    It's so sharp! That water justslashed our front tires!    Get back now!    So that's what it's trying to do...    sh*t! Everyone hang on!    I can hear it!    Don't make a sound.    He can smell where the enemy'sgoing to att*ck next.    The water started chasing Jotaro!    If we can just find their body,    there's a good chance we can defeatthat fearsome Stand!    It's Iggy.
02x26 - Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'Doul, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:42Everyone, hold on!  Oh no!  It sunk into the sand...Don't move!  Don't make a sound!  It's much too late now.  I know exactlywhere each of you landed.  Four... Five steps.  You're walking ever so quietly.  But I hear you.   These "steps" musthave thrown him.   Cursed water Stand!Go ahead and att*ck.   I'll vaporize youwith Magician's Red   the moment you show yourself.    EPISODE   :IGGY THE FOOL AND GEB'S N'DOUL, PART     He's here!   Wait. Why did he takeonly five steps?   Why has he stopped moving?   Now!   Magician's Red!   What?   What--   Avdol...   He's so...   So quick...   Avdol!   Ingenious indeed.   I must pay more attentionto their vibrations.   Those weren't footsteps.   It seems he threwring-like objects.   And these burns...   It must have been Avdol.   But he'll be a problem no longer.   Good bye...   -It's back!-It's back!   Avdol!   Hmm... someone is running now.   I don't believe it!Jotaro's running?   His stride tells mehe is about    ...   No,     centimeters tall.   He has a youthfulness to him.He's not Joseph.   It must be Jotaro.   But where is he running?   It dove in!   The water's after Jotaro!   So it's come to this.   It stopped attacking Avdol, but...   Jotaro! He's catching up!   I hear of all our enemies' Stands,   Jotaro's Star Platinum isby far the fiercest.   Master Dio will be delightedif I m*rder him.   With every fiber of my being,for Master Dio,   I shall defeat Jotaro!   Jotaro just picked something upoff the sand.   What was at that location?   What was it...   No, it's not inanimate!   It's the dog!Jotaro grabbed the dog.   He knows!   So that's your game.   You jumped out of the carbefore it was att*cked!   You can smell it! You know wherethe Stand's coming from!   Don't stop, Jotaro!   Time to earn your keep, Iggy.   Where's it coming from?Spill it, Iggy!   Or else we die together.   You won't get any gumfrom me, either.   Iggy!   He can fly?   Not so fast!   Go ahead, pant all you want.You're not getting out of this one.   My Star Platinum is fast.   You let me go,and I'll snap your neck.   What? He jumped and then nothing.   They haven't landed anywhere.   Impossible...   That's brilliant!   Jotaro's using Iggyto find the Stand user!   If we can find whoever'scontrolling the Stand,   we might actually havea chance of defeating him!   He's gone...   I can't hear Jotaro's footsteps.   Where is he? Where did he go?   Why can't I hear his footsteps?   They're flying lower and lower...   Looks like The Fool can't flylong distances.   It's gliding like a paper airplane!   My legs are about totouch the ground.   Hey, quit tensing up like that.   You're farting again.   You'd better notlet loose a big one.   I guess I have no choice.   Time to get a little more air.   That brought us a lot closer,   but the sound of that kickjust sent us back some.   Now he'll know we're flying.   So that's it! The dog's Stand...   can fly.   And they're...   heading this way!    I must k*ll Jotaro beforehe gets any closer!    His Stand is going after Jotaro!    He figured it out whenJotaro struck the ground!    All we can do now is trust Jotaro.    He's getting closer.    Sure, he was able tobring down a copter,    but he won't findour exact location.    Iggy's Stand makes barely a sound.    If I can just find the Stand userbefore touching the sand,    it'll be lights out for good!    Found him!    The Stand user's about    meters away!    Seems our enemy is blind.    It's sand!Sand's falling from the sky!    That's why he's hurling sandinto the air!    Not good!    He's locating us by listening tothe sand bounce off the wings.    Just like a submarine uses sonar!    I can hear you... I can hearthe sand bouncing off you.    I've found your coordinates.I know your altitude...    Jotaro!    GEBN'DOUL    sh**t him!    Star Platinum!    Star Platinum's speedmeans nothing.    If you can't determinemy direction of att*ck,    my Stand has the advantage!    Here comes another!    Iggy...    You damn dog...    That dog is dragging Jotaroright into my Stand's grasp!    It'll do anythingto save his own hide.    Even abandon his master!    Bastard...    -You little piece of...-Iggy...    That's what you get for relying onsuch a fickle creature, Jotaro.    The end has finally come.    Now, to put an end to your misery...    What? He's thrown something at me!    This wind shear...    What was it?    It's Iggy.    Come on, now.    You'd better use your Standsto defend yourselves,    or you'll both end up one big mess.    Such incredible velocity...    Damn! It's going to crash into me!    I can't believe it!He threw the dog...    Blast it! I was so closeto finishing Jotaro...    No!    I lost Jotaro's locationbecause of that damn dog!    Where is he?    He's not moving...    He's staying absolutely still.    This must be part of his plan!    Where are you, Jotaro?    Where? Show yourself, Jotaro.    Right here.    I see...    I didn't realizeyou had slinked so close.    If I hadn't protected myselfwith this water shield,    you would have alreadystruck me from behind.    I suppose I no longer needthis cane to hear you.    But I'll need itwhen I return home.    Iggy...    You knocked off my hat.    You know, I kept that hat oneven when I was scuba diving.    Don't worry. I went easy on you.    You'll live.    What? You used your own Stand to...    Why did you do it?    You thought you couldget me to talk...    tell you about the othereight Stand users, didn't you?    I know Joseph Joestar'sHermit Purple    can read people's minds.    I'll never tell you anything...    anything that you coulduse against him.    Dio...    Why are you all so loyal to him?    So loyal that you'd die...    Jotaro, I do not fear death.    My Stand has always enabled me    to live life unfetteredby a fear of death.    I could win any fight.    I could have and do whateverI wanted. No one could stop me.    k*lling, stealing...it meant nothing to me.    I'm sure that muttknows how I feel.    He was the first and only person    to instill in me a desire to live.    He was so strong, so wise,so beautiful.    He was the only one who sawa purpose to my existence.    I waited so long to meet him.    I will gladly die, but...    I will not disappoint him.    Evil needs an evil savior.    I'll tell you just one thing.    My name is N'doul.    My Stand hails from Egypt,birthplace of the Tarot.    One of the great Ennead,the nine gods of Egypt...    It is called Geb, god of Earth.    The nine Egyptian gods?    What do you mean?    I will tell you aboutmy Stand only...    After all, you are the onewho defeated me.    The rest stays with me...    Dio is like some charismaticcult leader...    Just who is he?    And the nine gods of Egypt?    It's all a mystery.    But we have to continue onward.    Hey, no need to be defensive.I'm not mad or anything.    I doubt you wanted to be    dragged out into the desertand forced into some human fight.    Guess I don't blame youfor being pissed.    Here, Iggy. Want some gum?    Calm down. I said I'm sorry.    Here.    Good grief.That dog's a pain in the ass.    Stay out here in the middle ofthe desert for all I care.    Iggy...    Well, what do you know.You picked up my hat for me?    Maybe you're not so bad.    Thanks.    Gum. Damn mutt...    You're no ordinary pooch.    Hey!    Jotaro!    Jotaro! Are you all right?    Good grief.    Oh? Is that a comic book?    Never seen one here before!    So Egyptians read comics, too?    Want some mini-donuts?     TASTY DONUTS    Hey... Um, can I see that?    I'm a comic book artist searchingfor inspiration.    I love rare books and comics.    Here, I'll let you usemy binoculars.    What's this? "Zenyatta MondattaBrothers Adventure."    I don't see the author's nameanywhere...    Wow.    Such weird pictures.    Great print quality,and in full color!    There once lived two brotherswho got along very well.    "My name is Zenyatta."    "My name is Mondatta."    Mondatta, the younger brother,was very shy    and wouldn't do anythingwithout Zenyatta.    He was always alone.    One day, while his big brother,Zenyatta, was away,    Mondatta met a very kind traveler.    The traveler gave Mondattayummy snacks,    and let Mondattalook through his binoculars.    Mondatta had so much fun.    "Oh, it's   :  !"    But the very kind traveler...    was impaled on a telephone poleand d*ed.    What a weird comic.    Is this comic popular here?    This book is so weird.    The rest of the pagesare all blank.    Nothing's printed...    Must be defective.    Somehow this comic hastotally pulled me in.    I know this sounds crazy,but could I buy this book from you?    -It's not for sale.-Huh?    My brother's book isn't for sale!    Now get lost.    Brother?    Didn't you hear me?    I told you not totalk to strangers.    There are lots of bad peopleout there, ya know.    Last call! The bus for Aswanis about to depart!    Let's go.    I heard they're heading    to the hospital in Aswanto drop off their friend.    I see...    I guess we can't domuch about that.    Then we'll have to waitfor the next bus.    We are unstoppable brothers!    Who's there?    It's me, Polnareff.    Jotaro, what happenedto your uniform?    You're acting weird today.    Could it possibly be that you're...    -Could it be...-Could it be...    Zenyatta, the predictionsare absolute.    Do your best!
02x27 - Khnum's Oingo and Thoth's Boingo / Khnum's Zenyatta and Thoth's MondattaQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:43Ah, new pages...  they came.  The brothers Zenyatta and Mondattatook a bus four hours later...  So they managed to avoid gettinginto an accident. Yippee!  What adventures await them now?  Once in Aswan,they made their discovery:  "Oh! There they are!"  "The five bad guys!",cried the brothers.  But the brothers wondered,"What are they talking about?"   The bad guys seemed so worried...   It's them.   Little did they know. They haddrunk tea laced with poison. Gulp!   Zenyatta...    So all I have to do is poison them.   Mondatta, you and Iare invincible together.   With your clairvoyant comic Stand...   and my face Stand...   my transformative ability...   They're as good as dead!    Our cards are Thoth,God of Writing,   and Khnum, God of Creation!   We're the ZenyattaMondatta brothers!    EPISODE   KHNUM'S ZENYATTA AND THOTH'S MONDATTA   In this cafÃ©,   at that table... This is wherethey'll drink their poison tea.   My Stand, Thoth,the God of Writing, never lies.   So, how are they?   Luckily, Avdol's major arteriesweren't damaged,   so he'll probably bereleased tomorrow.   But Kakyoin's injuries are serious.   He could go blind.   I'm worried about him.   I hate to say it, but we might haveto leave him behind.   Hey, look at all these cafÃ©s.   We could all use a break.Let's get a drink.   Sounds good. Which one?   My cigarette says that one.   Welcome.   What would you like?   Let's see... How bout some tea.   Same.   Yes, sir.Three teas, coming right up.   No, scratch that.   -Huh?-Listen. We're in enemy territory.   This is Dio's dominion.   Who knows whenour enemies will att*ck.   We have to be more cautious.Someone could easily poison us.   From now on, we drink onlyfrom bottles and cans.   What? Are you serious?   I am serious.   Hey, forget the tea.We'll take coke instead.   Coke?   Yeah. Something wrong?   No. Okay. Coke, right?   Okay, three bottles of coke then.   Oh, and we'll open them ourselves.   Give me the third, fourth,and fifth ones from the right.   Now they want Coke?   How am I supposed to put poisonin an unopened coke...   Was the prediction wrong?   No, my brother's comicis always right.   I have to believe!I have to believe Mondatta!   If I can't stand behindhis predictions,   we won't have a chance!   Brother, my predictionsare foolproof!   Hey, you! This Coke's warm!   Is this your idea of a cold drink?I'm not paying for this, idiot!   Hey, the Coke's not cold?   The fridge is down so...   You're being paranoid.   Even if that guy was our enemy,   and even if he was tryingto poison us...   how would he have knownwe'd come to this cafe?   This city has tons of cafÃ©s,and I chose this one on a whim.   I could understandif this was the only cafÃ©,   but there are tons of them.   My point iswe can't be too careful.   If you're that worried,let's go somewhere else then.   Let's go to the oneacross the street.   All right.   -Fire!-Huh?   My cafÃ© is on fire!   Some fool left a burning cigarettein the road.   It ignited the trash!   Hey, sir.We'll take three teas after all.   We won...   But...   What kind of jerk would tossa lit cigarette near the trash...   They're drinking it!   Drink it all...   -They drank it!-They drank it!   A dog took my cake!   Who the hell broughta dog in here?   -Iggy...-Iggy...   Whose dog is this?   Hey! Get that dog outta here!   Damn it, Iggy!   Get back here, you!   Damn it! They were just aboutto swallow the poison!    sh*t! What's supposed tohappen next?    It hasn't come yet...    But the comic wasn't wrong.    Thoth sees the near future.    Next time we'll get them...    We'll k*ll them withthe next premonition!    That's right. We're...    the Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!    "That darn dog! We failed!"    "We were so close!",fumed the brothers.    Zenyatta and Mondattawere very mad.    But they didn't give up.    Zenyatta and Mondatta followedthe three guys and their dog.    While following them,    they met a man who had a facethat really made them angry.    It was exactly the kind of facethe brothers hated.    Something must havehappened to me in a past life    to hate guys like this...    It really pisses me off.He deserves a knuckle sandwich!    He was a perfectly nice man,but Zenyatta punched him anyway!    The man with the bad face ran away...    and left a wallet full of money.    "Yay! We're rich!    We're so lucky! Whoopee!"cried Mondatta.    What a fool.    We're rich!    Ah! Brother, another page.    The brothers continuedtheir pursuit.    The bad guys got in their carand headed to the hospital    to see their friendsAvdol and Kakyoin.    Zenyatta made a b*mbout of an orange    and planted it in the car.    Jotaro was blown to bits!    His head was split in two,and blood splattered everywhere!    Look how clearthe comic came in...    Yes!    KHNUMZENYATTA    My Stand, Thoth,can see only the near future.    But once the prediction's printed,it can't be changed! Ever!    Jotaro will blow up!    The b*mb will detonatethree seconds    after he sticks his finger into peel it.    It's destiny!    There's no way out!    -Who's there?-Wha--    Who's in our car?    It's not Jotaro?    No. Jotaro said he was goingstraight to the hospital.    -Be careful!-Crap...    Don't let him get away!    Crap! It's Joestar and Polnareff!    Hey, stop hiding in there!    Who are you? Come out.    I said come out, damn it!    Hurry it up!    Hey, what's the matter guys?    It's me, can't you tell?    Oh, it's you, Jotaro.    My Stand, Khnum,is a transforming Stand.    I can alter my height, weight,and scent to whatever I want.    I used my hairto recreate this hat!    But what happened?    You said you were goingstraight to the hospital.    Huh? Um, uh... Right, the hospital.    I forgot something, so I came back.    My wallet.I left my wallet in the car.    Good grief.    Jotaro, what happened toyour school uniform?    School uniform?    What? School uniform?    That's really nota good look on you.    Oh, my outfit.I mean my school uniform...    It's at the dry cleaners!    I took it to the cleaners,and didn't have any money.    That'll convince them. Yeah!    Huh. I see...    Then get in the car. Let's go.    Huh?    Huh? The car?    It can't be...    It can't be!    If I get into the carwith this face,    that means the real Jotarowon't get blown up! It'll be Me!    Impossible!    Nah, actually,I think I'm going to walk...    There isn't time, Jotaro!    It'll be fasterif you just get in the car.    Zenyatta!    Crap...    I've got to undomy Jotaro disguise,    or I'll be the onewho gets blown up!    That's it! I just need tothrow it away!    I'll get rid of this one    and put it back in the car later,    so it can blow up the real Jotaro!    I did it!    There! Now I'm safe!    Hey, it's Iggy!He's chasing our car.    He's got an orange in his mouth!Did you steal that, Iggy?    That'll make a nice giftfor Kakyoin and Avdol.    Wha-- Yow!    -"Yow"?-"Yow"?    I never thought I'd hear you saysomething like that.    You're acting strange.    No... Yow. You know, yow.    I was saying there wasa cyow over there...    Jotaro... You are actingpeculiar today.    Where's your usual cool self?    You're not actually...    a fake, are you?    Good grief. What the hell are youtalking about, Polnareff?    Are we at the hospital yet?    Hey, Jotaro.Show me that trick again.    That... trick?    What is he talking about?    The one you taught me.    You know, this!    Hey, you've gotten better.    Oh, that! You mean that trick.    Thank goodness!    I know how to do that!It's risky, but I can pull it off!    Sure! It's easy.    All right! Do the onewith five cigarettes!    Five?    Come on! Hurry up.I wanna see it again.    Crap! Damn that Jotaroand his stupid party tricks!    If I don't do it...    they'll really thinksomething is up.    They're already suspicious of me.    And Polnareff is about toset off the b*mb!    Fine! Dammit!    I'll do it!    Fine. I'll do five.    Come on, now do it!    I'm gonna do it!Fine, I'll do it, dammit!    Here I go! This is nothing!    Ow, hot!    Hot...    I did it! Hot damn, I did it!    There! Did you see that? I did it!    A man can do anything whenhis life is on the line!    Here.    Last time you drank juice withoutputting the cigarettes out.    Come on.    Aw, you blew it!    Jotaro, are you all right?Oh my God!    Brother! Mondatta!    Make that predictiongo away right now!    Tear up that page!    Zenyatta! The predictioncan't be changed!    Hurry up and go backto your regular self!    Undo the disguise andthe real Jotaro will blow up!    You can do it!    Jotaro, you're actingreally weird today.    I just... feel a bitunder the weather...    Crap!    I know their type.They're going to interrogate me    and realize I'm an imposter!    If they figure me out,they'll k*ll me.    And if I don't undo my disguise,    I'll blow up just likethe prophecy said!    That's it! I'll just pretend I'm sick.    I'll make them let me out ofthe car to relieve myself!    Jotaro, the way you'reclasping your hands...    You've got your left thumb on top!    Dammit!    Does Jotaro always clasp his handswith his right thumb on top?    What kind of person notices that?    What am I going to do?    That just proves you were a womanin your past life!    Since I put my right thumb on top,    I was a man in my past life!    Wow, really? I always putmy left thumb on top.    Sorry, Mr. Joestar.    Then that proves you toowere once a woman.    What do you mean, "proves"?    What do thumbs have to do with it?    That's so stupid!    Now I really feel sick...    They're driving me nuts!    All right. I'll tell themI've got a stomach ache...    Jotaro, let's see who can eatan orange the fastest!    What?    Hey...    No! Don't, idiot!    Whoa! What are you doing, Jotaro?    What's the matter, Jotaro?    Oh, it's nothing.    You really are acting weird.    Not that orange. Not that one.    Huh? Why?    Well, you know... Iggy found it.    He could've found it in the gutter.    Eat this one instead.    It's not dirty or bruised.It's fine.    Fine, I'll eat this one.You can use one of those.    -It hurts!-Huh?    -Hey.-My stomach hurts!    I have to go to the bathroom!My stomach hurts!    Stop! Hurry!    Oh, your stomach hurts?    I can't hold it anymore!Let me out!    I'll go behind that rock!    But the hospital's right there...    Just go ahead without me.    I mean it,I'll just catch up later!    Not so fast, Jotaro!    Here, toilet paper.    I...    I did it! I made it!    I got out of that car! I'm safe!    I'll go behind that rock andundo my disguise!    Who knows whereIggy picked up this orange.    Maybe it was lying in the gutter.    Do you want it?    No. Toss it.    Yes! Now I can use Khnum's powersto change back to normal.    And then we win!    The Zenyatta Mondatta brothers win!    We win!    Ah?    Oh, no!    Huh? What was that?    Who cares? Probably constructionor something.    Zenyatta...    Speak to me!    We lost, Mondatta.    No...    No! My Stand, Thoth,hasn't lost yet.    I'll k*ll them myself!    Mondatta...    Don't, Mondatta.    They're no ordinary guys.It's impossible.    I'm gonna do it!I've made up my mind!    I'll do it on my own!    I can do it!    You were always so shy...You've grown up, Mondatta.    I'll k*ll them all!    What does the book of Thothsay next?    That's them...    They're the ones who punched meand stole my wallet!    All right, guys!b*at them to a bloody pulp,    and I'll make sureyou're richly rewarded!    It's that guy!    Brother! I'm really scared!    Despite his burst of bravery,    Mondatta would have to waitto avenge his brother.    But don't give up, Mondatta!    Life has its ups and downs.    Huh?    Well, if it isn't Jotaro.    Hey. Took you long enough.    We took too long?    How'd you poop behindthat rock so fast?    I can't believeyou got here before us...    You even went to the dry cleaners?    What the hell are you two...    Hey, an ambulance.    Looks like someone's hurt.    That's too bad...    Oranges, huh?I was just getting thirsty.    I'll take one.    Oh?    That man's clothes...    Do you know him?    No, of course not.    Come on. Let's go find out howAvdol and Kakyoin are doing.    And so the brotherseventually gave up.    The battle was over,    and Jotaro and the otherswere none the wiser.    Ba-dum-tss.    Hey, look!It's a sword.    He's holding a sword.    It won't come out...It won't even budge.    I want to cut you down now, too.    Use me, and k*ll them.    Come at me with your Anubis Stand.
02x28 - Anubis, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:43Any improvement withyour injuries, Avdol?  Yes. But I am relieved to knowyou will be all right, Kakyoin.  Well I...  Luckily my cornea wasn't damaged,  so they expect meto make a full recovery.  I remember whenI was in middle school,  and my classmate wasstruck by a baseball  directly in the eye.  It turned out he wasfine the next day.   The eye only lost a bit of fluid.   Are you serious?   No!   The bandages will come offin a few days.   I'll catch up with you later.   It's less than     kilometersto Cairo... and Dio.   Everyone, you must be vigilant.   Hmm, what language isthis hospital bill in...   Arabic?   Man, it's so confusing!   The   is supposed to be five...The decimal is zero, and seven is a six?   And this wormy-looking one is...   A four. So, the amount we owe is...    Forty-six thousand three hundred fiftyEgyptian pounds?    That's insane!    He's adorable!   What is he I wonder?   He's so funny looking!   What in the world?He's chewing gum.   He must be waiting for someone.   Such a good little doggy!   And here I thoughthe was waiting outside.   Good grief.   So he's a hit with ladies, is he?   I wonder why he's chewing gum.   What a weird little puppy.   Um, hello?   Let me give you some advice.You'd best step away from that dog.   He may seem charming,   but he basically hates people.   If you're not careful,he'll make your--   Damn mutt!Get off of m--   -You stinking...-Ew! He tooted!   He's so cute!   You get along so well.   We don't get along at all!   Damn it, Iggy! Get off of me!   Catch you later, lovebirds.   Mr. Joestar?   Hey, hang on!   You...   You nasty little mutt!    In ancient Egypt,the dead were always buried    on the west bank of the Nile,where the sun sets.   That's why all Egyptian citiesstand on the east side of the Nile.   On the west, you'll findgraves and mortuary temples.   But our enemiesdon't care about east or west.   They'll come from all directions.   Your cows are far too lazy.   They're strong, though,I'll give them that...   Chaka! Get a move on!   Stop falling behind!   Damn it!   What kind of man are you?Are you really my son?   Your cows and your sonare just like you!   A sword?   What's it doing here?   Hey, look! It's a sword!   Give me that!   What? Someone must've dropped it.   Amazing someone left it!   This is incredible!It must be worth a fortune!   Hey, maybe the owner'sstill around.   He must've been in a major panic.   You don't think, it mightbe some kind of artifact?   Are you going toturn it in to the police?   Idiot! This could fetch usloads of money!   But I found it...   But if it's blunt,it won't be worth anything.   Come on! Pull it out.   Right!   What's wrong?   It won't come out!It won't budge!   Give it to me.   Here.   Hold that end.   Right.   It's no use.   The blade hasn't movedone centimeter!   Let me have a try.   Shut up!   How are you going to do it,if I can't, idiot!   My hand!   My hand! This gaping wound!   How? How did it cut me?   The blade wouldn't even come out!   The only thing I grabbedwas the hilt!   There's something strangeabout that sword...   Um... How about if I try now?   Fine! Go aheadand try already then!    It just came out.    But I didn't putany effort into it.    What...    I can hear the blade ringing...    I don't know much about swords,    but I've never seen a bladethis beautiful.    It's like a Japanese katana!    It glistens, like it's cloakedin ice-cold water...    What an amazing find!    Hey! Give it to me!You shouldn't be holding it!    Hand it over!    Hey, wha...    Why did you do it?    I don't know...    You were standingbehind me, Father.    It's not my fault...    What are you doing?Hurry!    We have to take him to a doctor!    This sword is evil!    It's like it has a mind of its own!    Be calm.    Let your heart grow still, Chaka.    Their deaths mean nothing.    Who are you?    I can't see you,but I hear your voice...    I am the Stand of the God Anubis.    Ruler of the underworld...    Deity of embalming,Lord of the dead...    You have unsheathed me.You shall be my Stand user...    You are my flesh!    You are a virtuoso.    I shall make you masterof the sword.    No one is stronger than you.    Wield me, and k*ll!    Father and that manboth deserved to die.    I think I'll hack youto pieces, too.    What?Hey, Chaka, stop!    Please stop!    Impossible!    The cow's unharmed...    Slaughter Joseph!Slice Polnareff!    Cleave Jotaro in two!    You are a fighting genius!A master of the sword!    No one is stronger than you!    The world is no matchfor your blade!    Kom Ombo?    Do we really have timefor this place?    Quit moaning.    They've allowed us passageon their ferry.    We must show our respect.    Come on, I'm starving!Let's get something to eat.    You never stop, do you? Here.This'll tide you over for now.    That's Iggy's!    Don't worry about it.Just take it.    By the way,where can I find a bathroom?    Shall we investigate?    Hey, mister, over here.    Want to buy some papyrus?    Papyrus is the original paper!Want a piece of Egyptian history?    Look, look! It's real papyrus!    Papyrus?    I'll give you a good price.    It's the real thing?    Of course, my friend.    A famous Egyptian craftsmandrew this.    Hm...    It's a fake. Real papyruswould never rip so easily.    You can't fool me.    Huh?    Where is Mr. Joestarand the others?    Huh?    Iggy? Why, you little...Hold it!    Hey! Where's my money?    That stupid dogjust gave me the slip...    Hey.    That's a pretty ballsy move...    Preparing to att*ck mewith so many people around.    Guys like you are rare.    Stand users don't usuallyshow themselves,    let alone facetheir attacker head-on.    It's quite noble, really.    I didn't think any of youwere like that.    Tell me your name.    I am Chaka.    My Stand is Anubis,Ruler of the Underworld.    Jean Pierre Polnareff,your life is mine.    My life is yours?    You certainly don't mince your words.    Your boldness is impressive,I must say.    Bring it on!    Let's see what your so-calledAnubis Stand is made of!    Chariot!    He's holding a sword, but...    Is he really going to fight me withthat instead of his Stand?    Something's strange.    His movements...That grip...that stance...    They're the hallmark of an amateur!Something's strange.    I need to be careful.    I need to keep my distance.    ANUBISCHAKA    What the hell?    The sword passedthrough the pillar.    And my shirt too!    He cut me withoutcutting my shirt!    I would've been k*lledif I hadn't stepped back.    You bastard! Chariot!    Stop hiding, and show... yourself!    Crap...    How could I? I lost him.    He could be hiding behindany one of these pillars.    His sword can pass through solid objects.    And my Chariot's striking rangeis only about one meter...    Damn!He's tougher than I thought.    I can't believethis jerk is giving me a run for my money    in sword fighting.    But you won't havethe advantage for long!    All right, Chaka, old pal!    Try and att*ck me now!    You can't sneak up on meif I'm not behind a pillar!    You're not gonna pop up outof the ground, are you?    What?    The pillar...    My sword need not passthrough objects!    I can cut throughthe pillar itself!    Die, Polnareff!    That was close.    Even Jotaro doesn't knowabout that technique.    Silver Chariotcan launch its rapier.    I have one chance only.    If the opponent dodges,I'm done for.    I use it only as a last resort.    No, I didn't k*ll you,    but I don't thinkyou'll be fighting again.    That's strange...    The sword's back in its scabbard.    Did it just slip back in by chance?    Now that I see this sword up close,    I see its beauty.    I must unsheathe it...    Hey, Polnareff. There you are.    You worried us,going off like that by yourself.    We thought you'd been ambushed.    Polnareff?    Huh? Oh.It's you, Mr. Joestar.    My mind's so fuzzy...    Maybe it's frombeing tossed around,    or maybe it's fromall these wounds.    Polnareff, why are you squatting?    You step in some poop?    Wait? Where'd you find that sword?Did something happen?    Yeah...I was just fighting that jerk.    What? An enemy Stand user?    It's over now.    He said his Standwas the god Anubis.    It was a Stand that couldphase through objects and cut them.    He was a powerful opponent.    "But, of course,he was no match for me."    Polnareff reassured himself.    He att*cked me with this swor--    Huh?    It's gone?    Rats are runningoff with the sword!    Hey!    Talk about creepy...    So rats steal stuff here?    If you want to steal,go steal some damn cheese!    That's odd...    Now the sword's stuckin the scabbard.    Polnareff!    I'm glad you're all right,    but don't ever run offby yourself again.    It's too dangerous!    They'll att*ck if you'realone for even a few seconds.    Oh, no! That's our ship!    Let's hurry.We need to get to Edfu today.    Wait. Hey!    Polnareff...    So you brought the sword?    I'm turning it in to the police.It is a dangerous w*apon.    Good, we can't take any chances.    Who knows who mightpick it up at those ruins.    Besides, it's likely to beextremely valuable.    Hey, Iggy! Quiet!    We could get kicked out of here!    What the hell is with you today?    Well, since this damn dogwon't shut up,    I think I'll take thisto the cops now.    Polnareff! I thought we told younot to go off on your own!    I just told you!Jotaro, go with him.    Right.    Hey.Shouldn't we get to the police station?    Oh, come on!    A man's got to lookhis best, right?    Oh, right.    Excuse me, would you putthis sword over there?    Certainly.    That thing's a dangerous w*apon.    Anyway, I was rolling around a bitand got kinda dirty.    Make this handsome face gorgeousagain will you, Mr. Barber?    Certainly.    Ow...    Hey, watch it!That razor's dull.    Sharpen that thing!    This is supposed to bethe most relaxing part!    Good grief.What a prima donna.    That so? My apologies.    Good!    Much better.Now that's a shave.    So very... glad to hear, sir.    TrÃ¨s bien!    Now under my chin, too.    Certainly.    Right here...    under your chin, yes?    Under the chin!Right, Polnareff?    What?    It's me, you fool.The Anubis Stand!    Grr!    The sword itself is a Stand!    I won't lose to someoneI've faced before!    He's strong...    The more I fight him,the faster his att*cks become.    The look in Polnareff's eyes...    I'll have...    your head!
02x29 - Anubis, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:44Under the chin, right, Polnareff?  What?  It's me, you fool.The Anubis Stand!  Now what?  Die!  I'll shave your jaw clean off!  Who the hell are you?  And what've you donewith the barber?  Could that sword possibly beâ¦   Could it be the Stand?   Is it controlling the barber?   So the guy at Kom Ombowasn't the Stand user!   Polnareffâ¦   Either way,I'm still stronger than you!   He's so strongâ¦   I learned Chariot's movesand powers during our last battle!   I won't lose twiceto the same opponent!   Come on.    Come on, you've almost got it.    EPISODE   : ANUBIS, PART     Oh?   Polnareff and Jotaroseem to be taking a while.   Polnareff, what'sâ¦   Is this barber aâ¦   Stay back, Jotaro!   This sword is the Stand.   It's too dangerous to useStar Platinum's bare fists   against this blade.   The barber isn't the Stand user!He's just a puppet.   Not to mention,   this Stand's even stronger now!   You bastard!   Whoa, there.   Too much to handle?   Now I know the limitsof your defense.   Let's see if you can survivemy next att*ck, Polnareff!   Polnareff!   He's getting strongerâ¦with every strike!   I can't keep parrying.   He's going to get me!   Now!   Take this!   What?   I know all your moves now.   It doesn't matterwho my wielder is.   If I fought you onceâ¦   I neverâ¦   ever lose twice!   It's no use.Without my rapier I'm deadâ¦   sh*t! Help, Jotaro!   Star Platinum!   Think he's through?   No, that was a shallow punch.   And it took just abouteverything I had.   -Hey, Khan. Are you all right? Heyâ¦-sh*t. This guy's strong.   We haven't seenone like this in a while.   A stand that doesn'trely on gimmicksâ¦   Just pure power.   Not bad, Star Platinum.   So the rumors are true.You're swift.   But now that I've seen it,I can b*at it.   What's wrong, Khan?   Stay back!   He's being controlled!   If you want to remain in one piece,get back in and hide!   We're in major trouble, Jotaro.   The more we fight,the faster it gets.   Its next att*ck will beits fastest,   and strongest yet!   Move, Polnareff.   It's me he's after!   Run, Jotaro!   Die!   He caught it withhis bare hands?   To take that risk isâ¦   Now I know.   The true source ofStar Platinum's strength   isn't its speed and precision.   It's Jotaro's split-seconddecision-making ability   and nerves of steel.   Now I knowâ¦   Is he dead?   No, he's just unconscious.   Jotaro, don't touch that sword!   You snapped it in half,   but the Stand's powersmight still be lingering.   Unsheathed, the sword controlsanyone who touches it.   Let's get the blade back inwithout touching the hilt.   Now what?   If someone ever draws it out again,we're done for.   This thing's alreadylearned our abilities.   We won't get any second chances.   How about tossingthe freaking thing into the river   to live at the bottom of the Nile?   The bottom of the Nile, huh?Sound's good to me!   Hold it! Police!   Perfect timing.This guy needs a hospitalâ¦   I have reports of a brawlat the barber shop!   What are you doingwith that sword?    Hand it over!    Hey, stop!    Don't pull it out!    Polnareff!    No!    His eyesâ¦ that stareâ¦    He's under the sword's spell.    Hey! You drew the sword!    I drew the sword?    Officer, you should reallybe more careful.    And you call yourselfa servant of the law?    Hey, what are you doing?    You're the one who drew it!    I don't know who you areor where you're hiding,    but it's clear Polnareff'sunder your control.    I've never foughtagainst Polnareff.    And with Chariot I won't be ableto pull any punches.    I could end up k*lling him.    Don't forget that I, Anubis,    have already witnessedall of Star Platinum's moves.    If I've fought you once,    I never lose twice!    Hey, now.    His speedâ¦ it's incredible!    He's getting faster.Soon he'll outpace me!    I have to stop his sword!    I've got to catch the blade again!    It sped up!    I'll take your head!    Wha...    Such speed and power.    It's the fastest StandI've ever faced.    At this rate I'll lose.    I have to fight Polnarefffull force, or I'm dead.    So you head butted the sword away    after you realizedyou'd failed to catch my bladeâ¦    I almost had you.    I was so close.    Butâ¦    I've learned that skill now, too.    Jotaro.    You think you can k*ll Polnareffand live, don't you?    Such wishful thinking. How naive!    Becauseâ¦ what I'm about to show youwill end all of this!    Can youâ¦    b*at this, Jotaro?    Behold the Silver Chariotand Anubisâ¦    two-sword technique!    ANUBISKHAN    Dammitâ¦    This extra sword,his accelerating speedâ¦    Even my Star Platinumâ¦    What's the matter?A bit winded, Jotaro?    I'll stop him before he kills me!    Star Finger!    My right arm is as lightas a feather now.    Interesting.I guess that was one optionâ¦    You look surprised.    Round two! Armor release!    You fool!Your "ora ora" is no match    for two swords wieldedby two master swordsmen!    Your stomach is wide open!    I've got you now!    I did it! I win!    Master Dio!I've exterminated Jotaro!    I, the god Anubis, have k*lled him!    Victory!    Don't think you'll be able to stopthe blade or pull it out.    I've already surpassedStar Platinum.    Now for the final thrustâ¦    The final thrust?    Precisely!    I'll slice open your bowels!And Master Dio will rejoice!    Stop.    Don't drive the blade inany furtherâ¦    It'll be m*rder.    No mercy!    I'll spill your gutsonto the pavement!    What?    You're breaking me!I have to pull free!    Stop!    Weren't you saying somethingabout slicing me open?    I told you it'd be m*rderif you drove that blade in any furtherâ¦    your m*rder, that is.    You're an easy targetwhen the sword is still.    What a painâ¦    This last att*cktook everything I had.    Luckily it was enough to defeat him    before he could learn itlike all the rest.    I've never been so exhausted.    I have to find Avdoland the old man, fast.    What just happened?    The sword didn't possess me,did it?    Yeahâ¦ But it's over.    Forgive meâ¦    Polnareff, get the old manand Avdol.    I can't walk. I'm too tired.    Wow, it's shinyâ¦    Now I've learned that trick, tooâ¦    My Stand user was the swordsmithwho forged me     years ago.    He perished long ago,but I survive.    I am a Stand with no master.    Master Dio found me and saved mefrom the shadows of the museum.    Master Dio's Stand, The World,is far more powerful than me.    That's why I pledged my loyalty.    Jotaro,    I swear, I'll m*rder you!    I know your strength.    Your speedâ¦    You'll never see it coming!    I'll s*ab you in the back!    Die, Jotaro!    What?    No!

If I wedge into those planks,    that guy's curiositywill make him pull me out.    Then, I'll take over his mind!    I'll use his bodyto take revenge on Jotaro!    Ack! A cow's on board?    Wait! Calm down! Hey!    Cool it, you stupid cow!    I know!I'll take over the cow's mind!    And thenâ¦    I won't make it in time!    Hey, look.That cow is going berserk!    Good grief.Who cares about a damn cow?    Just go get the old man and Avdol.    Help me!    Hey, fishies. Come here.    Come on, swim to me.    Hey, wait! Where are you going?    Hey, Mr. Crab.    Do me a favor and take me ashore.    I'll give you something yummy.    Wait! Don't leave me, Mr. Crab!    I'll be rusted throughin a couple of days!    Help me!    Don't leave me!

02x30 - Bastet's Mariah, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:44Good morning!  How are we feeling today,Mr. Kakyoin?  Well, this new way of lifehas certainly set me on edge.  Any further discomfort?  No.The painkillers must be working.  Good. That's excellent news.  Morning, Kakyoin.  Doctor, these bandages...  How much longerdo I have to keep them on?   I don't have much time.   Kakyoin, you will recover,   but this is nothingto take lightly.   You will need to remain in our carefor a little while longer.   For how long, well, I'm afraid,I'm unable to say.   Oh I'm kidding!   You need time to heal.   But, well, for some reason,   the Speedwagon Foundation doctorsrecently contacted us.   They've asked that we entrustyour care to them.   Though I'm sure their state-of-the-artmedical treatments   will prove effective.   Who exactly are you, anyway?   The Speedwagon Foundationis world-famous.   I can't imagine they'd wantanything to do   with an ordinaryhigh school student.   Let's just say I havea very dependable friend.   Thank you, Mr. Joestar.   I guess it won't be longbefore I see you after all.   Jotaro, Polnareff, Avdol, Iggy...   Hang in there.    EPISODE   : BAST'S MARIAH, PART     Located along the Nilein Southern Egypt   is the city of Luxor.   To the ancient Egyptians,it was the site of Thebes.   And it is here,on the west bank of the Nile,   where the pharaohswere once laid to rest.   Today we call this sacred sitethe Valley of the Kings.   The tomb of the greatTutankhamun lies here,   in the Valley of the Kings.   Wow, this place is full of history.   Apparently,some residents of this area   still dig beneath their houses   in search of treasure withoutpermission from the government.   You think there areany undiscovered   tombs or treasure left?   Perhaps.   Hey, where'd the old man go?   To the bathroom.   He's with Iggy, so the dog willalert him to anything unusual.   Bathroom?   Do you need to go?   If it's a normal bathroom.   It's so arid here,   the crap dries upand turns to dust...   Instead of water,this toilet uses wind?   And there's no toilet paper.   Wait, is this...   some kind of sand bidet?   You wipe your ass... with sand?   Desert sand is sterile.   I think I'll pull a Polnareff   and wait untilwe get back to the hotel.   What's the point of this shack?Might as well go behind a rock.   This is weird even for Egypt.   This makes no sense.   Why is there an electrical outletin the rock?   I wonder what it's for?   There's no electricity here...   It shocked me...   Mr. Joestar, are you all right?   It's time to leave.   Huh? Right...   Got it. I'll be right there.   That scared the living daylightsout of me...   I can't believe it was live.   I guess the cables rununderground?   God only knows.   This place is surreal...   Card of the Goddess BastStand User: Mariah   You know what they say...Curiosity k*lled the cat.   We could make it to Cairoin two days,   but we're all injuredand exhausted.   Why don't we take tonightand tomorrow in Luxor   to recover somewhat?   Sounds good to me.Ever since we got to Egypt,   the enemy Standshave been getting stronger.   We've been winning by a hair.   Hey, Mr. Joestar,is something wrong?   My prosthetic's acting up.   I probably just needto oil the joints.   Hey you! That radio's busted!   That's odd. It's made in Japan,and I just bought it...   It's just static!Turn that thing off!   Mr. Joestar?   Yeah, I suppose we shouldrest up before heading to Cairo.   But don't let your guard down.   All right. Let's find a hotel.   How strange.   Thanks, mister.    Come again!    Hey, now it's working again!    What the...The hammer's so heavy...    What?    The nails! It hurts...    Did you bang your finger withthe hammer or something?    Watch out!    You can't just go throwinghammers around!    Geez...    Mr. Joestar...    Mr. Joestar... Wake up.    Hey, hurry up!    Polnareff won't stop blatheringabout getting breakfast.    Hurry and wake him up, Avdol!    Tell him he's got five minutes!    I thought old people get up early!    Damn smart-aleck. Has no respect...    Tell him I'll be down in a minute.    As you wish.    Did my watch stop?    But you know, Mr. Joestar...    For a man of your age,    your sleeping habitsare quite remarkable.    You're facing the wrong way.    You went to bed facing south,but woke up facing north.    A sign of youthfulness, perhaps?    I'll be downstairs.    Something's strange...Ever since yesterday afternoon...    My hand's still acting up, too.    What's wrong with this chair?It's moving on its own!    Could these floors be slanted?    For such a pricey hotel,it's sure made on the cheap.    Where should we go today?    Karnak was amazing,so I'd say something like that.    It's a little far, but how aboutthe Valley of the Queens?    What do you think you're doing,you old pervert?    Weirdo!    What just happened...    Oh, my. You naughty man.    You need to workon your approach, but...    You're j-u-s-t my t-y-p-e...    Smooch!    Something wrong!Something's really wrong!    Things have been offsince yesterday afternoon!    What?    It's...    It's stuck...    Is metal sticking to me?    Is that why metal objectsare flying toward me!    Has my body...    My body...    has it turned into a magnet?    Ow!    Is this...The work of a Stand?    But why?Why can't I see it?    How could these knives and forksfly at me without a Stand nearby?    Could it be...    Is this because of the socket onthat rock from yesterday?    That shock?    I can't pull free...    Oh, no!This escalator's made of steel!    The magnetic pull is gettingstronger by the minute!    What?    Hey, you!You in the micro-miniskirt!    You've got to help me!    Your chain's wrapped around me!    I'm getting pulled intothe escalator!    Push the emergency stop buttondown below!    Hurry! The chains arepulling me tighter...    This thing's gonna rip offmy hands and feet!    Hey, are you listening?    Have fun, Joseph Joestar.    What? So it's you...    You're the Stand user!    BASTMARIAH    So it's you...    You're the Stand user!    Once you've made contact    with the magnetic fieldof my Stand, Bast,    there's no escape.    Someone!Someone stop the escalator!    That's it!    I'll push the emergencystop button...    With my Hermit Purple!    What? Where's the stop button?    Does this escalator not have one?    Dammit!    This escalator doesn't havean emergency button!    I'm getting pulled in!    My neck!    It's gonna cut off my head!    I'm done for!    -It's gonna sever my head!-Ahem!    -This is it! I'm gonna die!-Mr. Joestar. Ahem!    Hello, Mr. Joestar.    -I'm gonna be decapitated...-Ahem.    ...by the escalator!    The escalator stoppedquite some time ago.    I pushed the emergencystop button.    It's on the side.    All good!    I just finished inspectingthis escalator.    Nothing's wrong!    The emergency buttonworks just fine!    Oh, are you the managerof this hotel?    Could you sign here please?    What's going on, Mr. Joestar?    It's a Stand.An enemy Stand's got me.    My body is like a magnet now...    She turned me into a magnet!Metal sticks to me!    Pull this thing off me!    The magnetic pullkeeps getting stronger...    That's her!That woman is the Stand user!    -What?-We have to stop her!    I have to somehow get rid ofthis insane magnetic pull,    or I won't be able to move!    Let's get Jotaro and Polnareff!They're outside.    What?    -It's... so heavy...-Avdol?    There's no time to get them!    She's getting away!    Mr. Joestar, don't stay! Go!    Right!    I have to get a good look at her!    This is...    She went intothe Ladies' Room.    Now what?    I'm going in.    My life's on the line!    -I have to catch her!-Mr. Joestar?    The old man's still not back?    Yeah, Avdol went to get him,but he's not back, either...    Oh no!    They sneaked off...    to have an amazingmeal without us?    He's just taking his timein the john.    Look, if they don't show upin the next five minutes,    we'll go look for them.    Oh, yeah. The bathroom.You're probably right...    Come to think of it, the bathroomsin this hotel are spotless...    Mr. Joestar,now that we're in here...    Just as I expected.    -We've got a problem on our hands.-Shh!    Shh...    Forgive me, but I haven't a clue...Which one do you think she's in?    She's got amazing legs.    Her legs?    Yes! Look for those legs!    You can't miss them.    We're going to peek?    No.    Nope...    And no again.    Mr. Joestar, here!    Come here! Are these her legs?    Oh, my. You're that handsome fellowfrom before.    You've come looking for me here?    Ooh! Such a filthy man...    Smooch!    It's that hag again!But she was on the second floor!    This isn't good!    We got the wrong person.This is very troubling...    How could you screw that up?    -Avdol, run!-Wai--    Perverts!    I don't deserve this!Polnareff's the one who should be    getting called a pervertin the Ladies' Room!    -Dirty old man!-Disgusting!    Perverts!    How scrumptious!    She's headed that way!    Damn it. How'd she get so far?    After her!    Avdol, I forgot to tell you,    but don't touchany electrical outlets.    No matter where they are!    That's her Stand!    You'll get zapped,and then the magnetism will get you!    I'm afraid I already did,Mr. Joestar.    What? Where?    When I pushed the emergencystop button on the escalator...    There was a socket next to it.It got me!    That little tramp...    Mr. Joestar, could you pleasegive me some space?    I can't run with youstuck to me like this.    You move, Avdol!    What are you talking about?    You're the onewho's running close to me!    Two magnetsnext to each other will...    stick together!    I can't believe she turned meinto a magnet too...    Mr. Joestar, we're in...    ...big trouble, I know!    She's so...    She's so...    ...strong!    My body, too, became a magnet...    We can't help it!We're both in her power now.    What a strong woman!    What should we do? At this rate...    I've never backed downfrom a fight!    I'm just going... to keep on fighting!
02x31 - Bastet's Mariah, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:45Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  That's her!That woman is the Stand user!  Oh, my. You naughty man.  You need to work onyour approach, but... Smooch!  Avdol, I forgot to tell you,  but don't touchany electrical outlets.  I'm afraid I already did,Mr. Joestar.  What?  Two magnetsnext to each other will...   stick together!   Mr. Joestar, we're in...   ...big trouble, I know!    EPISODE   :BAST'S MARIAH, PART      Hey! Wait!   Damn it...   She just turned the corner!After her!   Blast it! I can't believemy body's become a magnet, too!   Calm down, Avdol!   Getting hysterical won't help us.   Just focus on how to defeatthis Stand!   Now where is that woman?Damn it!   I don't see her.   Well, we can't stay herelike this forever.   Let's slowly try to stand up.   Very well.   All right, we did it.   Now, let's try to pull awayfrom each other.   Since we're stuck together,   the magnetic force holding ustogether is double.   Let's get to that fence.   Then we'll grab onand pull away from each other.   We can do it, Avdol!Get those stomach muscles ready!   Stay in sync!   Right, Mr. Joestar.   -One!-Two!   Mr. Joestar... I have to say,this is quite embarrassing.   Hey! What do you thinkyou're looking at?   We're practicing our dance moves.It's called dancing!   What a perfect dayfor dancing outdoors!   Now scram, damn it!   All right.Almost there, Avdol.   -One, two, and...-One, two, and...   We did it!We made it without falling!   Indeed...   Avdol, think you can slide off me?   Yes, I might be able to.   All right...   I'll hang on to the fence,and you slide down.   Free yourself once you're atthe tip of my foot.   Look, our faces are stuck together,so that means   my feet and your headshould repel each other.   Right...   NEGATIVE POSITIVEPOSITIVE NEGATIVE   All right! That's it.   What's wrong, Avdol?   Isn't this position a bit...   It's highly suggestive...   If anyone sees us,they might think...   No one's looking!Hurry up and slide off my...   They brought their friends!   Hey! Get lost, brats!Stop looking at us!   Hey! I said b*at it, you damn...   Avdol, hurry!Hurry up and get off me!   I'm trying...   I can't believethis is happening to me!   The embarrassment!   Fine, then I'll move!   Mr. Joestar, slow down!   Mr. Joestar, if you move like that...   It's that old hag again!   I come back for my handsome manand find this?   How dare you toywith a maiden's heart?   Cheater!   Hurry! Hurry, Avdol!The tears are coming!   You scoundrel!   Wait... This is a misunderstanding!   We did it!   We need to stay far apartfrom each other!   Your magnetic pullis getting stronger.   Curse you, damned fool!Go to hell!   There she is. It's her.   Look at her, smoking a cigarette...   Avdol, you go from that side.   Don't let her get away this time.   She's cunning.   This may be a trap.   No, Mr. Joestar...   It seems we've already falleninto her trap!   Railroad tracks!   My foot is stuck!   We're...   stuck...   -together again!-together again!   Son of a bi--   Mr. Joestar, something's...   That sound...Oh, no! We can't stay here!   Avdol, use Magician's Redto burn through the tracks!   We need to get out of here now!   But, Mr. Joestar...    It's coming! The train's coming!Hurry up and melt these tracks!    I can't.If I burn away the tracks...    The train will derail,and innocent people will die!    She's pure evil...    I could try to grab herwith my vines,    but she's out of range.    I might be able to pull us freeusing this post...    It's no use!    The magnetic pullis even stronger now.    Mr. Joestar, keep pulling!Keep trying!    It's coming! Pull harder!    Now what?    I win.    BASTMARIAH    I've won, Lord Dio!    Now to k*ll Jotaro and Polnareff!    Good thinking, Avdol!    You b*rned throughthe railroad ties    and dug a hole!    This is it!    This suits the imageof Mohammed Avdol!    This is the rolemy character plays!    Clever little bastard...    You...    sh*t-eating b*tches!    Magician's Red!    Hermit Purple!    I've got you!    Now, young lady...    I regret that I'm now goingto strangle you enough    to put you in the hospitalfor a week.    Your magnetism is rathertroublesome, you know.    What are you imagining?My chest didn't get bigger...    Your magnetism just got stronger.    This is what I had in my pockets.    The weapons I had in my pockets!    Mr. Joestar, duck!    Magician's Red!    Your magnetic force will keepgrowing stronger...    Until your bodies are crushed.    She's getting away!    No, she's not escaping.    She's keeping a certain distancebetween us.    I'm sure that woman fights by    staying neither too closenor too far.    If she gets too close to us,she'll be caught.    If she goes too far,the magnetism stops working.    This magnetismis the work of a Stand,    so it follows the rules of Stands.    Once the user is too far away,its power weakens!    What shall we do?    She said the magnetismwould keep getting stronger.    Shall we flee untilthe magnetic force expires?    No. Even if we were ableto escape this magnetism,    it won't meanwe defeated the Stand.    I, Joseph Joestar,    have strategically retreated fromfights in my younger days,    but I've never onceabandoned a fight.    I'm going to keep fightingwith all my might!    This is a map of the city.Right now, we're here.    The woman is here.    If she continues down this road,    she'll loop aroundand head back this way.    We'll split up    and catch the woman here.    I won't think of heras a woman anymore.    I'll get her, no matter what!    After her!    Hey, look.    The rails have been cut...    People from the city have arrived.    I'm sure they'll report the damagebefore the next train comes.    Let's go!    Seems like something's going on.    Someone cut the rail line!    Will the trains be okay?    They've stopped running for now.    Someone cut the rail line?    That's a pretty crappy thing to do.    Why would someone do that?Are they stupid?    You know, Jotaro...    I think people like thatwill get what they deserve.    I spent three months' pay on this.    Let's get married!    Oh, my...    Huh? Wait, what?    Huh?    They're chasingas fast as they can...    But they'll never catch me.    Stay calm. Gotta stay calm...    Looks like you can barely move now.    You won't be able tochase me anymore.    You think so?    I know these roadsbetter than you do.    Look behind you.    It's a pincer att*ck!    We've finally cornered you.    Now, at the last moment,the tables have turned!    A pincer att*ck?    You still don't get it.    You think you've cornered me,but it's you two who are cornered.    Look above you!    High voltage power lines!    Crap! Power lines are...    That's right.Power lines are magnetic.    You'll burn to a crisp!    Magician's Red!    Hermit Purple!    Avdol can defend himselfwith his flames, just barely,    but you have no chance, Joestar.    My Bast's power is far greater...    than your Hermit Purple's!    Woman, my flames will roast you!    Something's pulling me!My whole body's being pulled!    What is this?    I control flamesthat can melt steel,    but I can't defendmyself from this...    My body is being crushed!    I can't keep this up!    Joseph Joestar,since this is the end, I'll tell you...    You were quite amazing.    We've only known each otherfor a few minutes,    but you are witty and canny,and your experience gives you    the good judgmentthat young people lack.    You've gotvery charming looks, too.    Our ages are quite far apart,    but I might not have mindedbeing with you.    That's great...    Would you mind saving me, then?    Hmm...    You're a lot more powerfulthan my Hermit Purple!    I can't hold on much longer...Please. Stop the magnetism!    Well...    Nah, I don't think so.    You're nowhere near as charmingas Lord Dio.    Is there nothing that willconvince you to stop the magnetism?    No, not happening.Sorry, but you have to die.    Even though I'm begging you?    You're much too persistent,you fool.    Then you've lost, young lady.    What?    Shi--    We told you this wasa pincer att*ck!    Magnets are attractedto each other.    Once you were between us,your luck ran out.    She can't hear you, Mr. Joestar.It looks like she's passed out.    She's been crushed bythe weight and magnetic force.    I'm sure she's brokenmore than a few bones.    Now, then...Shall we go get some breakfast?    Certainly. I'm rather hungryafter all that running around.    It's already  :   a.m.    sh*t-eating b*tches...

He's about yea tall, and he's gotthe same haircut as you.    That's me! It's me!    Good grief... That was a mistake.    Wait!    You're a kid now, my boy.    Both in mind and body,you could say.    Soon, you'll lose all the memoriesyou built up during adulthood.    I'm going to forget everythingI knew as an adult?    It's true...It's all becoming a blur...    Guess it's about time, huh?    I love picking on the weak!    Attaboy, Alessi!    Hold it right there!I won't let you get away, brat.    I can't really say this too loud,    but picking on the weak reallydoes it for me. Maybe too much...    I may be a littlesick up here, but...    You know what they say...    If you think you're crazy,then you're probably not.    That must mean I'm all right.    And it feels oh so good to knowI'll never lose to some kid.    Mister! Whatever your name is hel--    So you see...    my mission is to dispose of you.    Unfortunately...    I don't have time to savor the fun.    That's Silver Chariot, huh?    I suppose I should'veexpected as much;    seems you were able to summonyour Stand when you were a kid.    But...    Chariot... Even Chariot is a kid!    Pami!    And he's weak!His sword's bent from those b*ll*ts!    My Stand, Set,reverted you to childhood.    Your mental abilities reverted too.    Meaning, your Standis also a child's Stand,    back before you two werefully attuned to each other.    Now do you get it?    Seems you do. Attaboy!    Still, as weak as it is, your Standis still at your disposal.    I shall use my Standfor your execution.    Die, Polnareff!    You're mine!    Oh, no!    It snapped!    Huh?    Take that! I meant to do that!    Ow! It hurts!    Are you all right, little boy?    He's gone!    That guy runs as soon asthere's another adult around.    I'm safe for now, but what a freak!    Wait, little boy.    You're hurt! What happened?    Huh? Uh... Um, uh...    What are you mumbling?    Huh?    Those wounds need treatment.I'll fix you up at my house.    Come on.    Should I go?    I have to defeat him or else    I won't be able to transform backinto an adult!    But he won't att*ck mewith her around.    I can think of a planin the meantime!    Come on, now.    Whoa...    Oh, right.    You're hurt. Here, grab on.    She smells good...    It hurts!    Damn it!    I'm not just going to sit back andtake this from that snot-nosed kid!    He's gonna pay...I swear I'll butcher that kid!    Doesn't look likehe's coming after me.    All right, little boy.    We're going to take a bath.Let's take those clothes off.    -Huh?-You're covered in grime.    I'll clean those wounds right upand put some medicine on you.    What are you staring at?    Oh, all right.    I'll take them off for you.Here, raise your leg.    This isn't...    What's wrong?    Nothing.    No, it is something!    It is definitely something!    I don't know why,    but I feel likeI should be really embarrassed...    And...    It's so tiny!    I don't know why,but I'm really sad. Boo-hoo!    Here, hold on.    We need to get all that dirt off.    -Here, lift your leg.-Huh?    I'm so happy!    Is it really okay if I do this?    Is it okay? Of course it is.    If we don't clean those woundsthey'll get infected.    Oh, you've got dirton your wee-wee too.    I just don't know why I'm so happy!    I guess it's all part ofbeing a "kid"!    All right, be a good boy, okay?    Okay!    Look at him... he's delirious...    I'll chop his delightedlittle face in two!    What are you grinning about?    All right. Time to wash your hair.    Huh? No!    I hate shampoo!    -It gets into my eyes! I hate it!-Rock, paper...    Scissors.    Monkey...    -Monkey do...-Monkey do...    I lost!    Now, sit down.    Does it sting?    It stings a lot.    Then can you washyour hair all by yourself?    Uh-huh, I can.    Oh! Attaboy.    Yes, that's it.    Attaboy!    That's impossible!    You fell out of the window,covered in blood...    The iron bars feel too close!    This is what it meansto be utterly helpless!    I touched the shadow again!    -Lick, lick...-The lady's gone... The lady...    What do you think happened to her?
02x33 - Set's Alessi, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:46Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  What?  I'm a kid?  Pami!  Are you okay, little boy?  I'll clean those wounds right upand put some medicine on you.  That's impossible!  Chariot!  Pami!   I'm totally outmatched!   -The nice lady's gone...-Pami!   Where'd she go?   She was just here...   She didn't even scream.What did he do to her?   Where is she?   Polnareff!   You said the shampoostings your eyes, right?   Well, since you got some in there...   Let me help you wash it off!   Thoroughly!   My short arms can't reach!   If they were just a little longer,   I could poke his eyes out and run!   So you pulled the plug, huh? Damn!   But...   This way, it'll take even longerfor the water to drain.   It'd take, what,five to ten minutes   before you'd everbe able to breathe?   Give it up!   Time to snuff you out.   How does it feel to beutterly helpless, Polnareff?   What is this?   This shape...This color! It can't be...   You didn't!   No adult would even think of...   This smell... It is!   Foul! You took a sh*t in the tub!   You thought I was helpless,but I still had one in me!   Take that!   How dare you?   Have you no basic human decency?   No hero would ever resortto something so low!   You're a very bad boy! Very bad!   Where is she?   What'd you do to her?   Where is she?   Hey! Where are you? Hey!   Hey!   What do you think I did?   Whoa, there!   We should bothwatch our step, Polnareff.   You might step on her.   What?   It can't be...   No way...This can't be happening...   Oh no...   Anyone who touches my Stand, Set,   will experience time in reverse.   Polnareff, you saw me coming   and jumped out of my shadow,   earning you a few more yearsthan your little friend.   But she touched my shadowfor several seconds.   That's why she's become a fetus!   She's alive for now,   but she'll die soon enoughoutside her mother's womb!   She got what she deservedfor helping the likes of you.   What a fool.   You scum!   Crap! I just...   Uh-oh!   You touched it again!   You're going to get even younger!   This time, perhaps four years oldor so, Polnareff.   Crap!   I have to...   I have to hurry up and b*at him,or the nice lady will...   At this rate, the nice lady will diein a matter of minutes!   I've got to b*atthat freak Alessi fast!   She made me all better.She was so caring...   I have to...   I have to hurry!   Come on!   What do you think you're doing,   running aroundcradling a dying fetus?   I'll turn you into a fetus too!   Oh no! I touched it again!   I'm getting smaller...   Yahoo!   Yes! There's no way I can lose now!   Polnareff! What are you,three years old now?   Soon your intellect will be thatof a three-year-old's, too.   Locking the door won't do any good!   Dammit! The bars aretoo close together.   Even a kid   can't slip through.   Darn!   I can't cut them...   Looks like your Chariot's becomea toddler, too!   Those bars areway too tough for it now.    Chariot's a slowpoke!    Ready or not, here I come!    Lickity-lick!    It's me, Polnareff!    Hm? He's gone...    What?    He's gone! That brat...    Did he somehow slip throughthe bars in the window?    Nice try there!    Damn you, Polnareff...Trying to trick me!    You're trying tofool me into thinking    you slipped through the window.    You must be hiding somewhere,    waiting to get the drop on me.    Not bad.    Quite cunning indeed,for a miserable little sh*t!    Come out, wherever you are...    You're so small now,you could be in that drawer.    He's probably hidingin the bucket or the drawer...    No, he might be hidingin that teddy bear.    Where could he be?I've got a one-in-three chance.    I'll get him with one swing.    I'll cr*ck open his skullwith this axe!    Gotcha! You're in the teddy bear!    Or just maybe you're...    in the grandfather clock!    I guessed wrong!    Then...    Hm, think simple... The bucket!    Huh?    So you are in the bear!    The drawer, then!    Where is he?    Impossible! He's gone!    No... He couldn't have!    The walls, floor,and ceiling are all stone.    Even if they wereone centimeter thick,    Chariot couldn't break through.    And those barsare too narrow for him.    I saw it with my own eyes.    This is insane! Where is he?Where did he go?    Outsmarted by a toddler, eh?    Gulp!    Mister Alessi.    What?    One of the goldfish disappeared...    SETALESSI    I was hiding in the fish t*nkwith a mirror!    Even a kid could figure that out!    And you totally fell for it!    You're as dumb asyou are creepy, Alessi!    A two-year-old Chariotcan still skewer your face!    Bad boy!    -Hey, wait!-Pami!    I'm going to keep attacking youuntil you break your stand's spell!    Bad boy!    Very bad boy!    That little swine!He escaped out the window!    Bad boy!    Jotaro!    Crap! I'm dead meat!    It's Jotaro! What's he doing here?    It's not often you see someonefall out the window    covered in blood...    Stay calm...    The one who stays calmat times like this wins.    Think about it... Jotaro must belooking for the grown-up Polnareff.    He has no clue who I am.    I'll do what I always do.I'll play dumb...    and att*ck himwhen he least expects it!    Ah!    My boss is goingto be so mad at me!    I was cleaning the windowand slipped!    What am I going to do?    I'm going to get inso much trouble!    Hold it right there, bastard!    Ah! Mister!    What was his name?What was it... Um...    Now's my chance! I was waitingfor Polnareff to poke his head out!    I've got you, Jotaro!    Ah! Watch out for his shadow!    I did it! He touched it!I touched his shadow!    No!    Jotaro! Now you're undermy Stand, Set's, spell!    This... Wha...    This is..    Oh, no!    He's turning turn into a kid, too!    Jotaro!    I heard you developed your Stand,Star Platinum only recently.    Which means you weren't able touse your Stand when you were a kid!    Now you're just some ordinary kid!    He's so small!    He looks like a seven-year-old!    I win! Master Dio,I'm gonna k*ll Jotaro!    You'd better give mea damn good reward!    Die, Jotaro!    Whoa! He punched him!And with his little-kid fist!    Good grief.    Don't underestimate mejust 'cause I'm a kid.    Damn! Jotaro could kick asseven as a kid?    I never knew he was that tough!And as a kid...    Mumble... Huh?    You just got off easy.Let's fix that!    Attaboy!    Stand:Set, God of Chaos and Storms    Alessi:    years old, single,    and unfortunate projectile.Out of commission!    Was I dreaming?    It's that boy's earring.    So it really did happen.    For some reason, I couldn't move...    That's right! I couldn't move,but I remember everything.    He devoted himselfto protecting me...    He fought against a grown man!    He had such a braveand heroic heart.    Where did that little boy go?    Where did my little knight go?    Where are you?Where did you go?    What an amazing woman.She was so kind...    So genuine.    That was close...    I'm back to my normal self...I wonder if she's OK.    Um, excuse me...    Did you happen to seea little boy leave my house?    He has silver hair, just like you.    Pardon me for asking,but have we met before?    No... I didn't see any kid.    Let's go, Jotaro.    Come on, hurry up.    Ah... Wait!    Could you be...    That earring...    We've never met before.    There's no way we could have met.    We're travelers,    and we've nevercome this way before.    Now, if you will excuse me,    we have to get to the next town.    So it was a dream.    Keep quiet, Jotaro.    Not a single word.    Oh! Jotaro and Polnareff!    Where have you two been?    Ah, Mr. Joestar and Avdol!    I told you two not to wander offon your own.    Look who's talking!You're the ones who disappeared!    Now, now.Let's get something to eat.    Iggy! And where the hellhave you been?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    Let me clear that away for you.    Thanks.    Finally, a little relief.    That was quite the late breakfastif you ask me.    Yeah...    We're almost to Cairo.    We've got to figure outwhere Dio is hiding.    Oh, Mr. Joestar's...    Will it appear?    I'm not sure.    But we're close, so the resultsshould be more precise.    All right, here we go!    Sir, is something the matter?    We're fine. Go away.    Yes, sir...    Well, old man?Can you see anything?    Just a little longer.    I see something...    There!    We have our final destination!    You're the onewho fell for the scam.    Oh, shut up.    Gambling isjust like relationships.    The one who cries loses.    If he does anythingeven remotely strange...    You can go home if you're scared.    Let's do it! I'll wager my soul!    Good.
02x34 - D'Arby the Gambler, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:47What is that which goes onfour legs in the morning,  two at midday,and three in the evening?  So goes the riddle of the Sphinx,  the legendary guardianof the pyramids.  The answer: Man.  Those travelerswho answered incorrectly,  the tale continues, were devouredby the ravenous Sphinx.  Now   ,    kilometersfrom Japan,  Jotaro and crew havefinally reached Cairo.   Cairo is a vast country.   We must searchthe city systematically,   working our way in toward the center.   At last, we made it.   Jotaro and the othershave reached Cairo.   But before they can reach Dio,   the team must navigate the many"Sphinxes" that stand before them.   Greetings, strangers.What can I get you?   There's somethingwe want to ask you.   We're looking for this building.   Any idea where it is?   Joseph and the otherswere exhausted.   They had been searchingfor the building in the picture   since their arrival.   Taken with Joseph'spsychic photography,   the picture revealsthe current whereabouts of Dio.   Dio was now in a new hideout,   and the Speedwagon Foundationcould not locate him.   Where is Dio?   Failure to locate him soon,   will spell certain doom for Holly.   Honored stranger, this is a cafÃ©.   It is customary to order drinksbefore asking questions.   We'll have four iced teas.   Never seen it.   Cairo is a city of six million.   There must be at leasttwo or three million buildings.   How are we going to find him?   We know he's here...   There has to be someonewho knows.   This building, huh?   How am I supposed to tellfrom a little picture?   Sorry, doesn't look familiar.   I see. Sorry to bother.   Humph.   Let's go. We'll inquire elsewhere.   I know where that building is.   -What?-What?   I'm rather familiar with it,actually.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE GAMBLER, PART      Was that you?Did you just say something?   I thought I heard you sayyou know where this building is.   Indeed.   I do know where that building is.   What? Really?   What news!   Yes! I can't believe we juststumbled upon someone   who knows where it is!   Where is it?Tell us! Where?   Are you expecting somethingfor nothing?   You've got a point.Sorry about that.   Here's ten pounds.   So, where is it?   I am a gambling man.   A sucker for cheap thrills.   You could even say I'm an addict.   It's how I make my living,you know.   Tell me... do you like to gamble?   I'm not sure what you're getting at.   Gambling. If you don't fancy it,just say so.   I told you I'm not surewhat you mean.   What I'm saying is, would you liketo play a little game?   If you win, I'll tell youthe location of your building.   You mean a bet?Look, I'm a lucky guy,   but we don't have timefor poker right now.   I'll give you another   pounds, so tell us.   A bet can be anything.   It won't take long.   For example,take a look over there.   See that cat?   So, two pieces of dried fish...   Which will the cat eat first?   The right one or the left one?   How about it?It's simple but oddly thrilling.   Enough games!   Just take the    pounds,and tell us, bastard!   Polnareff, that's not the wayyou ask someone for a favor.   OK, fine! I'll take the bet.   I pick the one on the right!   Good! Now it's getting fun.   Then I'll bet on the left.   Hey, now...   Hey, Jotaro. Are you thinkingwhat I'm thinking?   Yeah... He might be a Stand user.   He could also bea compulsive gambler.   If he tries anything,   att*ck with Star Platinum.   Got it.   And if I lose, what do I owe you?   A     pounds?    I don't need money.    How about your soul?Yes, your soul, will do just fine.    What?    What kind of joke is that?Cocky bastard.    I wish we couldget the hell out of here    and away from this freak.    So?    Yeah, whatever.    Ah, the cat has taken noticeof the fish.    He's heading right.    He's going for the oneon the right.    If I were a cat,I'd pick the bigger piece.    The one on the right looks bigger!    You all saw it.    He took the left, then the right,then ran.    I win.    Hey, smooth move, Polnareff.Just perfect...    Now how are we supposed toget the information out of him?    Now, then. As per our agreement,time to pay up.    Huh? Pay what?    Your soul.    That is indeedwhat you just wagered.    Your soul!    I am a Stand user who steals souls!    It's much easier to take people'ssouls when they lose a bet.    That's when my Stand swoops into take its prey!    My God! What the...    Polnareff!    Hold it! I wouldn't k*ll meif I were you. It's too late!    If I die, Polnareff will die, too!    Polnareff!    Hey!    He has no pulse.    He's dead! Polnareff is dead!    Polnareff!    This is Polnareff's soul.    Now Lord Dio has one less enemyto get in his way.    Such a fool...    I almost forgot.Allow me to introduce myself.    My name is D'Arby.    D-A-R-B-Y.There's an apostrophe after the D.    Gambler, stealer of defeated souls,    and user of the Osiris Stand.    And by the way, this is my cat.    You bastard!    How dare you! You call that a bet?You cheating, son of a...    Cheating?    Is that so? It's his own faultfor lacking the insight    to consider all possibilities.    You see, gambling is an analogy    for man's relationshipwith his fellow man.    It is a dance of deception.    The one who cries loses.    Are you going to k*ll me?    Go right ahead.    If you don't mind losingyour friend's soul, that is.    You listen to me!    Don't think you're walkingout of here alive!    Do you rememberwhat you were doing on    September   nd,     at   :   p.m.?    What are you talking about?    I remember quite clearly.    I was in California    gambling against an Americannamed Stephen Moor.    He said the same thingyou just said.    This is him.    The chip below him is his father,    and the one next to himis his wife.    If you want Polnareff's soul back,    you have no choicebut to continue    our little game.    This man is evil incarnate...    He's planning to take each of us,one by one.    So what'll it be?    You're welcome to goif you're scared...    I'll just keep Polnareff herefor safe keeping.    Here... have a drinkand think about it.    Care for a piece of chocolate?    Mr. Joestar, what are you doing?    Do you know whatsurface tension is, Barbie?    It's D'Arby.My name is D'Arby.    You mean, how the liquor appearsto almost overflow    but remains delicatelyon the brink?    What do you have in mind?    The rules are simple.    We take turns dropping coinsinto the glass.    Whoever makesthe liquor spill loses.    Hey, old man...    You can't mean... Mr. Joestar!    I'll bet my soul!     OSIRISD'ARBY ELDER    I'll bet my soul!    Good!    What?    This is insane! Don't!You know he cheats!    He can't cheat!    I decided the rules!    Jotaro, keep a close eye on himso he doesn't try anything funny.    OK! Fine, I accept.    But first...    Mind if I inspectthe glass and coins?    Of course.    You have the right tomake sure I'm playing fair.    A question.What guarantee do I have    that you will returnPolnareff's soul if you lose?    Gambler's honor.    If I lose, I assure you I will pay.But I will not lose.    Fine. You first.Go ahead and drop in a coin.    Mr. Joestar!    Leave this to me.    The old "coin and glass" trickis my specialty.    Surface tensionis surprisingly strong.    There's room for at leasteight or nine coins...    I just have to stay calm andmake sure my fingers don't shake.    May I drop in more than one coin?    Sure, as long asyou drop them in all at once.    Well, then...    Five coins?    Hey, that'll create a waveon the surface!    Quiet please!    Hands off the table.    It's your turn.    You've got nerves of steel,putting in five coins at once.    I'll go with one.    It's too close to call.    Typical...    He's squeezing a cotton ballbetween his finger and the coin,    and dripping liquid into the glass.    He's adding more liquidto the glass!    And he told me to watchfor cheating?    Clever bastard...    Not bad.    The glass has reached its limit!    One more coin andthe booze will spill! I win!    Just like he said,    it's not cheatingif you don't get caught!    That was a close one.I thought it was going to spill...    Your turn, Obi.    It's D'Arby.Don't make me say it again!    My name is D'Arby!    Not Obi, not Barbie!    Sorry.    He's screwing up his nameon purpose to piss him off.    The old man...    is a natural gambler.    Let's keep playing.    It's your turnto drop in a coin, D'Arby.    The shadow makes it difficultto see from here.    I'll drop in the coin fromthe right side of the table.    Drop it in from wherever you want.    The glass is already at its limit,thanks to my little trick.    There's no way the liquidcan take another coin.    It'll spill over with justthe slightest touch.    You're thinking the glasshas reached its limit.    That it's impossible, right?    Well, you're wrong...    Impossible! No!    Why didn't it spill!    What do you mean,why didn't it spill?    You saw for yourself,I dropped one in.    He made no suspicious moves.    I was watchingwith Star Platinum.    He dropped the coinin fair and square.    There's no doubt about it.    I was sure of it!    I was certainI added enough liquid    to make it spillwith one more coin!    I don't get it. There's no wayit couldn't have spilled!    How could this be?    Hurry up.    Or are you trying to waituntil it evaporates?    I can't believe it.    Mr. Joestar!    In his heart of hearts,Joestar realized he had lost!    That's why his soul emerged.    I, D'Arby, have won this bet!    Polnareff, forgive me.    Holly, I've let you down.    Mr. Joestar!    Old man!    Two down!    Now, then.Let's continue our game.    Unless you've decidedto abandon these two    and crawl off withyour tails between your legs.    You bastard!    You don't get it, do you?    If you k*ll me,your two friends die too.    Damn it!    Avdol, stop!    Hey! If you're going tocause trouble,    I'll have to ask you to leave!    Shut up and stay out of this!    Yes, sir!    You're too late, Jotaro.    Is something wrong withthe glass?    This is why the coin didn't makethe booze spill over.    There's a tiny bit of chocolateon the bottom of the glass.    He must have stuck it onwhen he inspected    the glass and coins atthe beginning of the game.    You know the rules.    It's not cheatingif you're never caught.    What do you mean?    How could a piece of chocolateallow him to drop in an extra coin?    It's melted now,    but it was a solid chunk atthe bottom of the glass.    Just enough toslightly tilt the glass,    but not enough for us to notice.    Once it melted,the glass became level,    making room for another coin.    What?    But...    How could he have knownthe chocolate    would melt at that exact moment?    He used the sun.    It slipped my notice.    When he moved tothe right side of the table,    he allowed the sun to shinedirectly onto the chocolate,    thereby melting it.    All right,    D'Arby,    get your cards.    We're playing poker.    Jotaro!    Very interesting!    Poker is my absolute favorite!     Poker? This is a manwho just outsmarted Mr. Joestar!     It's too dangerous!     I know, he's tough.     He may not use strength,    but he's the most dangerous Standwe've ever faced.    Well...    There's no turning back.    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    -Draw three.-I'll draw two.    He's not doing anything suspicious,and yet...    Cheating is all about findinga mental blind spot.    There's only one joker.    Well, then, Jotaro...    Very well. I'll wager my soul.
02x35 - D'Arby the Gambler, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:47Before we get started,there's something I want to check.  Shuffle those cards.  They're shuffled.  What now?  Draw a card from the deck.  It doesn't matter where.  Just make sureno one else sees it.  OK.  I'll tell you which one it is:the six of hearts.   I'll name the cardsin order from the top.    Five of spades, queen of diamonds,jack of spades, ace of hearts,    seven of diamonds, six of clubs,king of clubs, two of diamonds.   He's right!   And D'Arby shuffled the deck...   How did you...   I can tell you the entire deck.   Star Platinum sawthe order of the cards   when they were shuffled.   Very interesting.   But all I have to do is shuffle the cards   where you can't see them.   Don't you get it?   It's not going to be so easyfor you anymore   to cheat with me as your opponent.   Just something I thoughtyou should know.   Good.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE GAMBLER, PART     The security seal.   An unbroken seal means the deckhas not been tampered with.   One joker.   I don't see anything unusual.   It's a normal deck.   The page number is    ...      ... No, page    .   Hasn't failed me yet.   I can tell which page it issimply by touch.   Jotaro's Star Platinum may haveincredible visual prowess,   but I can remembereverything by touch.   I know the exact locationof every card, shuffled or not.   OK! Open the game!   Ten of hearts.   Seven of clubs.   I'll be dealing then.   I need to shuffle the cards atan angle Star Platinum won't see.   Cut the deck.   And now I'll deal.   Jotaro... Me...   What? What happened?   Jotaro, his finger!   Star Platinum just brokeD'Arby's finger!   I told you.   You won't be cheating anymore.   He tried to cheat? When?He was just dealing the cards...   I didn't see him doanything suspicious.   No. Take a good look at the cardsin his left hand.   The second card is sticking out...   That's the cardhe tried to deal me.   He pretended to deal the top card,   but was about to deal methe second card from the top.   Which means...   The top card would havegone to him.   He would've had three tenswith that card.   The so-called second deal.   A sleight-of-hand technique   in which the dealer dealsthe second card in the deck,   instead of the expectedtop card deal.   Performed by an expert,the cheat is almost imperceptible.   What's more,   D'Arby knows the location ofevery card in the deck by touch.   You trash.How dare you break my finger...   I was being nice.   You're lucky I didn't rip it off.   Good grief. I guess I can't let youcut the deck anymore.   Someone else is going do itfrom now on.   That boy over there on the hilllooks like he could help.   Good.   Avdol, ask him to come here.   Certainly.   Impressive...   To cheat successfully, one mustexploit the element of surprise.   It takes more than sharp eyesto prevent that.   It appears I underestimated you,given you caught my second deal.   I'll accept my fractured fingeras punishment.   And now, I'll devote my fullconcentration to our game, Jotaro.   I haven't done so since my colossalgamble on May   th,     ...   against a Japanese manknown as Shozo Mayama.   I won his eight Tokyo properties,and his soul!   His wealth had not dulledhis gambler's instincts.   I'm not here for Lord Dio.   I'm here becauseI was born to be a gambler!   What do you think you're doing?   Those are Mr. Joestar'sand Polnareff's souls!   I've split their soulsinto six chips each.   In poker,if you think you might lose,   you can fold.   You need to be able to drop outand up the ante,   so we can't playwith just two chips.   Winning back six chips,   is the equivalentto winning one soul.    Got it?    Now, Jotaro. If we play, you'll getyour chance to win back the chips.    But I still haven'theard you say it.    Fine. I'll bet my soul.    Good!    Jotaro...    Those pure white chipsrepresent your soul.    Once I win all six,    your soul is mine.     OSIRISD'ARBY ELDER    I'll bet one chip of Polnareff's soul.    Let's begin!    In this game of poker,each player is dealt five cards.    Players have one chance to improvetheir hand by swapping out cards.    But it's the betting that makespoker a game of psychology.    Now then, I suppose I'll raise.    Keep in mind Jotaro, those sixwhite chips are your soul.    Think before you make your move.    Listen, it's okayif you don't understand.    You don't have to worry.    Just cut and deal the cardsthe way you know how.    OK...    Give me three cards.    My, my, that's quitethe frightful glare.    You must have a very good hand.    I guess I'll play it safeand bet one more Polnareff.    Call.    If you don't fold, you needat least three chips per game.    All right! Come on, Jotaro!    Two pair, eights and nines.    Oh, sorry.    Two pair, jacks and queens.    That was close.I almost lost that one.    So then...    He has only three left.    Jotaro...    OK, next game. Deal the cards.    Only the next gamemay be your last.    One card.    What's wrong, Jotaro?    Hurry up and look at your hand.    Decide whetheryou'll change or fold.    Jotaro?    No...    these cards will do.    What?    Um, pardon me...    What was that?    I think I misheard you.    I could have sworn I heard you say"these cards will do."    You heard right. These cards will do.    I'll play with this hand.    I know that!    I'm asking if you intend to    play those cardswithout looking at them.    These cards will do.    Don't mess with me! Answer me!    How can you play withoutlooking at the cards?    Avdol, I have a favor to ask.    A favor?    Of course, but why won't youlook at your cards?    Answer me, Jotaro!    I'll raise you another two and...    I'll throw in Avdol's soul.    Wh...    What?    D'Arby, you are impressive.    Sure, you're no matchfor our Stands physically,    but you're cunning andcalm under pressure.    I'm no gambler.You could read me like a book.    I would certainly loseagainst the likes of you.    But I trust Jotaro.    I don't know whyhe won't look at his cards,    but if he asks me for my soul,I won't waver.    My soul is in Jotaro's hands.    I see...    Seems you both have crackedunder the pressure.    Boy!    I said "one card"!Hurry up and deal me!    Yes, sir...    Master D'Arby,I dealt just as you asked.    His hand is worthless.I'm sure of it.    My skills as a dealer never fail.    You've won. I know it!    Jotaro thinks the boyhas nothing to do with us.    But everyone in this cafÃ©    and everyone within sightof this place is my associate!    Even the bartender andthose men over there!    No matter who deals, I can't fail!    My directive is infallible.Jotaro's hand has to be a weak one.    Though, admittedly, not lookingat the cards was a bold move.    He caught me by surprise,albeit briefly...    It's a bluff!How dare he bluff against me?    Does he really think I'll fold?What a fool...    Very well.    I'll match you with six Polnareffs.    And...    I raise you Joseph's soul!    A total of fifteen chips!    What?    What? Hold on a minute!    Jotaro doesn't have any more chips!    He's out of chips, you say?Of course he does.    What do you mean?    All my Stand needsis a written contract.    Then it will be ableto take a soul.    Whose soul could yoube talking about?    Did you forget about your friendKakyoin, in the hospital?    -You can bet his soul!-What?    Panic, fool!    Show me your doubt and fear!    Let me see you losethat cool composure!    How dare he try tobluff against me?    I'll destroy him.    I'll turn that poker face intoa miserable ball of anguish!    Fine.    I'll see you with Kakyoin's soul.    Jotaro!    You can't bet a man's soulwithout his knowing!    I guess it is kind of selfish.    Hey, Jotaro! What did you just do?    What did I do?What are you talking about?    You just lit a cig...    What's wrong? Not feeling well?    This little...    Such confidence! Could he have...    Could he have used Star Platinumto swap the cards without my knowing?     I, JOTARO KUJO, AGREE TO SURRENDERTHE SOUL OF MY FRIEND NORIAKI KAKYOIN     IN THE EVENT THAT I LOSE.JOTARO KUJO    Stupid brat!    Don't look at mewith that worried grimace!    If Jotaro finds outyou work for me, I'll m*rder you!    Damn fool!    I have four kings.    The only hands that couldb*at me are four aces,    a straight flush,or a joker-led five of a kind.    To get any one of those hands,    Jotaro would haveto switch all five cards.    Sure, with Star Platinum's speed,    there's a chance he could haveswitched one of the cards.    But five? Could he have switchedall the cards right under my nose?    No! Completely impossible!    There's no way I could have missedhim replacing all five cards.    Not the great D'Arby!    All right, Jotaro!Your time's come!    He lit a cigaretteto psych me out! He's bluffing!    You got a drink? When did you...    You bastard!How dare you mock me?    Come on, let's do this!    My hand is--    Hold it.    I haven't raised the pot yet.    What?    Raise?    You don't have anything to...    I'll raise you my mother's soul.    What?    Your mother?Jotaro, you're betting Holly's soul?    I came to Egypt to save my mother.    If I lose here, she'll die anyway.She won't mind if I bet her soul!    Now D'Arby,    you better bet somethingthat matches my mother's soul.    I want you...    to tell me the secret of Dio's Stand!    He knows...    He knows Dio's secret.    But Dio does nottake lightly to treason.    If he tells us,D'Arby's as good as dead.    Jotaro... If you're that confident,    you know your hand will win,don't you?    You wouldn't let us down,would you?    You've got the winning hand,right? Jotaro?    Well? Call or fold?    Spit it out already, D'Arby!    I'll say it!    I'll say it, damn it!    I'll say it!    I'm the world's greatest gambler!    I can do this! I'll call!    Call...    I'm going to call!    Ca...    C... Ca... C...    I can't! I'm petrified!I'm speechless!    I'm too terrified...The words won't come!    C...    I can't breathe...    C... Ca...    Ca...    His eyes rolled back...    He fainted on his feet!    The pressure was just too much.    Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's soulsare returning to their bodies!    Thank God!    Inside, he had already given up.    Deep down, he knew he had lost.That's why the souls were released.    Four kings?    He had four kings!    Jotaro, what was your hand?    I knew it...    Your hand was sh*t!    Even Star Platinumwouldn't have been able to    swap cards in front ofan expert gambler like D'Arby.    Luckily my bluff and intimidation worked.    But with such a worthless hand...    Good grief. Had I known,I would've freaked.    Freaked?    Jotaro, you bet our soulson that worthless hand?    His collection of souls appearsto have been released.    Come on, everyone!Let's play mahjong!    Backgammon is a lot of fun, too.    And, oh,I love a good game of dice.    Even if you have no chance!    D'Arby, User of the Osiris Stand.Status: Retired    I doubt we'll be able to getDio's secret out of him now.    He was a formidable opponent.    He almost singlehandedlytook us all out.    He was impressive.    Yes, he was fierce.    Ugh, what just happened?    Guess we can't be the heroesevery episode.    My daughter's conditionhas worsened.    I was talking about you.    Not prepared? Don't lie to me!    Women make you do that.    You saved my life!    Mondatta and Hol Horsewill be an invincible duo!
02x36 - Hol Horse and Boingo, Part 1 / Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:48sh*t, it's so dark.I can't see a thing.  Where is that bastard?  It's broad daylight, and I still haveto feel my way around this dump.  It must've been that room.  Dio must be in there...  What the? These are Dio's leftovers?  Damn broads just throwthemselves at him.  Like they want himto drink their blood.  Nuts, if you ask me.   Guess good's got nothin' on evil.   Besides,where'd he get all this gold stuff from?   This guy can have and do anything.   Did you   want something?   Master Dio!   Damn it.   Just looking at himgives me the chills.   Keep cool, Hol Horse.   Don't let him get to you.   He's nothing.He's only slightly stronger than you...   I repeat,did you want something, Hol Horse?   Ah, uh, well...I came to inform you that,   well, it seems two ofthe Nine Great Gods,   Mariah and Alessi,have been defeated.   And?   And that's not all.   Joestar and the others willarrive in Cairo tomorrow.   Only three of the Nine Gods remain.   When I said, "And"   I was asking about you, Hol Horse.   When will you exterminate them,Hol Horse?   You swore your loyalty to me,   but you've yet toprove yourself in battle.   Anyone can relay information.   You failed me twice,and now you've crawled back to me.   My body once belonged to a man   by the name of Jonathan Joestar.   He was the grandfatherof Joseph Joestar.   Look.   Notice how the left takes longer to heal?   The left side of this body is weak.   It proves that it isn'tyet completely mine.   That I am not yet immortal.   I am ill-equippedto engage in battle with them.   Now you must destroy Joestarand the others.   On my behalf...   If not, I shall k*ll you.   You're messing with the wrong guy!   You think you canthr*aten me into doing you a favor?   Humph... on his behalf...   I'm no fool.   I just side with whoever's strongest.   That was just lip service.I'd never really swear loyalty to you.   I'm not gonna sell you my soul.   Bastard! You're not so tough!   You're wide open!   Seems you're nottoo coordinated yet...   Come to think of it,   I don't have to fight Josephand the other three...   I've got Dio all to myself.   It'd be a hell of a lot easierto blow his head to smithereens   right here, right now.   Then the treasure's mine!   This'll be a piece of cake!   He has no ideaI'm aiming Emperor   point-blank at his skull.   I can finish him off right now.   All it takes is a little pullof the trigger...   It'll be over in an instant.   Emperor was madefor close-combat carnage!   I can do this. I can do this!   What are you doing?You seem to be hesitating.   Die!   I'll splatter your brainsall over the floor, Mister Dio!   Do you really want to sh**t me?   He's gone.   There is something about you.   As you were about to pull the trigger,you did not perspire.   Your breathing was relaxed.   You were completely calm.Impressive, Hol Horse.   How did he do that?   But I didn't see him...   There's no wayhe could have stepped behind me   without breakingany of those spider webs.   No matter how fast he is.   How? How did he get behind me?   I don't understand.   Was that Dio's Stand, The World?   Ill-equipped?Ill-equipped my ass!   I finally understand, Master Dio.   I've got to pledge my allegiance.   You've got me b*at...    EPISODE   :HOL HORSE AND MONDATTA, PART     Ladies and gentlemen,   we hope you enjoyed our flightfrom Aswan today.   We will be arriving on schedule   at Cairo International Airport shortly.   Whoops! 'Scuse us.   Guess it's our cab.    Thanks.    Got a problem there, buddy?    My god...    Take me to Mena House Hotelin Giza, pronto.    I'm going to open the suitcase.    Shut your lids if you don't wantthose peepers to hurt. Got it?    Huh? Did you just say something, sir?    I wasn't talking to you.    Shut up and drive.    Yes, sir.    It's your own damn faultI had to put you on the plane like this.    Next time don't make such a fuss.    Don't be such a baby, Mondatta.    Your brother's got another month    in the hospital thanks to that b*mb.    You're my partner now.    We're gonna use your bookof premonitions and my assassin g*n    to stamp out Jotaro, Joseph,and all of them. Got it, Mondatta?    Listen. I know that you're shy.    That you're afraid of just about anyonebesides your brother, Zenyatta.    But don't you want to avenge your brother?    Do you really wanna be a coward forever,Mondatta?    I'm out of options myself!    We're gonna fight!    We're gonna get our revenge, Mondatta!    I'm going to untie you now,    but you swearyou won't wail and scream?    All right. Good boy.    Don't get too nervous,you'll get sick.    I'm on your side. Don't worry.    Relax.    Sir? Wha--Did you throw up?    Shut up!    Oh... Plane made you sick?    Let's be pals, Mondatta.    I'm Mondatta. This is Hol Horse.    He's mean. I don't like him!    While Mondatta was sleeping,    Hol Horse tied him up andstuffed him in a trunk.    Mondatta was takenfrom his brother, Zenyatta.    He was so sad!    But Mondatta wantedto avenge his brother.    Even though he was very scared,    he worked up his courageand teamed up with Hol Horse.    You won't even get near me?    Well, I guess you're trying.    I heard your Stand predicts the future.Is that really true?    Hell, it better be.    It's the whole reasonI brought you here.    Then again,if your predictions are so great,    why'd your brother get blown sky high?    Answer me!Your Stand predicts the future, right?    A new comic appearedon the blank page...    While Mondatta and Hol Horse werewalking around the outskirts of Cairo,    they met a very pretty lady.    Then Hol Horse suddenly jumpkicked the lady in the neck!    The lady was so happy,    she gave Hol Horse her jewels.    Yay! We're rich!    What in the...    You've got to be kidding me!    You call this a prediction, Mondatta?    This is crazy!There's no way this could happen!    My... My Stand...Thoth's prophecies are    never wrong!    They're    % right.    One hundred percent?Quit messing with me, kid!    Some broad is gonna give me her jewelsafter I jump-kick her in the neck?    No one would ever do that!    Listen, Mondatta.    I'm a gentleman.    I got girls all over the world.    Sure, I might tell a white lie nowand then, but I'd never hit them!    I respect all ladies.    The beauties, the dogs, all of 'em!    There's no wayyour prediction's coming true.    I swear, I won't hit a woman.    Nope, never.Even if she paid me!    It's    % true, yes.    See? The prediction was wrong!    Who the hell are you?    This is...There was a scorpion in your shawl!    -That thing's sting kills!-What?    You spotted the scorpion beforeit could crawl into my clothes.    If you hadn't k*lled it,it would've stung her for sure...    You saved my life. I must repay you.    How about my necklace?    Please take it.    We're invincible!    Mondatta and I are the unstoppable duo!    THOTHMONDATTA    So the building in the picture, huh?    I've been repairing roofs in Cairofor over    years,    and I've never seen a place like this.    From the looks of it,    thing was built abouta     years ago.    I'd guess it's somewhere    south of here.    The buildings in Cairo get olderthe farther south you go.    Huh...    Sorry I couldn't be much help.    No, thanks, sir. Sorry to bother you.    I see. OK, thank you.    I called Japan...    My daughter's much worse.    She's lost all her strength.    She has three, maybe four days.    I can feel it.    Dio is near.    He's hiding somewhere close by.    He has to be around here somewhere.    Let's go.    We'll find him.    We'll talk to everyone we can.    Yes. All we can do is keep on.    We meet again...    Man, I'm getting sick of those faces.    I never thought they'd make itso close to Master Dio's mansion...    They're almost there.    By the way...    Mondatta!    About your new prediction...Are you really sure it's right?    This is just too...There's no way this could happen!    My, my...    "My premonitions are    % accurate."That's what you're trying to say?    They are, yes.    Damn it! I'm supposed to believe this?    You've lost it, boy.    "There, we found them!"shouted Hol Horse.    "Joseph, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol!"    "Darn it!," Hol Horse fumed."They're almost to Master Dio's manor!"    "Gosh-darn bafoons.They each get a b*llet between the eyes!"    Hol Horse was full of bad thoughts.    "You're gonna pay for whatyou did to my brother!"    Mondatta was very furious.    But, Hol Horse, couldn't use his g*n,    the Emperor, in the market.    "Now, Hol Horse," Mondatta instructed,"stick your fingers up Polnareff's nose."    And then...    "We did it! They're out cold fromlosing all that blood!"    Lucky you, Hol Horse!    This is your chance to finish them off!    Like hell I'm gonna believe that!    This is the premonition?    Stick my fingers up Polnareff's nose?    What the hell is this crap, Mondatta?    I get the part about k*lling themand all, but...    I mean it, boy, don't mess with me!    Listen. Even if I am supposed tostick my fingers up Polnareff's nose,    I'd have to somehow getclose enough to him to do it!    It's much faster if I put a b*llet in himwith my Emperor. Am I wrong?    You won't be ableto fire a b*llet... yes.    Even if you try,    fate won't let you... yes.    Trust me... yes.    If you try to go againstwhat's in the comic,    you'll suffer.    It's fate... yes.It's    %... yes.    But your brother followed the comicand nearly d*ed.    My brother was tryingto save himself    and disguised himself    as Jotaro without thinking... yes.    If he had trusted what he readand not disguised himself,    then the real Jotaro wouldhave been blown up... yes.    The premonition was correct... yes.    What to do...    Polnareff's gone.    Hey, where's Polnareff?    Where'd he go?    sh*t! It can't be...    Don't move!    Or I'll lance you head to toe.    Polnareff...    Fool!And what do you think you're doing?    Keep your hands where I can see them.    I thought I saw someonestalking us like a hyena.    And sure enough,it's our old friend, Hol Horse.    Still haven't learned your lesson?Still trying to k*ll us, huh?    Thanks for the good times back in India.    You're lucky Avdol survived.    Or else you'd be dead already.    Are you by yourself, Hol Horse?    Nah, you wouldn't be here alone.    You probably have someone nearby,    don't you?    sh*t!    At least he hasn't noticed Mondatta yet.    I still have a chance...    He can see you!The book! Your fingers!    You're not much ofa thr*at on your own,    but you've got a knackfor picking allies.    If you've found another helperlike before,    you could be seriously dangerous.    So where is he?Where's your Stand-wielding partner?    Your fingers...    Hide your fingers, Mondatta.

Hey, Polnareff, was that you?   Polnareff!   Oh, there you are.   What's the matter?   Was someone following us?   Er...   Damn it! I'm cornered.   I thought I was supposedto get my big chance   after I stuck my fingers upPolnareff's nose!   I'm in a whole lotta trouble!    Something wrong, Polnareff?    No.   If Avdol finds out I'm here,I'm a goner!   I think I'm gonna cry.   If I knew this was going to happen,   I would've just blown him awayfrom a distance!   Dammit, Mondatta!   I was faster than Polnareff, but...   Crap!   Polnareff?   Tell them to scram!   If they catch me,you're going down with me, Polnareff.   No one was following us.   Guess it was just my imagination.   I see.   And what are you doingstanding there like that?   Tell them you were taking a leak.You were pissing!   Oh, you know just taking a wizz.   What?   You were peeingin the middle of the street?   You amaze me sometimes.   Stop jabbing that g*n into my head!   That's it!I'll make a little gesture.   God I hope they figure it out.   Look where my tongue is pointing!   I'm trying to give you a sign!Behind me!   Behind me, damn it! Behind me!   Why are they being so quiet?   Ah, well. You guys go on ahead.   All right.   I was lying!   It was a lie! Don't leave me!   Look at my tongue. Behind me!   Behind me, damn it!Come on, just look!   What's wrong?   Why are you making that face?   Does your tongue hurt?   No, he's signalingsomething's behind.   You idiot! Shut up!   You don't mean...   Polnareff!   You son of a...   You were signalingsomething to them!   That's it! You've pissed me offfor the last time!   Die!   What?   -Huh?-It's him!   What the hell? He sneezed?   It's Hol Horse! Watch out!   He's got a friend hidingunder the crate!   Blast it! This can't be happening.   He sneezed because I jammedmy fingers up his nose!   Damn! If he hadn't sneezed,   I could've at leastgotten Polnareff.   I should've neverteamed up with you, Mondatta!   They're gonna k*ll me!   It's all because ofthat blasted premonition!   I'm doomed!   Brother, look! Look who's there!   That's him, all right.   It's the bastardwho blew off my ear at the airport.   I'll run him over!   What?   This is...    It all happened so fast.    They had no time to stopthe truck with their Stands    I stuck my fingers up his nose,and the prediction came true.    I can't believe it.All four of them at once!    It's fate, yes.    My premonitions are always right.    But it's too soon to finish them.    We must wait forthe next prediction, yes.    Okay!    EMPERORHOL HORSE    âWe did it!â, they proclaimed.    The chance to finish offtheir enemies had arrived!    But be careful, you two.    Don't rush in. Hide and wait.    It's still too soon to move in.    Three of them are knocked out,but Jotaro's still conscious.    He's about to get up!    Jotaro wasn't hit directly.    That was a close one.    If we had crept up to him,he could've att*cked us.    He's looking for me.    He's wondering why I split    instead of blowinghis head straight off.    We're gonna b*at 'em right,Mondatta?    We've made it this far.I have to win whatever it takes.    You're with me right, Mondatta?    Yeah.    We're almost there.    So Mondatta, what do we gotta do nextto k*ll these guys?    Your comic's predictionsare    % accurate.    I believe you!    I'll do whatever I have to.    If it tells me to stick my fingersup something, I'll do it.    If it tells me to eat crap,I'll eat it.    I have to win!    There... it is!    It finally appeared, yes.    -The final prediction!-What?    Here we go! Hol Horse'snext att*ck will be his last!    Hol Horse came acrosstwo plumbers repairing drainpipes.    Then he paid themto open one of the pipes.    If Hol Horse firesall of his b*ll*ts into that pipe    at exactly twelve noon...    Hey, looks like there wasa car accident around the corner.    Who cares? Let's finish this thing.    Here, hold this pipe.    Okay.    What happensif I fire into the pipe?    Come on! Turn the page!    I fire my g*n into the pipeand then what?    And the b*ll*ts flew outthe other end!    Ka-boom! Hol Horse's b*ll*tswent right through Jotaro's skull!    Right smack in the middleof his forehead!    Yes!    This is it, yes!    I've been waiting for this, yes.    This is whatI've been waiting for, yes.    That's great!    I mean, it looks great,but hold on a sec!    What if we read it wrong?Then we're toast!    Look at this page.    This is the predictionfrom when your brother    tried to wipe out Jotaro.    But your brother was the onewho got blown up!    That's because my brothertransformed himself into Jotaro    without thinking, yes.    But you and I cannottransform ourselves, yes.    That's right!I don't have any disguise powers!    I couldn't even pretendto be Jotaro.    Does that mean...    It does! Yes.    I can avenge my brother! Yes!    There's no way to misinterpretthis prophecy, yes.    If you sh**t your b*ll*tsinto this pipe,    Jotaro will die!    Yes!    But wait.    It said a time.    At the stroke of noon, wasn't it?    Wait, twelve o'clock sharp?    We have two minutes!    Don't panic.    All you have to do is aim your g*ninto the pipe and fire, yes.    You have plenty of time, yes.    It's fate.It will happen.    I know. It's    %!    I believe you. I believe you, but...    I'm under the g*n.    I gotta hustle!    Hey, you guys! Listen up.    Open that pipe!    Just do it!    Hey, who do you thinkyou're talking to?    Who the hell do you think you are?    You wanna die!Hurry the hell up and open it!    Hol Horse, ordinary peoplecannot see your Stand, yes.    The comic saysyou pay them, yes.    Huh? Pay them?    Now only one minuteten seconds left!    Okay, I'll pay you!    All right! I'm sorry!I'll pay you to open it!    Please! Just open it!    Pay us? What a weirdo.    You'll pay usjust to open the pipe?    Then sure. Hand it over!    Right.    Hey, what's the problem?    I don't have any money!    That's right!I left my wallet at the hotel.    Who is this guy?    Mondatta!    Remember, if you got lost?I gave you some change just in case.    Give it to me. Hurry!    Yes.    We've got    seconds. Faster!    Here's your change purse.There's a lot of money.    Hey, one rolled behind the bricks.    It's just coins,but there's a lot of them.    How much you think there is?    Looks like maybe    pounds!Hey, you're stepping on one.    -Oh, you're right.-Pick the damn coins up later!    You can have it all!    Here you go, boys.It's almost noon.    I made you some tea.    Take a load offand have some lunch.    Oh, sounds good to me.    Listen, granny! I was here first!Now scram!    Thanks, ma'am.    You sons of!I said hurry up and open it!    Or I'll cr*ck your heads openwith this rock!    Okay, it's open.    Out of the way!    Die, Jotaro!    I did it!Just like the prediction said!    I sh*t 'em at the stroke of noon!    Go get him!    Wake up, old man.    I think I'll be okay.    Me too.Just minor cuts and bruises.    But Polnareff is...    Someone get this damn blockoff of me.    I won!    He's right in front of the pipe!    What?    Hey, hey.    Sorry, Jotaro.    I don't knowwhat Hol Horse was thinking,    but he stuck his fingersright up my nose.    The guy's disgusting.    It still itches. Sorry.    My b*ll*ts!    They missed!    Mondatta!What are you trying to pull?    What the hell is going on?    I don't know, yes.    My predictions are always true!It's fate!    I can't believe it!    My predictions have neverever been wrong, yes!    Look! Jotaro and the othersare still alive.    Not one b*llet hit any of them!    The prediction was totally wrong!    You little...    Tune in next time.    Now for the twelve o'clock news...    Huh?    What? It's noon now?    My watch!    It's fast!    That means I firedthe b*ll*ts too soon.    It's exactly noon!    What's gonna happen?    What's gonna happen now?    It can't be...    The prediction said the b*ll*ts would goright through Jotaro's forehead    at the stroke of noon.    Hol Horse, the b*ll*ts are...    What's gonna happen next?    Hey, did you hear that?I thought I heard someone scream.    I don't know what's going on,but something's fishy.    This truck.    Let's get out of herebefore the cops show up.    What the hell happenedto Hol Horse, anyway?    I don't know.    He disappeared for some reason.    Careful, Jotaro. Get awayfrom that pipe before you get soaked.    Is he dead?    No, but he's critical.    I have no idea what happened,    but looks like a b*lletwent through his forehead    and out the top of his head.    One centimeter lower,and he would have been a goner.    He's a very lucky man.    My prediction was correct.    And this was Hol Horse's fate.    But that Jotaro,    how lucky can he be?    Both my brother and Hol Horselost to fate.    Master Dio is the only onewho can defeat him.    Zenyatta,    Hol Horse taught methat revenge is just a big joke.    I'm going to forget about Jotaro.    From now on, I'm going to usemy prophetic powers    for our happinessand for the happiness of others.    Maybe people will start to like us.    Maybe our futurewill be a little brighter.    I'm sick of spending my lifecowering under a box,    afraid of everyone.    I learned a lot from this battle.    I'm coming home, Brother.    I'm coming home to Aswan,to join you.    Sorry.I kicked it without thinking.    I didn't mean to hit you.    Forgive me.    Wait, this dog...    I think I've seen him before,but where?    This dog!It couldn't be!    No!    Hey, by the way,where'd that dumbass dog go?    Iggy?    I'm sure he's scroungingfor food somewhere.    I told youthat he wouldn't help us.    If people could change that easily,life wouldn't be so hard.    Sure enough, Mondatta joinedHol Horse in the hospital,    meeker than ever.    Ba-dum-tss!    Iggy hates being with others.    I was looking for youbecause I have a request.    No doubt about it.It's this mansion.    By the way, where'd Iggy go?    Good grief. I can't let a kidwho likes dogs die.
02x38 - The Guardian of Hell, Pet Shop, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:49Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  So the buildingin the picture, huh?  I've been repairing roofs in Cairofor over    years,  and I've never seena place like this.  My daughter's much worse.  She has three, maybe four days.  I can feel it.  Dio is near.  Let's go.   We'll find him.We'll talk to everyone we can.   Man, it's scorching out here today.   I haven't had a showerin nearly two days.   It's ruiningmy gorgeous good looks.   What's the matter, jerk? You havesome kind of problem with me?   Not too bright there, eh?   I'm telling you to move!   What's a foreigner like you doingsitting here like some beggar?   Who told you to sit here?   Ah, you're a beggarfrom a foreign land.   It isn't much, but...   Hey, this is...   You bastard! How dare you?   This is supposed to bemy turf, damn it!   Your turf?   Polnareff!   Don't sit there.   Give that money to him.   So he's a beggar?   Excuse my friend.   He's not accustomedto the rules of this town.   Well, why didn't you just tell meyou're a beggar?   Cause that's my shtick!I'm a mute beggar!   There's a beggars'association here.   Beggars have their own areaswhere they are paid to sit and beg.   It may seem strange,   but their own rules helpkeep everything in order.   Huh!   Tsk! You bruised my ego!   I wonder if I'll make more money   if I just disguise myselfas a foreign beggar.   Well, there's always tomorrow.   By the way,I thought you looked familiar.   You're Avdol, the fortune teller.   I heard you fled to Japan'cause someone was trying to k*ll you.   Actually,I've been looking for you.   You know everything there isto know about this area,   so I wanted to ask you a favor.   You'll be well rewarded.   We need to find this building.   And we're short on time.   Well, that's enough workfor one day.   I'll find that mansion in three hours.Wait right there.   By the way, did anyone see Iggy?    EPISODE   : THE GUARDIAN OF HELL,PET SHOP, PART     It's a definite match.   That's the place.   And just in two hours.   There's nothingI can't find in this city.   Huh?   Meanwhile,Iggy thought to himself...   That bird is a Stand userjust like me.   It made that giant piece of iceand k*lled 'em.   He's protecting that place.   It kills anyonewho gets close to the mansion.   And that bird's...   gonna come after me next!   From very early in their history,   the ancient Egyptians recognizedthe prowess of the noble falcon   soaring high above the Nile valley.   They trained the birdas their hunting partner,   and considered ita representation of Horus,   guardian deity of the royal family.   Capable of spotting preyseveral kilometers away,   the falcon's eye is symbolizedby the Eye of Horus,   an emblem of protectionand royal power.   This is Pet Shop,   wielder of the Stand Horus,god of the sky.   Iggy wondered.   Looks like I just stumbled onDio's mansion,   that place Jotaro was looking for.   And it used its Stand to make   that giant hunk of ice.   It's a guard dog,I mean a guard bird.   You've got to be kidding me!   I couldn't care lessabout this Dio guy.   I was dragged here,   forced to be some allyto the Joestars!   Like hell I'm gonnafight this thing!   All I want is a little r-and-r,a girl of my own,   and some place to settle down.I don't wanna hurt anybody!   'Sides, if I fight this freakn bird,what's in it for me?   I'm not putting my lifeon the line here!   Time to playthe old "dumb dog" routine.   He'll never guess I haveanything to do with those guys!   Those eyes...   You can never tellwhat a bird's thinking.   I bet my Stand could b*at him.   Then again, there's a real good reasonI'm making a fool of myself.   I've got nothing to do with Jotaroand those other guys!    Go back to your mansion,you damn bird!    That bird.    What's with that bird?It's not moving!    It's too late!    I'm gonna run it over!    What was that bird?    It flew under this car?It's so low!    It didn't even tryto get out of the way.    It dove right under.    Crazy bastard!    Looks like he's lostinterest in me, for now.    Seems he att*cksonly when someone tries to get inside.    Even so,if Jotaro finds this place,    he'll have a hell of a time.    Well, that's their problem.    Tiny! Buch!    Where are you guys?    Hey, have you seen my two dogs?    They're Tiny and Buch.    Shut up! Don't ask me! I'm a dog.    I can't talk.What are you stupid?    That collar!    That's Tiny's collar!    Why's his collar under the gate?    And there's blood on it!    Tiny and Buch?    Is he talking about those big dogs?    Tiny! Buch!    Hey, he better not...    He better not be thinkingabout getting under that gate?    It'll m*rder him!    Tiny! Buch! Are you there?    This isn't my problem.    I don't really careif some human kid dies.    Survival of the fittest,as they say.    The stupid die.    And so do peoplewho don't think before they act.    I don't want any trouble.    So long, kid!    Tiny! Buch! Where are you?    Come back!    It's eating my precious dogs! No!    Good grief.    I do sorta have a soft spot    for kid dog lovers!     HORUSPET SHOP    Tiny! Buch!    Damn it! Guess...    I'll have to take care of this.    The moment had finally come.    Pet Shop was onto Iggy's Stand abilities.    Bring it on, bird!I'll slaughter you!    A falcon can dive at speedsof over     kilometers per hour,    making it the fastest animalon the planet.    It rips out its prey's vital organswith razor-sharp talons,    and can preciselytarget its victims,    even at its trademark speed.    What the?Did he just smirk at me?    I thought I just saw the cornersof his beak creep up.    Birds can smile?    What the?    Something's majorly wrong.    The air, it's suddenly frigid.    Ice is coming out of the ground!    Crap!    I was too busy looking up.My feet are stuck!    My Stand's feet are stuck too!    Crap!    Icicles?    Come on, Avdol.    Do you really think that guycan find Dio's mansion?    If not, no one can.    No one knows Cairo's complex mazeof streets better than he does.    Be patient. Have faith.    You say that,    but we looked for three days,with no luck.    I don't see how finding it inthree hours is remotely possible.    You're becoming tedious, Polnareff.    Could you try to gainsome composure?    Look we're all on edge.    All we can do nowis talk to the locals.    Jeez. To top it all off,Iggy's nowhere to be seen.    Where the hell didthat stupid mutt run off to?    Iggy's a loner by nature.    I'm sure he's close by.He'll show up eventually.    Aren't dogs supposed to light upand wag their tails with glee    when they see humans?    And here we are stuckwith the little cynic.    I managed to get away.    That thing's ice took the skinright off my paws.    Damn it!    I knew I should've letthat human kid fix his own problems.    That bird's Stand is no joke.    That was no ordinary ice.    He's not showing all his cards.    I better get the hell out of here.    Talk about holding a grudge!    Iggy disappeared.    Where did he go?    Damn it!    That bastard doesn't hold back.    He's only a bird.    This place reeks,but it'll have to do for now.    I have to keep quiet and hide outdown here until he gives up.    What's up with this bird?    Hey.    Don't underestimate me.    What, you think you just k*lled    is actually my shapeshifting Stand,the Fool!    Gotcha! Bird brain!    Looks like you're losinga lot of blood there.    You might wanna keep still.    I don't give a rat's assabout you or your master Dio.    Let's just call this a draw.    You got a few good hits on mewith those ice missiles,    so we're even, okay?    What the hell?    Does he think he's Bruce Leeor something?    Hey! I said I'll stay awayfrom your boss's mansion!    Let's stop this already. Okay?    So that's whatyour Stand looks like?    You stopped the bleedingby freezing it?    Crap!    He blocked the exit with icewhen I wasn't looking!    The ice is coming this way!    sh*t!    It's starting to cover the tunnel!    I've got to get out of here!    It blocked this exit, too!    He's locked onto me!    He's insane!    He's not relentless!    He's a hunting machine!    And if he catches me,he won't just k*ll me.    He'll eat me alive!    What? My foot!    I can't get my foot out!    -Man, this is really not my day!-That stupid dog.    That birdbrain is reallypissing me off.    It wouldn't be strangeif there was a Stand user    in charge of guarding the mansion.    I'm gonna have to do this!    If I don'the's going to k*ll me!

EPISODE   : THE GUARDIAN OF HELL,PET SHOP, PART      Hey, the sun's about to set.   Three hours, my ass.   Guess that cocky beggar   never did find Dio's mansionlike he said he would.   Eh, Avdol?   I just had a disturbing thought:   I'm beginning to hopehe hasn't found the mansion.   It's very possiblehe hasn't returned   because he did find it.   Hey!   I have a sinking feelingthat a Stand user is guarding Dio's lair.   We may have put that beggar's lifein grave danger.   Ah, come on!   My leg...   The ice caught my pawlike a bear trap.   I would've been dead meatif I hadn't gnawed it off.   I'll hide here for a while.   I have to hideand get him off my tail!   The Speedwagon Foundationcan make me an artificial leg.   Now I'm pissed!Damn bird!   You're not getting away with this!   I'm gonna make you pay!Just you wait!   That sound!   Something just dove into the water!   No, it can't be!   Birds are capableof plunging into water.   Like any human or canine,a bird has lungs to breathe.   But the average bird also hassome five to six air sacs   in its chest and stomach.   The air sacs allow a bird   to fly and remain consciouswhere a human could not   at altitudesof six to seven thousand meters.   Even when strangled,   a bird can survivefor several minutes   thanks to its internal air reserves.   Which means a bird can stayunderwater much longer than a dog!   Something's diving this way!   That's impossible!   I can't believe it.   It's heading right for me!   Is it? It can't be!   It's that bird!   How can a bird survive underwater!   That bastard, where'd he go?   He's closing in!He's going to att*ck again!   More icicles. One, two, three.   Three are coming this way!   Right back at ya!   I did it. How do you like that?   The wall isn't leaking anymore.   The icicle's baseis freezing the wall!   What now?   I know what he's up to.   He's freezing the water   all around me!   And he severed my air pipes!   He's not trying to suffocate me.   He's trying to bury me alive!   It's no use.It's gonna collapse!   It's too powerful!I can't hold him off!   I'm surrounded by iceand freezing water!   Damn it!   So much for a decent hiding place!   I'm just going to haveto dig my way out.   Man, today is really not my day!   I lose my leg,   and some psychotic demon bird wantsme flattened and flash frozen!   I can't hold him off anymore.I'm going to be crushed.   I need to dig myself out, pronto!   Huh?   What's that? Some kind of cave?   It's the bird!   He's gonna sh**t an ice m*ssile!   Crap! My Stand is behind me!   There's no way I can defend myself.   Nowhere to escape!   That's it!There's no other way.   It's do or die!   I'll let the dome break   on purpose!   The air pressure will catapult me!   I did it. I finished him off.   Damn bird got what he deserved.   But I'm done for.   I've lost a ton of blood.   I don't have the strengthto swim to shore.   I'm gonna drown.   I was supposed to livea trouble-free life.   Damn it,    I goofed up.    I can't believe it!    I was passing by and saw youstruggling in the river.    That bird got you, didn't it?Just like he got my dogs.    You'll be okay.    The bird is gone.    You can't die! Hang in there!    I'll patch you right up.    "That bird": Pet Shop.    Stand: Horus.Status: Deceased.     HORUSPET SHOP    Damn that Iggy!Where the hell did he go?    He's gotta stop doing this!    I'm worried.He's been gone a while.    That stupid mutt!    What's the matter, Jotaro?    So someone is following us.    No I thought I heard a voice.Like someone calling us.    A voice?    Iggy?    Iggy!    What happened to you?    He's got injuries all over!    Hey! He's missing his front leg!    Did he get run over by a car?    He's not the kind of dogthat gets into car accidents.    You were att*cked,weren't you, Iggy?    Looks like someonetreated his wounds.    They did an incredible job.    It wasn't Iggy that I heard.    It was definitely a human.    It appears Iggy had a run-inwith the enemy.    We saw a boy holding him.He was half-dead.    The doctors from the SpeedwagonFoundation tended to his wounds.    Just like...    my eyes.    You're...    Kakyoin!    It's Kakyoin! Hey!    Kakyoin, how are your eyes?    I'm glad you're all safe.    We missed you!    Were they able to treat you?    Yes. I'm fine now.    I've got a few scars,but my eyesight is back to normal.    Thank goodness.    Jotaro.    Hey, Iggy.Where are you going now?    He may've been indifferenttoward humans and Stands before,    but it looks like he's tryingto lead us somewhere.    I don't know what happenedbetween him and the enemy Stand,    but now,I'd say it's a matter of revenge.    Just where is he taking us?    Hey, Iggy, hold on.    That car!    It's the same fancy carthat beggar was driving.    This wreckage is...    What did this?    There's a huge hole,    like some gigantic pillartore through the windshield.    It's just as I feared.    I knewwe shouldn't have asked him.    Could this be the workof the Stand user    that Iggy possibly encountered?    There seems to be little doubt.    Iggy!    Hey, what is this?    I'm in a cold sweatall of a sudden.    I feel this oppressive doom.    Where's Iggy trying to take us?    I know this feeling.    This aura of evil.    This mansion.    The one from the picture.    Iggy! You were able to find it!    What lay before them was somethingmore evil and more sinister    than anything Jotaro and the othershad encountered before.    Finally,the source of their predicament,    the very embodiment of evil,their destiny, was within grasp.    The path that had led themhere was long.    Mysterious foreign lands    and treacherous Stand-usingassassins met them at every step.    Every battle wasa struggle for survival.    And the journey touched everyone.    There were tears, and there waslaughter, sadness, and rage.    There was joy.    Nearly    days has passedsince the team left Japan    on their quest to saveJotaro's mother, Holly.    All to defeat Dio.All to end the hundred-year curse.    Joseph was determined.    He was going to savehis daughter, Holly.    And nothing was goingto get in his way.    Kakyoin remained resolute.    He would defeat Dio,    not only to save Holly,but to overcome his own weaknesses.    Avdol was steadfast.    He considered it his dutyto locate and root out evil    wherever it lurked,wherever it thrived.    Polnareff was unwavering.    He would make Dio pay.    Pay for turning him intoone of Dio's puppets.    And pay for making himgo against his own principles.    Iggy was furious.    He knew Dio, the bastard,    was why he was caught upin all this absurdity.    And he was goingto make him pay.    And...    So, in other words, if we b*atthe sh*t out of Dio in there,    it will all be over.    He's here. This scent of evil,there's no doubt    he's inside the mansion!    Which means that we...    ...have finally reachedthe end of our journey.    Are you ready?    The gate's open.    We can just walk in?    It was closed yesterday.    Just as I can sense him,he can sense us.    Entering this mansionwould be like walking into a trap.    Now...    What do we do now?    The door is opening! Stay on guard!    Hey, look at this corridor.It looks like it goes on forever.    It can't be real.    It must be some kind oftrick or illusion    Polnareff,don't go through that door.    Dio's probably got one or twoStand users left to fight us.    What the?Something's coming this way!    What is he? Is he a Stand user?    Welcome.    Master Joestar,we've been expecting you.    I am the butler of this house.    Allow me to wager    that Star Platinum's first att*ckagainst me will...    Jotaro, blast him!    Take that corner at full throttle!    If we don't defeat you,we won't be able to proceed.    Exactly! That is indeed correct.
02x40 - D'Arby the Player, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:56What the?Something's coming this way!  I don't know who you are,but you're no ordinary human!  Polnareff!  And I'm gonna end you!  A playing card?  Welcome. Master Joestar,we've been expecting you.  I am the butler of this house.  My name is D'Arby.  D'Arby?   Yes. My name is D'Arby Younger.   The D'Arby whom you defeated,   is my older brother.   You're D'Arby the gambler'syounger brother?   So you're hereto avenge your brother?   No, certainly not.I would do nothing of the sort.   Did my brother not sharewith you his motto?   "The deceived, not the deceiver,holds the blame."   It is an adageI hold dear, as well.   My brother lost.He is the wrongdoer.   I hold no grudge against you.   My brother is my brother.And I am me.   We are two different people.   My brother and Iare ten years apart.   I did look up to himto a certain extent,   but we are of different generations.   My brother tried to winby deception.   He is old-fashioned.   He could win against onlythe outmoded and the inexperienced.   Master Dio realized that as well,   which is why he kept me by his sideand made me his butler.   Is something wrong?   If you wish to fight me,   then I invite youto enter our manor.   Stay on guard, everyone!   We don't have time for games.Take us to Dio!   Jotaro! Be careful!Something's coming out of his body!   D'Arby Younger. His Stand, Atum.Atum of the Egyptian pantheon.   Hey, he brought out his Stand!   We haven't seen this in a while.   So another Standthat actually shows itself.   So who's first?   Who shall be my first opponent?   Forget that!   Jotaro, take him down!   I'll bet youStar Platinum will first att*ck   with his left arm.   His first att*ck will be a punchthrown with his left arm.   -How much do you bet?-This is bullshit!   It won't makea difference either way.   One punch is all it takes!   Do it!   Hit him, Jotaro!   What? He dodged it?   Such amazing speed!   That's impossible.   Ah, too bad.It seems I lost the bet.   Like my brother,I enjoy a good bet.   But, alas,luck is never on my side.   To apologize, I shall take youto a wonderful world.   What the? A pit?   Blast it! It was all a trap!   Jotaro!   Jotaro's falling into the abyss!   Pull him out!   I suppose I have no choice.Join us.   Mister Joestar! Kakyoin!   Wait! It's too dangerousto go in after them!   Avdol, can you hear me?   If you don't hear from usin ten minutes,   torch that mansion!   Understand, Avdol?   Mister Joestar!    EPISODE   :DARBY THE PLAYER, PART     Is this an illusion?Are we underground or above ground?   This water feels so real.   What is this?   Just what is he trying to do?   Old man, Kakyoin,see if you can figure this out.   His Stand knew without a doubtI would throw a right punch.   Have any idea why?   If we don't figure it out,we'll lose this one.   Care to wet your whistle?   The drinks are real.   And I assure youthey are not poisoned.   Are we inside the mansion?   Yes.   Where in the mansion are we?   I cannot tell you that.   -Are we in the basement?-Perhaps.   Is a Stand doing this?The illusion?   Yes.   Is it your Stand?   No.   -Is it Dio's?-No.   Whose is it?   I'd rather not say.   The Speedwagon Foundationhas reported   that there are two to three moreStand users.   Is that true?    I'd rather not say.    You're not being very helpful.    I could lie,    but unlike my brother,I prefer not to resort to trickery.    So what you're saying is    if we don't defeat you,we can't proceed?    Exactly!    Absolutely correct, my good sir.    That gentlemanly demeanoris beginning to get on my nerves.    Remember, it's three against one.    We're short on time,    so you'll have to deal withall three of us at once.    Come now, take a load off.    I have something to show you.    This is my collection.    Collection?    Like my brother,I'm a humble collector.    Every collector yearns to sharehis treasured trinkets    for that ephemeral momentof praise, does he not?    Is he a...    Dolls? But why?    No, Kakyoin.    He's D'Arby's brother.    Those aren't ordinary dolls.    D'Arby!    Talk to me. Please, talk to me.    Talk to me!    I'm so lonely!    Help me!    Oh my God!    They're alive!These dolls are alive!    You bastard! You took their souls!    My hobby is making dolls.    Course,    most doll makers cannot imbuetheir handiwork with human souls.    I suppose I may begiving too much away,    but that is my Stand's ability.    My brother's collectionis rather boring.    All he has are simple coinsmade of souls.    With my collection,you can play dress up    and have actual conversations.    -Meet Sonia.-D'Arby!    She can wax poeticabout her many passionate love stories.    She has such exquisite skin,doesn't she?    Anyone would be proud to own her.    Dr. Elliott is a serial k*ller.He's k*lled eight people.    He'll tell you all aboutthe patients he's exterminated.    I made the glassesand stethoscope myself.    Oh, and how could I forget!I must show you this!    This is Tatsuhiko,a video game expert from Japan!    He was a formidable opponentwith an IQ of    .    It wasn't easy b*ating himand stealing his soul, though.    You're just as sickas your brother.    No, you're even more sadistic.    I'm losing all patience!    Beneath that polite faÃ§adeis a deranged sociopath.    You make me sick.    By the way,I'm sure you learned this    when you fought my brother,    but the human soulis a mysterious thing indeed.    The moment a person admits defeat,    the soul losesalmost all its vitality.    At that very moment,I can rip out a person's soul!    That is our Stands'fundamental mechanism.    I've heard enough!No more Mr. Nice Guy!    We'll knock the living daylightsout of you,    and get the hell on our way!    But you must listen!    Jotaro! You already knowyou're under my control.    Remember, Jotaro,when you tried to att*ck me,    and I knew exactly which armyou would use.    Shocking, wasn't it?    You still haven't figured it out!    You were shaken,and while only slightly,    I was able to touch your soul.    What do you think I didwhen I touched your soul?    What?    What is that?    I embedded Atum's handinside your soul.    I could crush your right armand make Master Dio very happy.    But if I did that,    I wouldn't be able to defend myselfagainst Kakyoin and Joseph,    and I would perish.    I certainly don't want that.    So I have a suggestion, gentlemen.    Let's play a gameand bet our souls.    What?    If you b*at me,I will let go of your arm.    Good grief.Already under your control, huh?    You're going to regret this, D'Arby.    I would love to hear youutter the words,    "I'll bet my soul on this game."    And I have another humble request    Kakyoin, you shall bemy first opponent.    Hey, what do you mean?    You should fight me first.    Mr. Joestar and you are family,but Kakyoin is not.    I'd prefer Kakyoin not back outand att*ck me with his Stand    after I've taken both your souls.    Damn, arrogant prick.    assh*le thinks he's won already.    Fine. I'll be your opponent.    -What?-Kakyoin!    It's fine. I'm not worried.    I've probably played morevideo games than anyone here.    I challenge you to F-Mega.    I'll bet my soul!    Good.    Kakyoin!    You don't have to go first.    Yes, I do.    The hand in your arm could hinderyour game-playing ability.    D'Arby,    how do I knowyou'll release Jotaro if you lose?    The TV, console,and game cartridges are all good.    It's an ordinary video game setup.    I am not like my brother.I do not cheat.    Now, let's begin.    Yes.    Go ahead, and select your vehicle.    Right.    So, I see you picked #  .    I will be #  .My birthday is January  th.    We can begin whenever you please.    Cut the courtesy and start!    Race start in...    Five!    He's button mashing the acceleratorat such an incredible speed    He's trying for a turbo start!    Three!    -Damn! I don't have time...-Two!    ...to do the same!    He'll take the lead!    One.    Start!    He blocked me!    As long as I'm in fronthe can't b*at me.    It's impossible for him to pass.    And unfortunately for you,    I never make mistakesduring a race.    It's over, Kakyoin!    What?    Kakyoin, you've playedthis game before, haven't you.    I'd rather not say.    All right!This is your chance, Kakyoin!    Hurry up! Get your machineback on course and start!    That technique...    You don't get these skillssimply by playing video games.    I never guessedhe'd make such a bold move.    They're tied! They're side by side!    No. Kakyoin is on the outside.    He's at a disadvantageon the turns.        kilometers per hour,    ,    .    Three seconds till the first turn!    I can't turn at this speed!    I'm entering the turnat full speed!    Two! One!    They're synchronized!    They turned at the same speedat the same time!    They're neck and neck!    I like you, Kakyoin!    Your soul is on the line,but you're unflinching!    You've conquered your fear!    You will make a worthy additionto my collection.    Noriaki Kakyoin thought to himself...    Conquered my fears?    Thank you.I haven't always been this way.    Six months ago,when I met your master, Dio,    he planted a flesh bud in my brain,    and I was terrified.    I still remember.    I remember the horrorof facing that monster.    My legs wouldn't move.Every hair on my body stood on end.    I was frozen.    I realized I was helpless.    The mere sight of him was turningmy own body against itself.    My stomach was in knots.    I could taste bilein the back of my throat.    I nearly threw up.    Dio gazed down at me,    and said tenderly,as if calming a child...    Kakyoin.    There's nothing to fear.    Let's be friends.    I curse myself! I heard his words.    And I was relieved.    Totally and utterly relieved.    "I can still live!", I thought.    But it was humiliating.I'll never forgive him!    It was humiliating beyond words.    I'll never forgive myself.    I curse myselffor submitting to him.    Jotaro saved me.    That's why I decidedto embark on this journey.    I will never againallow myself to become    the pathetic, cowardly KakyoinI was on that fateful day!    And that, D'Arby, is why I can fightwith my very soul on the line!    Three, two, one!    They're neck and neck again!    The third corner!    That is why I, Noriaki Kakyoin,    will never be controlledby my fears.    That, I promise you!    All right! The fifth corner!In sync again!    They're both turningat the same speed!    Kakyoin! Damn you!    The sixth corner is coming up!    The speed tunnelcomes right after the sixth turn.    If you enter the tunnel,    you can doubleyour max speed to    km.    I've got to make it to the tunnel!    The tunnel is wide enoughfor only one car.    If they try to enter the tunnelside by side,    one of them is going to crash!    Sixth turn!They're still neck and neck!    The tunnel! I see the tunnel.    Kakyoin, push'm aside!    Haven't you realized, Kakyoin?    Do you really thinkyou can push me aside?    Look at your power meter!    Kakyoin has less power!    You used up your power    when you spun aroundand blocked me    back at the beginning of the race!    Two seconds untilwe reach the tunnel.    You're going to crash!Let him have the lead!    Go in the tunnel behind D'Arby!    I can't do that!    If he makes it to the tunnel first,there's no way I can win.    One second!    Kakyoin!    He went on two wheels!    Dammit!You're riding the tunnel walls.    Yes, Kakyoin! You can do it!    Push'm aside!    Quiet! You're ruiningmy concentration!    He's slamming into Kakyoin!    I don't care if I lose some power.    I need to get around that turnfaster than Kakyoin,    even if it's only a hundredthof a second sooner.    I need to get out of the tunnelbefore him, even if it means    I'm just one one-thousandthof a millimeter ahead!    Hey, what's wrong?I can't see the cars!    From here on, we have to get throughthe tunnel in darkness.    What?    Absolute darkness,where the radar is completely useless!    And there are eight turns,a landmine, and a cannon att*ck.    It remains darkuntil you're out of the tunnel.    One mistakeand you'll slam into the wall.    But I know exactlywhere the turns are.    And I'm sure D'Arby does too.    That's the cars turning.    What's happening? Where are they?    Who's ahead?    Three!    Two!    One!    Cannon att*ck!    For a second there,the blast lit up the cars!    Kakyoin is slightly behind.    The exit!They're about to exit the tunnel!     D'Arby is ahead!    He's one car length ahead!    I win!    I will never let down my guard.    You have less power than I!    I've grasped his soul!    Don't be ridiculous, Jotaro!    I know the rules of baseball.    It is impossible to back out now!    You should offer encouragementat times like this.    This is pathetic.
02x41 - D'Arby the Player, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:57They're about to exit the tunnel!  Oh! D'Arby is ahead!  He's one car length ahead!  Now our speed will double.  I win!  No!  I still have more powerthan you, D'Arby!  Which means...  Kakyoin's car just...   He spun and knockedD'Arby's car off the race track!   He was going     kilometers per hour!   He's out!   Kakyoin's car is safe on the ground.   He did it!   The car with less power losesin collisions.   Forfeiting your powerto ram me was a mistake.   You didn't realize that I intentionallystayed one car length behind   so I could spinand knock you off course.   Is that so?   Seems you're the onewho's missed something.   Losing power was not an accident.   I planned it so you would knockmy car off course!   Everything restson this one moment!   Look where my car is going now!   What?   He landed on the opposite sideof the track, farther ahead!   I don't believe it!   Yes, normally, it's impossible.   Normally, an attempt to make itto the opposite track   by hurdling overthe curve would result   in an abrupt collision with terra firma,even at     kilometers per hour.   You can't make it by jumpingover the curves.   But Kakyoin, it's another storyif you're catapulted over them.   All I needed was your help!   I sacrificed my powerso you would hit me.   It was all part of my plan.   Now, then,   Shall we proceedwith our race, Kakyoin?   Don't give up, Kakyoin!   Kakyoin!   There, his soul is mine.   He admitted defeat.   He knew it was pointlessto continue racing.   I must say Kakyoin,   you are the first opponentto ever make me perspire.   This Kakyoin doll will make a mostexquisite addition to my collection.   He was my first opponentto conquer his fears   and not cr*ck under pressure.   Kakyoin!   I will treasure himand his good company.   Careful.   I advise you to remain calmand not to att*ck me.   And that's not all.   I could slip on a banana peeland hit my head,   choke on a piece of gum,or suffer a heart att*ck   and die from something as simpleas someone popping a bag of popcorn.   Kakyoin's soul would go straightto heaven with me.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE PLAYER, PART     -Jotaro?-Oh?   Hey, Jotaro!Why are you sitting down?   I'll b*at him! I'm next!   Old man, have you even playedany of these games?   Stay out of this, old man.   We're not playing cardsor hanafuda here.   We're playing baseball next.   That's how we'll do this.   I bet my soul.   Good. I bet Kakyoin's soul.   There. My Stand, Atum,has released your arm.   Now that I have Kakyoin's soul,   there's no reason for me to keepmy Stand's hand on you.   And I'd be at a bit of a disadvantage   if I faced youwith my Stand one-handed.   I know your Star Platinumis swift and precise.   Of all the gamesyou could have chosen...   This one is my specialty.   D'Arby! The minute Jotaro beats you,I'll throttle you.   Don't forget that.   This game hasn't been tamperedwith either.   I'm certain.   First, pick your team.   Jaguars.   I see.   You selected a strong offensive team.   You have two batters with overa .    batting average.   Then I'll choose the Red Dragons.   Offense or defense?Take your pick.   Offense.   Fine. Jaguars will bat first.   You can design your own playersby drawing their faces.   This is Star Platinum.   Done.   Now, shall we play ball?   Jaguars versus Red Dragons.   Play ball!   TOP OF THE FIRST   I've chosen number    as my pitcher.   January  th is my birthday,you know.   Here we go.    The pitcher is winding up.    The first pitch!    What?    Strike one!    Hey, Jotaro.What did you just do?    You swung the bat before the pitchereven threw the ball!    Hey, Jotaro...    What are you practicingyour swing for?    No...    Is this the first timeyou've played this game?    Have you even playedvideo games before?    Answer me, Jotaro!    Relax. I know how to play baseball.    I'll figure outthe game's controls as I go.    What?    Your timing is totally off!    Your swings are pathetic!    This is your first time playing,isn't it?    Strike two!    Now you swung the bat afterthe catcher caught the ball!    You have no clue what you're doing!    Dammit, Jotaro!    You've never playeda video game before, have you?    Strike! Batter out!    Quit messing around, Jotaro!    Stop trying to act so cool!    You bet your soul!There's no backing out!    Good grief.    This is when you're supposedto cheer for me.    Like "It's only the first inning.The game's just started.    You can do it, Jotaro." Like that.    What are you thinking?    Star Platinum's reflexes mean nothing    if you don't know the first thingabout video games.    Do you honestly think you can b*at him?What's your plan, Jotaro?    What's going onin that head of yours?    Jotaro.    If you're trying to trick meby pretending to be an amateur,    it's not going to work.    I'd never let my guard down,not even against a child!    I've bet a soul,and I will not hold back.    Old man.    I have no plan.    My only "plan" is to knock    the nose straight off the condescending,over-inflated douchebag    taking up space beside me.    All I care about is gettingKakyoin's soul back.    Say what you'd like.    It's still the top of the first inning,and you have one out.    There's still more game to play.    And remember,    if you fall more thaneleven points behind,    you lose.    Second batter, number three.    Strike!    He's getting worse!    He was over    centimeters abovethe ball when he swung!    Strike two!    Not even close!    Strike three! You're out!    It's all over.    He's no competition for him.    It's like the high schoolbaseball champs    going against the tea ceremony club.    It's pathetic.    Strike!    Strike two!    It looks like he really is a beginner.This is too easy!    In the same waythat a judo pro can gauge    his opponent's skill simply by lookingat the way he wears his gi,    I can tellJotaro is a complete video game novice!    But I will never let my guard down.    I know every batter's weaknessin this game.    Next will be a low pitchto the outside.    I'll throw my best pitch,the four-seam fast ball,    and strike him out!    First inning, two outs,two strikes, no fouls.    Here comes my next pitch.    Go ahead.    I pretty much got the hangof batting now.    What did he just say?    "Got the hang of it"?    What?    He can't have...    What is he talking about?    What does he mean?    What?    Jotaro!    Good. This game is pretty fun.    Huh? It can't be...    It's going. The ball is still going!    What did he say just now?    He just "got the hangof batting now"?    Got the hang of it?    It's good!    You've got to be kidding me!No way!    Home run!    A home run!    Jotaro!    What did you just say?    "I got the hang of it"?    Did you really say,"I pretty much got the hang of batting"?    I'm not going to say it again.    He was a beginner.    He learned how to swingwith just eight pitches?    Jotaro Kujo has all the speedand dexterity of Star Platinum.    Now I know why Master Diofinds him to be problematic.    Now I know why my brother lost.    Interesting. I couldn't have askedfor a more fitting opponent.    But revealing your talentsso early in the game,    that, my friend, is a mistakeyou will regret.    The game continues, Jotaro.    He did it!    He did it again!    Another home run!    You scored four runsin the first inning!    Looks like you've got this gamein the bag, Jotaro!    Keep it up! Keep going!    Hey, D'Arby.    I know you'll turna deaf ear to me,    but I'll say it anywaycause I'm a nice guy.    If you return Kakyoin's souland take us to Dio,    we'll spare your life.    My brother was a master gamblerand a genius con artist.    Yet he never said,    "Terrence, let's playa game of poker."    Not even once.    Why do you think that is?    When I was fifteen, I caught my brothermaking a move on my girlfriend.    He was ten years older than me,and I b*at him to a bloody pulp.    I broke his ribs and kicked himuntil he vomited blood.    The last thing he eversaid to me was, "I'm sorry."    Do you know why?    Cut to the chase, bastard!    Ever since we were kids,    my brother knewhe could never b*at me.    And there's a reason for that.    Right now, you may appear confident,hitting home run after home run.    But you feel a sense of unease,    just like my brotherdid all those years ago.    My prowess worries you, doesn't it?    You're thinking,"No... Maybe... It can't be..."    Right, Jotaro?    What are you talking about?    I'm changing pitchers!    Number    is out.Number    is in.    Number    is a power pitcher witha maximum pitch speed of     km/h.    I'll also tell you my pitch.    Number    will throw a forkballright down the middle!    What? He's declaringwhat he's throwing?    A forkball right down the middle.    Do you believe me or not?    Jotaro, he's just trying to shakeyour confidence.    Just ignore him!    Throw the ball, D'Arby.    To believe or not to believe?    It's coming right at him!    It's a fastball!    Is it going to change direction?    What's going to happen?    He swung!Jotaro bet on the forkball!    But it's not changing direction!It's a fastball!    He hit the bottom of the ball!    Out!    First inning!Three outs! Change!    FIRST INNING    You idiot!    You fell for it?You swung for a forkball!    No.    He already knew I would swingfor a forkball.    He knew before he threw the ball,so he switched to a fastball.    And he's right.    I've been worried ever sincewe stepped foot into this mansion.    He somehow knew that Star Platinumwould throw a left punch.    That's impossible!    Are you trying to tell mehe can read your mind?    It's my turn at bat.    This will be a home run.    I'll hit a home run right intothe left-field bleachers.    Old man.    You're sure the gameand console are good, right?    I'm positive.    And I haven't seen him makeany funny moves either.    Then the secret is his Stand.    His Stand doesn't just take souls.    He has another ability.    I'm going to aim for...    Now I'll get to the bottom of this.    What? He's going to try to hitthe batter on purpose?    Where might you be aiming now?An inside pitch?    Will you throw it high?    Or low?    Are you planning some sort of trick?    What? He pulled back the secondJotaro threw the ball!    He knew exactlywhat was going to happen!    There's no wayhe could have done that    without reading Jotaro's mind.    Home run!    That's one run.    Damn.    We've faced all kinds of opponents,but never one who could read our minds.    If he can really read our minds,    then it doesn't matter how smartor strong we think we are.    We don't stand a chance!    Jotaro, what are you going to do?    BOTTOM OF THE FIRST    Damn it! He's declaringanother home run.    Let's see.Will it be an outside pitch?    Or are you going to aim low?    Perhaps a fastball?    Four to two.    A person's body languageand the surrounding environment    can sometimes help predictan opponent's next move.    But never perfectly.    His Stand predicts Jotaro's pitchwith    % accuracy.    And technically he's not cheating!    Another home run!It's four to three!    How do we stop himfrom reading our minds?    How?    I'll be in the lead in no time.    Now, will your next movebe an inside pitch?    A fastball? A high pitch?Perhaps a curveball?    Oh, what do youhave up your sleeve?    Your hat...    Heh, you fool.     Do you honestly thinkI'd cheat like my brother?    Jotaro, that's not it!    Hiding your facewith your hat won't help.    He's not watching the reflectionof the screen in your eyes.    There's no way he can seewhat you're pressing    or what pitch you're choosing.    I've been watching him.That's not what's going on.    I'm sweating.    That's why I took it off.    Please hurry upand throw your next pitch.    But I won't besweating anymore.    I'll tell you my next pitch.    I'm throwinga high, outside fastball.    What?    What?What did you just say, Jotaro?    Just as I said.    Losing your hearing, old man?    I just told him my next pitch.    I'm going to throw a high,outside fastball.    Jotaro!    To believe?Or not to believe?     Not too bright, are you?    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    What did you just say, Jotaro?    I said I was going to declare my pitch.    -Jotaro is not lying.-Yes.    -You rigged the console somehow!-No.    Your school hat provesthat you're cheating!    It's not cheatingif you don't get caught.

Losing your hearing, old man?  I just told him my next pitch.  I'm going to throwa high, outside fastball.  Jotaro!  To believe?Or not to believe?  Not too bright, are you?  My Stand can peer intoyour soul in the same way   that a thermal imager detectsan object's radiation.   It doesn't matter what Jotaro may say,his soul cannot lie.   Yes or no? Right or left?   By analyzing your soul, I can seethe answer to any yes-or-no question.   Outside or inside? High or low?   Fastball or curveball?   My Stand is infallible.    A high, outside fastball?    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART      Yes or no?   Jotaro is telling the truth.   He's going to pitcha high, outside fastball.   This is no ruse.   What is he up to?   He b*at my brother by bluffing,   but he thinksthat will work with me?   You fool!   Here it comes.   Don't forget, you loseif you fall eleven runs behind.   What? A curve!   That wasn't a high,outside fastball!   And he hit it!   But it's a grounder!Throw to first! He's out!   I don't believe it.   There was no way he wasn't throwinga high, outside fastball.   No one's soul can lie.Not even the great Buddha's.   Not even my brother's,the world's greatest con man!   Next is another high, outside fastball.   He's not lying. He's serious!   Jotaro, you don't intend to have mebelieve you're cheating right now, do you?   I do!   What?   He's cheating?   A low, inside forkball!   Fly ball! The pitcher caught it!   Out!   You cheated!Jotaro, you bastard!   You must've tamperedwith the console!   What?   So he didn't tamper with it?   I know you're cheating!   Now come clean!   No response.   Damn! I have to aska yes-or-no question!   Looks like you can readmy thoughts   only when it's a yes-or-no question.   Like your brother used to say,   it's not cheatingif you aren't caught.   It's not cheatingif you aren't caught?   How dare you?   Do you knowwho you're talking to?   Go ahead and pitch, Jotaro!   I'll figure out your trickand take your soul!   Now, then.Shall we continue?   My next pitch will be...   A high, outside fastball.   Jotaro's soul isn't lying.   He is genuinely goingto pitch a high, outside fastball.   I'll figure outhow you're cheating!   This ends now!   He hasn't changed his mind.   It's still a "yes."He's going to throw it!   Here it comes!   It's still a "yes."He threw a fastball!   It tumbled! A forkball!   What? It's a different pitch!   Out! That's three outs! Change!   I don't get it! I can't figure outhow he's cheating?   Jotaro's soul kept sayinghe'd throw a fastball,   but it curved!   How is he deceiving me?   You're done for, D'Arby.   Shut up!   It's the hat!Why did you take off your hat?   You've been cheatingever since you took that hat off!   Move! I'm checkingyour station and controller.   Damn you!How did you do it?   I don't suppose, it has somethingto do with that hat,   does it?   The culprit is somewherearound here!   You're using Star Platinumto cheat, aren't you?   You're doing something, Jotaro!Admit it!   Damn it!   I can read people's minds!   And I can read Jotaro's thoughts!   How does his mind throwthe ball one way,   but his body throws it another?   He, uh... looks like he's losinghis youthful glow.   He definitely doesn't look likea guy in his twenties anymore.   D'Arby, it's your turn.    Hurry up and throw it.    Four to three...    Only a one-point difference.I can b*at him.    I am a video game genius!    I cannot lose.    I am a video game genius!    I cannot lose.My mind is a steel trap.    I've won every match!I'm invincible!    A video game expertis an expert at life!    You thinkyou can shake my confidence?    It's in! It's a home run!    Another run for the Jaguars!    It's five to three!    No! I inadvertentlyreleased his soul!    Kakyoin's soul just...He's conscious!    No! I didn't admit defeat!    It was an accident!Releasing his soul was a mistake!    If you released his soul,then that means...    your soul admitted defeat.    What?    Joseph's Stand,he entwined it around the controller.    Oh, whoops.    Something so idiotic...    The cheat was...The one manipulating the controller...    Damn it...    So Jotaro wasn't controlling it.It was you, Joseph Joestar!    That's right, D'Arby.    I'm sure your brother would havefigured it out a long time ago.    By the way, old man.    I'm glad you caught on to my secret idea.    Of course! I know exactlywhat you're thinking!    You're my grandson!    Come on, Kakyoin.    Damn it... From behind...    Now...    What to do with you?    You have to forgive me!I gave you Kakyoin's soul back!    Everything's back to normal now!    We're good! Right?    If you want to knowwhether I'll forgive you,    why don't you just read my mind?    Tell me, will I hit youwith my right fist or my left?    Guess.    Just get it over with.You'll use your right.    Your left?    Both?    Are you going to dothe "ora-ora" thing?    Yes! Oh my God!    D'Arby Younger: Out of commission!    Looks like we broke throughsome sort of wall.    That's our ticket out of here,Jotaro! Kakyoin!    Good grief.    Forgive me for disturbing you, master,    but as I'm sure you arealready aware,    about ten minutes ago,    Joestar and his comradesinfiltrated the manor.    I must also inform youthat D'Arby has been defeated.    D'Arby was a genius.    With such competence and acumen,D'Arby should have won.    Why do you thinkhe suffered defeat?    Come in, Cool Ice.    As you wish.    The Joestars    are unconditionally preparedto sacrifice their own lives    in order to save their family.    Kakyoin and the other two...    What were their names...    Ah, yes...    Avdol and Polnareff are willingto die to destroy me.    They believe running from mewould mean running from themselves.    Such fools.    But that is their strength.    D'Arby may have swornhis loyalty to me,    but he was not preparedto die on my behalf.    That is why, at the edge of glory,he could not clinch victory.    For all eternity,D'Arby will remain in ignorance.    Ice...    Look at the scar on my neck.    Jonathan Joestar's bodyis still rejecting me.    But all it takes is the bloodof one more soul.    The body will become mine,and the wound will heal.    Ice...    Will you give me your life's blood?    Yes, master. With pleasure.    What is mine is yours!    You beheaded yourself.    Most splendid.    But Cool Ice,    I cannot accept the bloodof such a loyal servant.    I shall heal my woundwith another's blood.    You must live.    To your rebirth.    Your resolve shall secureyour victory.    Dio, my lord.    One's own body is always best.    You are ready.    Take care of them, Cool Ice.    Lord Dio...    I will not let you down.    I promise, I shall destroyevery one of them.    You need not helpwith the door.    Your Stand can completely vanishfrom this dimension.     COOL ICE    The ten minutes are up.    Mister Joestar said to setthe mansion ablaze,    but I say we go in after them.    Yeah.    Before we proceed, there's somethingI have to tell you, Polnareff.    If you lose your way or are injuredand can't go on,    I will not save you.    Iggy, the same goes for you.    I know it sounds cruel,    but we've come here to defeat Dio.    If I become injuredor separated from you,    promise me you won't attemptto save me either.    You must think of your own safetyfirst and foremost.    We can't let ourselves get k*lledtrying to save one another.    Yeah, I got it, Avdol.    If we get out of here alive,    you'd better treat meto a mind-blowing feast of a dinner.    I'll treat you and Iggy, both.    All right, let's go.    Silver Chariot!    Hey, Avdol. What should we do?    It looks like it goes on forever.    I know Mister Joestar told usto set the mansion on fire,    but this structure isan immense labyrinth.    Setting it alight would put us allin grave danger.    Instead...    Magician's Red!    The flames detect lifeforms.    They will sense anything that breathes,human or animal.    They can even detect cutaneous respirationand minute movements.    They will also sense a Stand's energy.    The flames will lead the way.    Why are there six flames?    There is a flame for each ofthe four directions,    as well as ones for the spaceabove and below us.    If something is hiddenwithin fifteen meters,    regardless of size,the flames will detect its presence.    Mister Joestar and the otherswere pulled below us.    Let's head down.    The flames alreadypicked up something.    There's something in front of us,to the left.    What?    The Fool!    Hey. Who is this guy?    -Look around us, Polnareff!-Huh?    The maze! It's gone!    His Stand created this illusion.    When Iggy slashed him, it vanished.    His name, Billie Jean.Defeated without resistance!    The mansion is back to normal.    For now, at least,the flames aren't detecting anything.    HE WHO READS THIS CARVINGAND TURNS ABACK SHALL...    HE WHO READS THIS CARVINGAND TURNS ABACK SHALL...     PERISH    The flames don't sense anything.    Iggy hasn't picked upanything, either.    What is this thing?    Impossible! My flamesand Iggy's nose didn't sense it!    Where did it come from?    Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!    Hey, Avdol! Where are you?    What was that just now?    Whose arms are those?    Hey, Avdol!    Where are you?    Avdol!    Where are you?    Avdol!    Avdol!    What the hell is that?    Where did it come from?    Why didn't Avdol's flames sense it?    Hey, Iggy!    You couldn't smell himwith your nose?    Answer me!    Where are you, Avdol?    Where did you go?    Avdol...    has been disintegrated.He is dead.    Beyond my jaws liesan endless void.    A dark dimension unto whichmy own understanding reaches not.    Your ally is already gone.    You two are next.    Your arrogance will not last.    One by one, each in his place,    I shall strew your atomic fragmentsacross the void.    I don't believe you.    It's impossible.    Avdol can't be dead.    You lie!    -Is fate telling me to live on?-I heard another wall fall down.    -More sounds of destruction?-He's full of spite.    I will eliminate you.    Don't let his spite overcome you!    -There's no time to deal with the pain.-Suck on my sword and die!

And at such distances? Astonishing.   Look over here,you good-for-nothing maggot!    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART      What was that?    When we broke through the mirage,   I think I heard a wall collapsedeep in the mansion.   Do you think Avdol and Polnareff...   Damn it! I know I hit him,but he's not dead.   He cannibalized himselfinto the abyss.   He and his Stand!   Avdol... Damn it.   You said it yourself.   Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!   You told us to look outfor ourselves.   You said you wouldn't save me.   You liar!   You've been meddlingin other people's business   ever since we set foot in India!   Avdol! Why couldn't youjust leave me alone?   If I hadn't ducked just now,I'd be a dead man.   It's fate;something's telling me to carry on.   Avdol must be telling meto fight back.   This room is way too dangerous.   We've got to get out of here, Iggy!   Come on, Iggy! Upstairs!   We're going upstairs!   The exit!That's the door we came in!   But I can't leave.   Avdol sacrificed himselfto save us.   Because he believed in us,that we can defeat Dio.   I can't... I won't let him down!   I refuse to turn backlike some coward.   I'm not running away.   I'm running to get closer to Dio!   And these stairs aren'tgoing to slow me down!   I expected himto dash out the door.   Such a pity...   Impressive. He managed a hit.   Polnareff's mental fortitudeemboldens him   to conquer his own fearsand face immanent death.   I shall corner himand obliterate his body.   There is no question.   He is no match for my Stand.   His Stand's jaws are the gatewayto an alternate dimension?   A dark, unimaginable abyss...   All I know is that he can move aboutour realm without making a sound,   without leaving the faintestscent or sign of life.   But how...   How can I b*at him?   He cut us off!   He's close.   He's here!   Iggy, watch my back!   I'll watch yours.   He can't reach usif he can't break through the wall.   As long as he emergesfrom the dark beyond,   I can k*ll him.   Come at me, bastard!I'll slice you in two!   You've got me pissed, which makesmy Chariot all the faster!   I've lost Avdol,and I'm not letting you get away!   What? He's hiding in the cr*ckunder my foot?   Chariot!   My foot!   That was so...   you can't run away!   Bastard!   Not so fast.   Mister Joestar!It's that shaking again!   It has to be Avdol and Polnareff.   They've come in after us,and they're fighting somewhere.   Come on!We have to find them, fast!   You've managedto hide amid the chaos, Polnareff.   Such futility.   With that injury, you won't go far.   You must be hidingbeneath the rubble.   You are helpless against me.You shall die by my hand.   Now, where are you, Polnareff?   That's quite the ruckus, Cool Ice.   Lord Dio!   Take heed, my lord!   Polnareff and that mongrelare hiding nearby.   Allow me to be of assistance.   You must not trouble yourself.   A fake Dio made from The Fool!We got him!   Attacking from behindmight be cowardly.    You'd think I'd feel guilty.    But you k*lled Avdol from behind.    I'll show you no mercy!    This is the death you deserve!    Do it, Iggy!    Quarter the bastard,shoulder to hip!    Fillet that scoundrel!    You're kidding!He figured it out!    The sun enters this room.    Lord Dio would never...    enter this room by day.    Iggy!    The real Lord Diobestowed me with his trust.    He entrusted mewith the honor of k*lling you.    That is why Lord Dio would never descendto the second floor!    No! He's going to k*ll Iggy!    He'll be swallowed upinto the abyss!    You damn, pathetic dog!    How dare you force meto destroy Lord Dio's likeness?    What? He punched him!    He didn't use the void!    He punched Iggywithout k*lling him!    Do you have any idea...    I don't care if it was a fakemade of sand!    You made me destroy it!    I'll kick you to death,you filthy mutt!    It would take only an instantto absorb you into my dark abyss!    That won't satiate my fury!    It's your fault!    It's your faultfor making me angry!    It's your fault!    Time to learn your lesson!How's that?    I'll teach you!And this? Better?    Stop...    Cool Ice is crazy.    He's insane!    He's lost it becausehe destroyed that pile of sand    that looked like Dio?    His soul is the murky abyss!    His soul is the inky hellthat obliterates all!    Lord Dio said    the resolve of the human heartmust never be underestimated.    But you're just a filthy stray!    You have no resolve.    Your soul knowsnothing of pride!    Stop...    Take that! And that!    Stop...    How do you like that? And that?    Stop it, Cool Ice!    I will end this, Polnareff!    sh*t!    He disappeared!    But...    Iggy!    Our Stand decoymay've fallen through,    but your sandmight've just saved us.    Now I know how to find him!    I can see him.I can see him moving!    How do you like that! We did it!    Damn you!    When you move,    you have to absorbeverything in your path.    So swallow this!    Take a big mouthful of sandand come here, you piece of sh*t!    And when you peek outfrom behind your Stand's putrid teeth,    I'll finish you off!    Bull's-eye! Yeah!Eat that!    I found your weakness, Cool Ice!    Your attempt to pinpoint my locationleaves you vulnerable!    You can't see me without emergingfrom your dark dimension!    Suck on this!    Suck on my sword and croak, bastard!    You bastard...    I've skewered your throatand your brain stem!    Die, damn it!You're supposed to be dead!    Hurry up and die!    Die, Cool Ice!    I cannot die.    I do not have time to feel pain.    I will k*ll you without fail!    I will swallow Iggy,the Joestars, and anyone left!    I can die after that!    You bastard!    Good boy.You've withdrawn your sword.    This time, I'll send you to hell!    Is this the vile armthat stabbed me?    You bastard!    Damn it! I had no choicebut to shove him away!    No!    Not so fast, buddy!    I got him! But...    Damn it! He got my leg.I can't move.    But I can't think about the pain!    I almost got him!    This guy is different.    He's vengeful to the core.    And he's not just nuts.    He's consumedwith devotion to Dio!    I won't let him get the upper hand!    I can't die until I k*ll you!    Damn him! Here he comes!    Take this!    It's no use.It got part of my sword!    It's impossible to att*ck himwhen he's hidden in the abyss.    It'll just swallow me whole.    He's absorbing the buildingat random! Damn it!    The bastard knows I'll att*ck himif he shows himself.    So he's blindly attackingfrom every angle!    He's good.    At this rate,he'll hit me for sure.    I have to pull back Chariot.    Damn it...Iggy's losing too much blood.    His broken ribsmust've punctured his lungs.    Talk about insane...He's devouring the walls.    No... I was wrong!    This isn't random.It's all part of his plan!    He's drawing circles around me,smaller, concentric circles!    He's making a spiral.    Like a giant mosquito coil.He's closing in!    It doesn't matterif he doesn't know our location.    He doesn't haveto break out of the abyss.    He'll hit us anyway!    He's got usright where he wants us.    There's no wayI can dodge him with this leg!    I've got to carve an openingin the floor to get away!    Damn.I don't have enough time!    He's coming right for us!    Somehow I dodged...    But he's closing inlike a needle on a record.    In about five more rounds,he'll be here!    The question is...    How do I dodgewith this injured leg?     SELECT THE BEST ANSWERFROM THE FOLLOWING THREE OPTIONS:      . THE HANDSOME POLNAREFF WILL DEVISE     THE PERFECT COUNTERATTACKJUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.      . HIS FRIENDS WILLCOME AND SAVE HIM.      . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DODGE THE att*ck.LIFE IS A BITCH.    If it were up to me,option two would become my reality.    But I can't count on that.    They entered the mansionten minutes before us.    There's no waythey'll just appear out of thin air    like some American comic book hero,swooping in to save the day.    For all I know, they might bein the middle of a fight themselves.    Looks like option oneis my only choice.    Chariot! Pull me out of the circleas fast as you can!    Damn it! Pull me faster!    It's no use!    Damn! So it's option three.    Life is a bitch.    Silver Chariot is a Standthat fights with a saber.    It doesn't have the powerto pull my weight,    especially when I'm injured.    Blast it...    You're all torn up!Just stay still, stupid!    If you moveor use your Stand's power,    your broken ribs will sink deeperinto your lungs and you'll die!    Just cut out the tough-guy act,you idiot!    Are you trying to die beside me?    I'm the onewho's going to save you!    You have to live on    to tell Mister Joestar and the othersabout this bastard.    You have to defeat him!    Avdol might've saved me,but you sure as hell better not!    If we all die,everything will be in vain!    One more loop and he's got me.    So it is number three.    Life is cruel.    Guess he wanted victorymore than I did.    So long, Iggy.    This blood is not your doing.    It is Avdol's.    I don't know the details.    I have really bad luckwith friends.    Not to the likes of you!    It happens every time.
02x44 - The Miasma of the Void, Vanilla Ice, Part 3 / The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 3QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:58What the...This carnage...  It's perfectly spherical, like someonepulled a cork out of the wall.  What in God's name...  It's not just here. The destructionspreads into the other room.  There's no question.  Avdol and the othershave had a brush with evil!  Jotaro! Break down this door!We're going in!  Yes.  So long, Iggy.    EPISODE   : THE MIASMA OF THE VOID,COOL ICE, PART     Polnareff. The blood that stainsmy body is not your handiwork.   It is Avdol's.   My plan was to simultaneouslyeradicate you both,   but Avdol pushed youout of harm's way.   Anyone else would haveinstinctively saved himself.   He is the one responsiblefor my injuries.   I may be injured,but I am far from death.   Now I shall k*ll the other three!   They will not survive,I assure you.   Dammit, Iggy.I told you not to use your Stand.   You had to show off...   I told you not to do it.   Polnareff!   To Cool Ice, he was a filthy stray.A soul without resolve.   A soul that knew no pride.   But a Stand is a manifestationof the soul.   Iggy's soul actedof its own volition.   Something had compelled it to action.   The sand... I can feel it.But it's a Stand...   How could this have happened?Damn it!   It's a lifeless remnant.A vestige of a Stand...   I feel the chill of death.A life cut short.   Damn!Why am I the one who survived?   Ig...   Iggy!   You're slow, Cool Ice.And it's as you say.   Life is cruel.My friends have all left me.   I was supposed to save Iggy,but instead, he saved me.   Damn it!   How could this be happening?   I only now realizewhat he meant to me.   It always happens this way.   It's always after they're gone.   You may've beena miserable little mutt,   but you always impressed me.You were stubborn.   You lived life by your own rules,not by the whims of others.   Now I understand.   Your indifference to us wasa product of your self-respect.   I told you not to save me.   Damn! Why did you haveto be so stubborn?   I knew it.I know what you are, Cool Ice.   I knew something was strange.   You're immortal.Dio's changed you somehow.   What's happening to me?   You didn't even notice it yourself?   He gave you his blood, didn't he?   I never would have guessed.You're turning into a vampire.   Your body is just like Dio's.   A soulless, filthy vampire!   You bastard!   I must have k*lled your old body   when I drove that saberthrough your gullet.   Bring it!   Come on!What are you waiting for?   Didn't you swearto protect "Lord" Dio?   Come and get me! I'm right here!   What's wrong, Cool Ice?I'm waiting!   You're not going to...   Burn in Hell.   Avdol. Iggy!   Am...   Am I seeing things?   Or...   There's no time.I have to go upstairs   and reach Dio.   Mourning can wait.    AVDOL: DECEASEDIGGY: DECEASED   THE FOOLIGGY   Japan.   Forty-three days have passedsince Jojo and crew began their journey.   Stop the car, Rosas.   I said, stop the car.   SOBA AJIDOKORO   Madam, you don't really intendto visit that soba stand, do you?   Of course I do!   It's been so longsince I've been in Japan.   I'd like a quick bitebefore I go see my daughter.   You! Hold my turtle for me.   You mustn't, Madam!   In Japan, these kindsof establishments are frequented   by common businessmen,not by ladies like yourself.   Madam Joestar, you mustn't.   Oh, calm down. It's so quaint,I have to record it.   How utterly fantastic!   Such local flavor...Good!    NO VOMITING OR PEEING   Mister Rosas.   Have you told Madamabout her daughter Holly's condition?   Over here, Rosas! Hurry!    Coming, Madam!    I haven't uttered a word.    She came to Japan to visit Holly    under the assumptionthat she has pneumonia.    I've worked for the Joestar familyfor    years.    And I've known Lady Hollysince she was in grade school.    I know I haveto tell her the truth,    but I don't havethe heart to tell her.    Being in Japan hasn't changed that.    Holly is at death's door.    She has only a few days left.    Would you like me to tell her, sir?    No. I've been lyingto Madam Joestar long enough.    I shall tell her myself.    Is it true that Holly will be curedif Dio is defeated?    Yes, if we destroy him.    Holly's body is reactingto a certain energy known as a Stand.    Only people with Standscan observe the phenomenon.    Put simply, Dio's evil energyis slowing destroying her.    Madam cannot see Stands.    But she will see her only daughteris in the final throes of death.    You must tell Madam now.    Throes of death?    Rosas, what are you doing out here?    Come have some curry udon with me.    Madam, there's somethingI must tell you.    Oh! I must get some footage     of this fascinatinghealth-drink vending machine!    Good!Would you like one, Rosas?    Madam, please stop!Those are not drinks!    Please listen to me, Madam!    Oh? What is it?    Well, it's about Lady Ho--    Look at this Japanese man!Such a unique fashion sense!    Very nice!    Good!    Hello, give me a smile!    What the hell?     Who gave you permissionto videotape me, huh?    Madam, please get back in the car!    Yay!    Come back here, damn it!Messing with me, huh?    Gimme that camera!    Who the hell are you?Damn foreign hag!    Looking to see some blood, bitch?Huh?    That's quite enough.    I forbid you to lay a fingeron the Madam.    Madam! You need to learna bit more about Japan!    Okay.    I couldn't tell her    that Lady Hollyhas only a few days left.    To bear such sorrowful news.To traumatize her so...    We're almost here.I still haven't told her.    Soon we'll be in sightof the Kujo house.    I must tell her now.    I must be the one to tell her!    Rosas.    I know there's somethingyou're trying to tell me.    I know what's troubling you.    My daughter's lifeis in danger, isn't it?    When I called her from New York,    Holly would try to be cheerfuland pretend.    She said it was just a cold.    Joseph would alwayscall me on his trips,    saying he was fine and very busy.    But I knew...    I knew something terriblewas happening    to my daughter and husband.    I've been married to himfor fifty years.    She's my own flesh and blood.    I was scared.    I was scared of what I would find.    I so much wantedto see my daughter,    but the thought of going to Japanwas too much.    Since you are aware of the situation,we will tell you the truth.    Your daughter has onlya few more days to live.    Mister Joestar and the otherstraveled to Egypt    to eliminate the sourceof her illness,    but we haven't heardfrom them since.    Please forgive mefor not telling you, Madam.    There was nothingwe could do for Lady Holly,    it was too difficult.    It was so cruel!    What kind of foolishnessis that, Rosas?    There is one thingwe can do for Holly.    Holly.    Mother...    Rosas, listen carefully.    What we can do for my daughteris believe.    I don't understandthe whole picture, but I know    if Joseph and my grandson, Jotaro,are trying to save Holly,    I will put my faith behind them.    He has never let me down,    not since the day we metin Italy fifty years ago.    If he says he's goingto do something, he will do it.    Believe in Jotaro and your father.    You'll get better, and our familywill be together again.    Mother...    Madam... Miss Holly...    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Cool Ice, Billie Jean,D'Arby Younger...    I knew you were incompetent fools!    I can't help but laugh!Serves them right!    Oh the satisfaction,oh the sweet vindication!    That's what they getfor calling me a loser.    Guess who's the loser now!    Pathetic loser.    There's no way you can defeatthe Joestars with that power.    Shut up and get out of the way.    Hey! I want to fight them, too.    You're just an ordinary vampire.    Get in our way and we'll k*ll you.    Behave yourself, loser.    I'll be the onewho finishes off Jotaro!    Stop! There's something up ahead,to the right.    It's a woman...    Please have mercy!    Please don't suck my blood!    I'll do anything you want!Just don't k*ll me, please!    Hey, just wait a second.Calm down.    I swear I won't run away anymore!Please, have mercy on my soul!    Just calm down!    We aren't Dio's minions,and we aren't vampires.    We're the good guys.    We'll help you,but you need to calm down.    Good guys...    Good guys? You're not the vampires?    You're really going to help me?    That's right. We're good.    Good at defending justice.    Sure, we'll help you.    Help you go straight to Hell!    Right, Kakyoin?    This is impossible!How did you do it?    How did you figure it out?    My power is impossible to cr*ck!    Is your power having the faceof a woman on the back of your head?    If you're going to flip your head,    you should make sureyour hands match.    Damn, you're right!    I never noticed. Blast it!    All right, loser.    Tell us where's Dio's room.    Jotaro, don't knock him out.We need him to take us to Dio.    Why, you...    How dare you call me that?I'll show you!    I'll k*ll you!    Lord Dio's blood flows throughmy veins. I'm immortal!    Oh? Did you just sayyou were immortal?    So you're a vampire just like Dio.    Then let me test how immortalyou really are.    You know, for future reference.    Oh my God!    I see. You really are immortal.    Vampire or not, we can still tear youinto a million little pieces.    Come on. Take us to Dio.The sun's about to set.    Okay. But may I ask you one thing?    How did you knowthey call me "loser"?    Good grief.    Nice curtains, Dio has.    Now I can walk, even jump.    It still hurts,but now's not the time to fret.    Finally, Polnareff.We meet at last.    Dio.    At last you show yourself.    So we finally meet, Dio.    I don't have fond memories of them.    I do not regret this journey.    I'll tell you everythingthat just happened.    Not good.Something here is not good!    When did he bring out that Stand?    I shall give you one chance.
02x45 - DIO's World, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:59At last you show yourself,  Dio!  Bravo, Polnareff.You managed to avenge your sister  while traveling all the wayfrom the Far East.  To celebrate I shall gladlytake your life.  I'll give you one chance.  Descend two steps and live.  I'll let you be my servant again.  If you choose death,rise forth to me.   At our first encounter,fear overcame me like a curse.   I let myself submit to your evil.   It was the beginningof a futile existence.   An existence more horrifyingthan death itself.   a life consumed by the sole desireto do your bidding.   But that fear is gone.   The only thing that consumes me nowis a burning will to fight.   In the    days since I first metMr. Joestar and the others,   I've traveled the globe and watchedmy friends die at my feet.   I'll never be scared of you again.   Are you sure about that?   Then climb these stairs.   Interesting, Polnareff.   You've descended the stairs.   So you do want to serve me,after all.   What?   But I went up the stairs.I'm positive...   What's wrong?You appear shaken, Polnareff.   Could it be that you're scared?   In your mindyou thought you stepped up,   but perhaps your descent is a caseof fear overriding consciousness...   That's impossible!I know I just climbed the stairs!   What did he do?Is it his Stand?   Could it be...   Dio's Stand...   The World?   What is...    Polnareff, ever wonderwhat the human soul desires most?   It is human nature to wantto overcome anxiety and fear,   to live free from worry.   People seek fame,   they control others,they acquire wealth.   All for a sense of security.   Marriage and friendship is merelya means of securing peace of mind.   Humans say they wishto help others,   for the sake of love and justice.   But this is only to settletheir own minds.   The foremost desireof the human psyche   is to achieve a senseof secure serenity.   Why then would youpossibly hesitate in serving me?   If you do my bidding,all I speak of will be yours.   Are you not afraid to challenge me?   You know that your deathwill be certain.   It can't be!Am I unconsciously submitting to him?   You are a talented Stand user.   It would be a shame to k*ll you.   Betray Joestar and becomemy everlasting assistant.   I promise you unending peace.   I must resist.   Avdol, Iggy,I need your courage!   Cut the crap, Dio!   I've already d*ed once.   If I die trying to figure out   your Stand's abilities,then so be it!   Then you leave me no choice.   Prepare to die, Polnareff!   Is that The World? Bring it!   Futile!   Mister Joestar!   Don't worry, Polnareff.   Dio!   Was that Dio?   Come on,before he gets away!   I have somethingI have to tell you first.   I saw him use his Stand,but only for a moment.   Or, well, I didn't so muchsee it as feel it...   I can't explain exactly.   Look, here's what happened.   I was climbingthe stairs toward him,   when all of a sudden,I was below where I started!   I know it doesn't make any sense.   I don't get it either.I don't know what he did.   I feel like I'm going crazy.   And it wasn't some hypnosis trickor feat of supersonic speed.   It was a sense of somethingwholly and completely terrifying.   Where are Avdol and Iggy?   They didn't make it.   They d*ed trying to save me.   I see.   Mister Joestar, the sun is setting.   We need to hurry.   You're right.   Hey, loser. What's upstairs?   The towers.   There's also a room at the top.   It's Lord Dio's dwellingduring the day.   Is there another staircaseto the tower?   No. These stairs are it.   Fine, lead the way.   So that's him.    We've never met, but I've knownabout him my entire life.    Yes. I've known him all along.    Since the day I was born.    The same goes for Jotaro.    We'd hoped this daywould never come.    But we always knewwe had to destroy him.    As Joestars we knew,    one day, we would haveto come face-to-face with him.    I have no regrets.    About the journey I've made,or what's about to unfold.    I accept it all.To me, it's never been clearer.    This feeling. I feel embracedby lightness, by good.    Dio is the absence of light.The void.    Joseph and Jotaro are my light.    My body is battered,but I have no fear.    I have goodness, the light,by my side!    We att*ck when he stepsout of the coffin.    Be ready.    Who knows what's in there.    Loser, open the coffin.    Lord Dio, I swear,I haven't betrayed you.    I led them here because I knowyou will dispose of them.    I'm certain of it!    As certain as a man wets himselfwhen pissing in the wind.    Please understand!    Shut up and open the coffin!    Please, oh please,k*ll these bastards,    Lord Dio!    Get ready, this is it!    Huh?    Me?    Why am I inside?    -But I was opening the coffin!-What?    How?    I never took my eyes off him!    Did any one of you seethe loser get in    or get placed in the coffin?    No. I was watchingthe whole time,    and then, suddenly,he was inside!    Polnareff's right!    This isn't a mind trick.And it's not super speed!    sh*t.    This isn't some game!    Run for it!    Damn it!    What are you doing, Polnareff?    Damn it!    What was that?    I couldn't see it, but I couldsense it is far more powerful    than any Stand we've evercome across before.    It was like knowinga bulldozer is behind you    just from the sound of its engine.    I sensed it, too.That insane lust to k*ll us!    It felt like someone shovedan icicle straight up my ass!    If we hadn't escaped,we would've all been k*lled!    This is bad... This is really bad.    The sun's almost belowthe horizon!    Darkness is Dio's domain.He has the advantage now.    Don't tell me you're planningto retreat until dawn.    Listen, Mister Joestar!    I'm not running away nowwith my tail between my legs!    I'm with you, Polnareff.    Listen, I agree with both you.But the tables have turned on us.    We may've encounteredhis Stand, The World,    but we have no clueas to what it can do.    It's like climbing a mountain    without knowing the routeor knowing where the summit is.    Fighting him now would bea guaranteed disaster!    It's as inevitable as burpingafter drinking cola!    We know Dio will come after us!    He'll try to finish us offbefore sunrise!    In the meantime,    we can figure out the true extentof his Stand's powers.    We need to waitfor that opportunity.    No! I can't run!    Avdol and Iggy d*edbecause of me!    I'll fight dirty.    I'll go to Hell and back.I'll do whatever it takes to destroy Dio.    But I won't run away!    Wait, Polnareff!    Forget it, old man.It's no use when he's like this.    Jotaro, what do you thinkwe should do?    Polnareff is going after Dioto fight him.    We're retreating,but we'll also be fighting him.    Which means,    we'll att*ck from both sides.    Hey, you.    We want to buy your truck.Sell it to us.    What'd you say?This baby's my bread and butter!    What're you...    I'm flooring it, Kakyoin!    So, Dio, you finally show yourself!    Run away until dawn?Like hell I will!    I'll settle this on my own!    I don't know how Dio's Stand works,but it doesn't matter.    I'll find a way to defeat him!    I'll assassinate him!    Not so fast, Polnareff!    I told them we need to let you go    'cause it's no use tryingto convince stubborn guys like you.    But the old man and Kakyoininsisted I stick with you,    so here I am.    Jotaro!    Good grief.    THE WORLDDIO    Ah, the automobile...    Such impressive power and speed.    In my youth, all we had werehorse-drawn carriages.    Hold it right there!What do you think you're doing?    This car belongsto U.S. Senator Mr. Phillips!    Wanna puke out your eyes?    My, my... Young people these days.So full of piss and vinegar.    Ow!    Hold your tongue and proceedto the front seat. It's time to drive.    Who the hell are you?    Do you think you canget away with this?    That's right, this is unforgivable!    No one gets away with doingsomething like this to me.    I was valedictorianin high school and college!    I was captainof my college wrestling team!    Even after graduation,people respected me.    That's how I became a politician!    I'm owner of a villaon a thousand-acre plot of land in Hawaii!    My wife is a gorgeous modeltwenty-five years my junior!    I pay fifty times more taxesthan anyone in this town!    I destroyed every enemywho's every stood in my way!    And someday,I'll become president.    I'm Senator Phillips, dammit!    You listen to me, punk!    I'll make sure you rot in prison!    You hear me? You'll live the restof your life behind bars--    I'll say it one more time.    Drive.    What is this guy?He's going to k*ll me!    If I don't get out of here,he'll k*ll me!    Someone help--    What?    What?    I thought I jumped out of the car,so why...    Why am I back in the car?    Why am I back inside?    Catch up to that truck.    Fail and I'll k*ll you.    Yes, sir.    Why am I still inside? Why?    Ah, of course!It's because I'm a senator!    There's nothinga senator can't do!    I can still sense Dio's sinister,foreboding bloodlust.    He's after us.    I know he's following us!    Does Dio knowyour precise location?    No. He stole the bodyof my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar.    I can sense his body somehow,    but I can only tellthat he's close by.    I can't pinpointhis exact location.    The same wayI could tell he was in Cairo,    but I couldn't narrow downthe precise location of his lair.    All he knows isthat Jotaro and I are nearby.    But he can't tell the differencebetween us.    Most likely he hasn't realizedthat we've split up.    That's strange.    Cars always start upwhen they do this in the movies.    It's a traffic jam.    The evening commuteis always like this.    Keep going.    But there's nowhere to go.    There's plenty of roomon the sidewalk. Go.    The sidewalk?    It's covered with peopleheading home from work!    I don't care. Go.    Yes, sir!    -Step on it.-Yes, sir!    Okay, it's running.Get on, Polnareff.    Right...    See what I do for you!    You'll spare me...    You'll spare this senator's lifenow, won't you?    No.    That's it! This is a dream!    I'm a senator.There's no way I could die.    It's a dream! A dream! Hooray!    There they are.Catch up. Get closer.    I can't use The Worldunless I'm close to them.    He's getting closer.It's that car! Dio's in there!    Kakyoin!    Kakyoin's...    Take this, Dio! Emerald Splash!    Incredible!    He deflected my att*ckwith one finger.    And all while sittingperfectly still!    Then what about this?    I concentrated the Splash,but he still dodged it.    Damn!    When did he bring out his Stand?    How could I've missed that?    He's too far away.    He flew out of The World's range.    What's happening?    And what would I getby telling you?    Pay attention to the roadand drive.    Careful, Kakyoin!You're too close!    Forgive me. I didn't...    I remember a few months agowhen he said to me,    "Are you really goingto vomit out of fear?"    "Relax, Kakyoin, relax..."    Bastard! Never again!I won't lose again!    Kakyoin, are you all right?    Did you catch a glimpseof The World?    Yes. I att*cked himfrom around ten meters away.    If I had gotten any closer,I would have been done for.    It's clear his Stand holdsa power more horrific    than we could ever imagine.    We may not know its secret,but we do know two things:    First, his Stand can't reachas far as my Hierophant Green    or your Hermit Purple.    It's a close-range power Stand,like Star Platinum,    and has a rangeof about ten meters.    Second,it att*cked me with its fist,    so it doesn't useprojectile weapons like b*ll*ts.    If we can sneak up on himand get within ten meters,    we might have a chance.     We have to figure out his secret,but we also need to proceed carefully.    We can't betoo careful with Dio.    Something's up.His car stopped.    Watch out!Something's hurtling this way!    Mister Joestar!    What are you doing, Kakyoin?    I've got it.    I know how to find the secretof his Stand.    I wonder why I get goosebumpswhen I think about Avdol and Iggy.    Perhaps becausethey were the first friends    I shared a common goal with.    This journey to defeat Dio.    Show me your Stand, Dio!
02x46 - DIO's World, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 09:00What are you doing, Kakyoin?  I've got it.  I know how to find the secretof his Stand.  What?  For Noriaki Kakyoin,Hierophant Green is a reminder.  It's about Noriaki.  He makes no attempt to socializewith the other children.  It's not that he's disliked.  He seems rather reserved;too reserved, in fact.   As his teacher,I'm very concerned.   I'm ashamed to say,   but I'm afraidI don't understand it either.   It was always the same loop of thoughtsrunning through my head:   We all live in cities,and meet all sorts of people.   But how often do we makea genuine human connection?   All of my classmates'have address books   filled with their friends' names.   Each one of them must havea book of fifty,   maybe one hundred names.   Mom has dad, and dad has mom.   But I'm different.   I'm sure rock starsand TV celebrities   have tens of thousands of friends.   But I'm different.   I'll never have any friends.   No one will ever get me.No one can see Hierophant Green.   How can I relate to someonewho can't see the real me?   That's how I used to think.   Until I met Mr. Joestar, Jotaro,Polnareff, and Avdol.   Why does the mere thoughtof Avdol and Iggy   make the hairs on my backstand on end?   I know.It's because they're   the first peoplewho treated me like a friend.   Our goal to defeat Dio, together.   Our journeymay've been short-lived,   but we grew to be true friends.   For Noriaki Kakyoin,Hierophant Green was a revelation!   I'll make Hierophant Greenthe way it used to be.   Invisible to everyone!   I'll make Hierophant imperceptibleto reveal Dio's secret   before finishing him off for good!    EPISODE   : DIO'S WORLD, PART      Look, Jotaro!   The cars are totaled!   Up there.   The old man and Dio are upon the roof.   I see only Kakyoin and Josephbefore me.   Interesting.   They split up to att*ck mefrom both sides.   Jotaro and Polnareff must be comingafter me from behind.   Futile.   This is...   Kakyoin's Hierophant Green!   He turned it into a web?   -This is...-That's right!   The web fires on contact.   And it has you completely surroundedfor    meters in every direction!   I can sense youand your Stand's every move!   Take this, Dio!Twenty-meter radius Emerald Splash!   You fool. Find out for yourself.   The true power of The World   is the power to rule the world!   Show me your Stand, Dio!   The World!   What? Kakyoin!   Something just sent himhurtling through the air!   But how?   Kakyoin!   What just happened?   Did he get me?   It's no use. It must be fatal.   I can't speakor even move my finger.   It's  :  .   And midnight in Japan.   I wonder what mom and dadare doing.   I suppose they're already asleep.   I'm sorry for causing youso much worry.   Noriaki Kakyoin's last thoughts were notof his parents back in Japan.   Now his parental musingshad given way to the single question   that bewildered himmore than any other.   I can sense any movementwithin Hierophant Green's web.   But Dio managed to breakthe entire web in one moment.   Not one strand at a time,   but all of them at once.   Without even a ten-thousandthof a second difference.   How did he instantaneously shatteran entire   -meter-radius area?   How?   Not even a slight delay...   How all at once?   How?   Kakyoin!   Enough! Hermit...   Joseph, you're next.   For Jonathan's body to finallybecome completely mine,   I must drink the bloodof a Joestar.   Now's as good a time as any,don't you think?   Dio!   Why all at once?Without the slightest delay in time...   Time...    Time...    The time!    I got it.    How could this be?There's no other explanation.    I have to tellthe others somehow!    The disturbing realitybehind his ability.    I have to tell Mr. Joestar.    Otherwise, everyone will...    die.    You're not getting away with this!    I'll take that body back,for Granny Erina!    Erina? That country bumpkin?    Nonsense.    I predict I drink all of your blood.Then you die.    Joseph Joestar!    Die!    My last Emerald Splash...    A final pointless att*ck?    Behold, a "hero"in the throes of death...    I suppose that washis last pathetic attempt    to make his mark on the world.    No!    Kakyoin would neverjust throw in the towel    with some meaningless att*ck.    Why did he strike the clock?    What does it mean?    Was he trying to tell me something?    It's a message.    I have nothing left...    Mister Joestar...    You must understand.    You must tell the others.    Kakyoin!    Noriaki Kakyoind*ed that moment.     NORIAKI KAKYOINDECEASED    Hermit Purple!    Prepare yourself, Dio!    Hamon of the Sun!    You senile old fool!Your Stand is the weakest of all!    You're not escaping me!    Kakyoin,why did you destroy the clock?    You were tryingto tell me something    by aiming for the clock tower,weren't you?    It must mean something!    It's Mr. Joestar!    And Dio's chasing him.    Where's Kakyoin?    Did you, Kakyoin,    in the face of death,figure out the secret of his Stand?    Destroying the clockwith Emerald Splash.    Destroying the clock's hands.    Stopping the clock.    Impossible! Dio's Stand...    The power of The World...    It can stop time!    Take this, Dio!Twenty-meter radius Emerald Splash!    The World!    Behold The World.    Since time is stopped for you,you likely see and feel nothing.    Die, Kakyoin!    You don't even knowyou're about to die.    You have no knowledgeof what has just occurred.    I got it, Kakyoin!    Your dying message... I got it!     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    A Stand that can freeze time?    Freeze time and still move freelywithin space?    That's unbelievable!    A Stand like that,can anyone b*at it?    Calm down and think!    The word "panic"isn't in my vocabulary.    I will find a way...    I will find a way to defeat him!    He's gone!    What's the matter?    Aren't you going to hit me, Dio?    I thought you were goingto drink my blood.    So you're running Hamon throughyour body to protect yourself.    You've wrapped your bodywith Hamon-infused Hermit Purple,    like a cloak of high-voltage wires.    Very resourceful.Truly a geriatric genius.    Same to you.    You figured out I was using Hamonand made sure not to touch me.    Perceptive son of a...    But I figured one thing outabout your Stand.    You can stop time,but only for a short while.    Only about three to four seconds,I'd say.    If you could stop time longer,    you would've already k*lled usback at your mansion,    and you wouldn't have hadto come after us.    So you understandThe World's ability?    Kudos, Joseph.    It was Kakyoin who figured it out.    Kakyoin didn't die in vain!    And so what?    So what if you know my ability?    What can your pathetic Hamon do?    -Hermit Purple and Hamon!-Enough!    I can k*ll you without touchingthe Hamon!    Hey, look.    Some old man fell out of the sky!    I bet he's Santa Claus!    What were you doing on the roof?    Looking for pretty girls below?    Old man!    Jotaro! Stay back!    Don't come near me!    Jotaro... Such good timing.    But he's still out of my range.    I'll finish Joseph off first.    Jotaro! The World controls time!    It's a Stand that can stop ti--    The World!    In the beginning, I could stop timeonly long enough to blink.    But as my neck began to heal,    I was able to stop timefor two seconds, then three.    Now I can stop timefor as long as five seconds.    Then again, time is stopped,    so all I can say is that it feelslike five seconds.    Soon I'll be able to stop timefor one minute...    Then ten minutes, an hour...    And later, as long as I desire!    How fun it will be.    Being able to stop timeto my heart's content...    Oh, I almost forgot.    Joseph's protecting his bodywith Hamon.    Hamon was a thorn in my sideone hundred years ago,    but it's powerlessagainst The World.    Futile!    Joseph, grandson of Jonathan,    you're dead!    One...    Zero.    THE WORLDDIO    Old man!    Stay back! Run... Jotaro...    Don't get near him.    Keep your...    distance...    Stay away from him...    He's... invincible...    I've already taken care of Kakyoin.    Polnareff must be hiding somewhere.    But it doesn't matter.    You're next, Jotaro!    You bastard.    Dio!    Oh? So you want to fight?    Instead of running,you're moving in closer.    How ungrateful. And afteryour dear grandfather, Joseph,    gave his life to tell youthe power of The World.    He was so desperate,like a pathetic student struggling    to fill in the last few answers of a testas the final seconds tick by...    I can't b*at you to a pulpfrom far away.    Oh, then approach as you must.    You're slow! The Worldis the most powerful Stand.    The World's speed and powerfar outmatches your Star Platinum,    regardlessof its time-stopping ability.    Your Stand is similarto my Star Platinum.    We don't have long range,    but we have incrediblepower and precision.    I always wanted to seehow much stronger    The World is than Star Platinum.    Though it seems pointlesseven to compare.    You wanted to compare?    All you didwas pat me on the leg.    Well, I guess you did ripmy   ,   -yen pants, though.    Why are you Joestars so stubborn?    You can never admit defeat,can you?    Fine, I'll accept your provocationand resume our comparison.    A comparison of punching speed, eh?    Futile!    I first experienced stopped timehalf a year ago.    It began when everything around meseemed to have stopped.    It will be The World's true powerthat deals the final blow!    The World, stop time!
02x47 - DIO's World, Part 3QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 09:00Futile!  Futile!  So I was right.  The World's speed and powerfar exceeds anything  in your pathetic repertoire of tricks!  Enough play. I am content.  I will finish you with a single blow!  I swore I would never againshow mercy  to any descendant of the Joestars.You must all die swiftly!   The World's true powerwill finish you for all eternity!   The World! Stop time!   The World!   Futile!    EPISODE   : DIO'S WORLD, PART     And now, the Joestar line ends here.   Oh, perennial nemesisand fateful burden...   I bid thee farewell!   Wha...   What?   He just moved!   He... Impossible!   His finger just moved!   Could it be?   They're the same?   It's the same type of Standas Star Platinum.   The World and Star Platinumare the same type of Stand?   Jotaro, can you see me?   Or are you movingyour hand unconsciously?   Time's up.   Could you see me?   I asked if you could see me, Jotaro!   See what?   I don't knowwhat you're talking about, Dio.   Fine! Have it your way!   When time is standing still,your ability to see me is irrelevant!   If you can move like The World does,   then show me!   The first time I managedto stop time was six months ago.   To test my Stand's power and speed,   I ordered my servant to firehis shotgun in my direction.   As I reached to grab a b*llet,   for a split second,it looked as if time had stood still.   That's when it all began.   Perhaps I was seeing things, I thought.   Is this the sensationof an elite boxer witnessing   his opponent's puncheslingering in midair?   Has my sense of time slowed,like a victim watching   his fate unfold moments whena second feels like an eternity.   But my Stand, The World,was able to move between   the hovering b*ll*tssuspended in time...   and grasp them!   It was no illusion!   Lord Dio!   One day,you will dominate time!   You must believe that   you can move amid the realmof frozen time!   It must be like breathing.   Or like snapping an HB pencilbetween your fingers!   You must believeit's completely ordinary.   What's important is thatyou believe you can do it.   You must have the mental fortitudeto push aside your doubts!   You are the ruler of this world!   Controlling time is second nature!   Then one day,   I sensed the wheels of timeand The World interlock.   Like a ray of light dispersingthe shadows,   a revelation befell me.My mind was never clearer.   I, Dio, have surpassedall living things, all Stand users!   Now I can stop timefor five seconds.   And day by day,that time will grow longer!   Jotaro!   Now I shall seejust how powerful you truly are!   The World! Stop time!   You planted a magnet on me.   He must have attached it to my sleevewhen we were exchanging blows.   It looks like a wallet magnetor a magnet from a pocket planner.   You had me fooled.   Very clever indeed.   But...   a trick like this just proves   you can't move while timeis standing still!   You only postponed your deathby a few seconds!   This time, you will...   die, Jotaro!   What?   He... can really move!   Only momentarily, but he can!   The magnet wasn't soI would think he could move...   It was so I would think he couldn't move!It was a trick to lure me in!   You must believeit's completely ordinary!   To think that one of the Joestarscould inv*de my domain...   It is infuriating!   I was able to move for a second...Just a second.   But...   Good grief.   Just enough time for one punch.   You. Woman.   Go fetch me my leg.   Bring it to me now!    Imagine you're a flight attendantbringing wine and caviar    to a passenger in first class!    But it seemsI'll have to blow your head off    to do any real damage.    Looks like you've already recovered.    That gaping hole I opened inyour gut has healed over.    Your eyes followed mewhile time was at a standstill.    You can see me moving,can you, Jotaro?    Thanks to him.    Kakyoin did you quite the favor.    Because he figured outThe World's secret,    you knew I can stop time,    and then you learned how to do it.    Which makes me wonder...    Exactly how long can you movewhile time is frozen?    Two seconds? Three?    Or perhaps, like me,you can move five seconds,    but you're just pretendingthat you can't move longer?    Well?    This isn't good.    I could probably move longerwith some practice,    but right now,the best I can do is a second.    I speculate you can movefor only a single second.    Still, you have managedto infiltrate my world.    Only a fool would riskapproaching you now.    My advantage over youis overwhelming, yes, but...    Jotaro, I've devised a wayto execute you    regardless of how longyou can move!    You've grown pale.    These knives must bringback memories, no?    You know you're goingto die a death    even more terrible thanthat pathetic old man Joseph.    Bastard!    How the hell does he come upwith stuff like this?    This is really bad.    You can't escape!    The World!    Five seconds!    Once time resumes,    can your Star Platinum reallydeflect all of the knives?    Four seconds!    It must be terrifyingto helplessly gaze upon    the agent of your imminent death!    Three seconds.    Just two more seconds.Is that all you can do?    That is the proofof your short-lived abilities.    One second.    Zero.    It's over.    And one more just in case.    To be frank,    I'm relieved that I could defeat youso quickly, Jotaro.    I never would have thoughtyou would infiltrate my perfect world.    I suppose a fitting analogy isthe automobile.    Those moving machines are useful,    but only when the roadsare not clogged with them.    The master of time must be me,and me alone.    Good grief.    Throw enough knives?    He had to go and turn my favorite uniforminto Swiss cheese.    Glad I stuffed my clotheswith magazines.    I figured he'd try throwingsomething at me    but that many was a surprise.    My best bet now is to play possum    and wait for a chance to strike.    I've got to smash his head inand destroy his brains    or he'll never die.    As they say,one can never be too careful.    The Joestars have always enjoyeduncommonly auspicious luck.    He may very well be playing dead.    I have to make surehe is completely devoid of life!    I'll use this...    to chop off his head!    Prepare for your final blow...    Jotaro!    Die, Dio!    Polnareff!    The World!Time is stopped.    So it's you, Polnareff?    And time resumes.    Such a shame, Polnareff.    Just a split second more,    and with just a bit more oomph,    you could have jostled my braininto a mess of scrambled eggs.    Bastard! This can't be...    It's impossible to k*ll me.    After I'm through with you,    Joestar's Merry Tour of Egyptwill come to a tragic end.    Damn it.    At this rate,Polnareff's going to end up dead.    I was going to play deaduntil the last moment possible    before landing a critical blowto his cranium, but...    saving Polnareff would be easy.    But he won't come within rangeof Star Platinum.    It'll end up just like last time.    I can't let him know I'm alive.    As long as he thinks I'm dead,    I'll still have a chanceto get close to him.    It's kind of twisted.    One minute I'm trying to movewhile time has stopped,    and the nextI'm trying to stay completely still.    Farewell, Polnareff!    Jotaro...    Is he aliveor is he regaining consciousness?    Freeze! Police!    Try anything and we'll sh**t!    Now put up your hands slowly.    Ah, what perfect timing.    There's someone I'd like you to sh**t.    It's that man lying over there.    sh**t his leg, his torso,whatever you please.    Come on. Be sure you hit him.    I thought I heard Jotaromake a sound    or was it my imagination?    That sick bastard...    But now his attention is on me,not Polnareff.    He's more than suspicious.    Now he's gonna makedoubly sure I'm dead.    It's only going to get worsefrom here.    Is he breathing?    No, I don't hear respiration.He's not breathing.    Then a heartbeat?    sh*t, this hurts like a...    If I black out,I'll never come back.    If I die because I usedmy Stand to stop my heart,    now that's sick irony...    No heartbeat.He really is dead.    His being alive was justa figment of my imagination.    I'd better behead himfor peace of mind, just in case.    You won't mind right, Jotaro?    What?    Stop time!    The World!    You put me through hell back there.    I'll be damned if I let you tryto stop the clock again,    let alone escape withyour skull intact... Dio.    What? It can't be...    Finally...    Finally, I got to run my fistinto his skull.    But that shithead Dio    lived at the bottom of the seafor over a century.    I can't be surethat bastard's croaked.    This is no time to celebrate.    I'll m*rder you.    What? But how?No! My legs...    I can't move my legs.    I can't stand up!     My head! The excruciating pain...I think I'm going to vomit.     How could this happen?Me, Dio, feel sick?     He damaged my brain.I can't move my legs!    Blast it! I've got to...     I've doused you with gasolineso I can sniff you out.     I hate to kick a guywhen he's down, but...     well, actually I don't give a damn.     It's because of youthat my friends     and countless innocent bystandersare dead.    The World!    If I can...    If I can just make it there...    And now, time will start again.     He had his earto the ground listening for cars.    But...    I can't let him get away!    Just a little farther!    I'm almost there.    Sorry, spot's taken.You're not getting away.    Give it up, Dio.    The World!    You fell for it, Jotaro!    This is my escape route!    I, Dio, have outsmarted you!    Doesn't this street look familiar?    This street... It can't be...    That's right.    My escape route is to drink the bloodof your grandfather, Joseph Joestar!    Dio, you bastard!    Jotaro...    This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?    Joestar blood suits me so well!    This is the greatest high!    There's one simple answer.    You're going to...
02x48 - Long Journey Farewell, My FriendsQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 09:01As I expected...  Joseph's blood suits me well.  It feels absolutely perfectin this body,  so much richer and rejuvenatingthan that which came before!  It feels so good...  So incredibly good!  One hundred years ago, this bodybelonged to Jonathan Joestar.  And now, with these very hands,  I have feasted on the bloodof his grandson, Joseph!   And you are the one who hasso thoughtfully led me here, Jotaro.   The Joestar family has always beenan unsightly nuisance to me,   like the roadside excrement leftby some mangy mutt.   In the end,   it appears that the Joestarsare fated to serve me.   Old man...   Old man.   From here on...   No matter what Dio triesto do to my body,   never lose your cool.Never succumb to rage, Jotaro.   Don't worry about me.   It was meant to be.   Could that bethe old man's soul?   Kakyoin solved the secretbehind Dio's Stand.   And I passed it on to you.   If we had all fought Dio togetherin one single moment,   none of us would be alive.   You've learned to movewhile time is frozen.   You have two or three seconds now.   Use that time wisely.   No matter what Dio does,don't lose your head.   It'll only backfire if you loseself-control and att*ck.   Jotaro...   What a journey it's been.   My boy, we had quitethe adventure.   These last fifty days.   We managed to have our fun,didn't we?   Call me crazy,but I've never had more fun in my life.   Was I seeing things?   Hey!   What are you looking at, Jotaro?   You damn bastard.   I've sucked him dry!   Old man, I know you told meto keep my cool.   But he just crossed the line.   There's not a man on earthwho could stay calm after seeing that!   This is the final round!   The World!   Futile!    EPISODE   : LONG JOURNEYFAREWELL, MY FRIENDS    The World! Stop time!   Wry!   One second! Two seconds.   Three seconds! Four...   Five seconds.   Six seconds.   Seven seconds!   I can feel it!I have power to spare!   I can still stop time!   But you, Jotaro,   I know you can't move any longer.   So you gambledon getting me two seconds   before time resumed, huh?   You've miscalculated.   I feel invigorated!   I could sing!   Eight seconds!   I've been immortalfor an entire century,   but I've never felt so good!   The blood of the Joestars surgesthrough my vines!   This is the greatest high knownto man!   Old man,guess you were right.   My temper just got mein a whole mess of trouble.   But you know what?   He still hasn't feltthe full brunt of my rage!   Nine seconds!   I was able to stop timefor nine seconds!   Perhaps this is my limit.   You bastard!   Now to unleashall of my Stand's power!   Jotaro! You mumbled somethingabout being angry.   Is this all you've got?   Futile!   And now, without further ado,the k*lling blow!   This is the ultimate,my final dance with time!   In the next nine seconds,while time is suspended,   you shall die!   The World!   One second.   Two seconds.   Three seconds.   Jotaro had no idea.He didn't understand why Dio   had disappeared amidstthe standstill of time.   Four seconds.   Jotaro gave up pondering.   No matter what Dio's plans,   no matter what att*ckhe attempts to unleash,   Jotaro had only two secondsto respond.   Only two seconds to driveStar Platinum's fists into Dio,   once and for all!    Five seconds.    All I know is that the next timeI see that god damned face,    I'm gonna freakin lose it!    Six seconds.    Bring it, Dio!    Seven seconds.    Take this steam roller!    It's too late!It's impossible escape!    Futile!    Futile!    Eight seconds!    I'll obliterate you!    Nine seconds.    I did it.    It's over.    The World has defeatedStar Platinum!    I am immortal!I am everlasting!    Stand power!    This proves that no one isstronger than me, Dio!    Pathetic humans!I shall rule over all of you forever!    Bow before my wisdom and power!    Ten seconds!    And with that,I can stop time for ten seconds!    Now, then...    I suppose I should inspect Jotaro'slifeless body and drink his blood.    If there's any blood left to savor!    What?    My body's slowing down.    No... I'm not slowing down.    I can't move. No!    My body won't move at all!    Dio!    It's been eleven seconds.    Guess that's your limit.    What?    I stopped time at nine seconds.    And got outfrom beneath that roller.    Good grief.    Now...    It won't take even a secondto finish you off!    Jotaro!    THE WORLDDIO    This can't be happening!You stopped time?    You waited for me to use upmy nine seconds.    How does it feel, Dio?    Having your archenemy tower behind youwhile you stand frozen and helpless?    I guess it's kinda like underwater divingwhile holding your breath.    Your air runs out, you swimto the surface, desperate for air...    And when you finally make itto the water's edge,    ready to take a gulpof that glorious, fresh air,    you feel a tug,and are yanked back down into the deep.    Sound about right?    But I don't feel sorryfor you at all.    Time is moving again.    Compassion is somethingyou'll never get from me.    I have zero sympathyfor your sorry ass.    Then again,k*lling you while you're helpless    would leave a bad tastein my mouth.    How long will it takefor you to heal?    Three seconds? Four seconds?    The second your legsare ready for action,    Star Platinum will smash your headall over the pavement.    Bring it!    If this were the Wild West,this is when the hero would say...    "Draw! You've got one sh*t."    How dare...    he mock me?    Oh... But Jotaro,    at this eleventh hour,    you can't help but uttersuch a human declaration.    You think like a true mortal,cursed with a fleeting life.    A bad taste in your mouth?    Are you afraid you'd regret it?    Your reasoning is as pathetic as    a rat dropping in the cornerof a bathroom stall.    Your foolish honorwill be your demise!    I, on the other hand,think differently.    All I have on my mindis one simple goal.    Just one!    To dominate! Nothing more.    That is my fulfillment!    How I do it...    doesn't matter!    How'd you like a little bloodin your eyes?    I win! Die!    Wha...    What?    Impossible! I'm Dio!    I'm Dio!    When the sun rises,you'll return to dust.    You made one mistake, Dio.    Just one mistake.    You pissed me off.     DIO... THE WORLDANNIHILATED. DECEASED    This is Speed WagonFoundation Car Two.    We're traveling northbound onthe Al-Nil Expressway.    And we've retrieved Dio's remains.    I repeat.We've retrieved Dio's remains.    Dio's body is showingcellular activity.    He must be exposed to sunlightas soon as possible.    Proceed with extreme caution!    Take every precaution necessary.    Roger.    Noriaki Kakyoin is dead.    We are transporting his bodyvia helicopter.    Jean Pierre Polnareffis unconscious.    The medical staff of Car Onehas taken him into their care.    Roger.    Car Two, I have a question...    Why have you placedthe remains of Dio    and Joseph Joestarinto the same car?    Because it's not over.    -Dio borrowed something from us.-Huh?    And we need it back.    I'm afraid I don't follow.    A blood transfusion betweenthe two bodies, can you do it?    Are you suggestingwe transfuse Dio's blood    into Mr. Joestar's corpse?    To bring Mr. Joestar back to life?    Dio drained his bloodonly minutes ago.    Dio's upper half is gone,but we'll take what we can.    I think we can still make it.    Did you hear that? Over.    Roger...    It's impossible!He doesn't have a pulse.    His heart has stopped.    We can't circulate his bloodwithout a working heart!    Impossible?    Just about everythingon this journey has been impossible.    I'm sick of hearing wordslike "impossible" or "futile."    They mean nothing to us.    You said you can do itif his heart's b*ating, right?    Well, you're in luck.    Thanks to Dio,    I've already had some practicewith stopping and starting hearts.    I hear a pulse!    His heart's b*ating!    Hurry! Extract the bloodfrom Dio's corpse    and transfuse it to Joseph!    This just might work!    Look!    His skin is regaining its color!    His lifeless flesh is softeningand filling out!    Brain activity!We have brain activity!    I don't believe it!His vitals are good!    His eyes! He opened his eyes!    We did it! He's back!    Old man?    You're a fool, Jotaro!    Don't freakin tell me...    You've single-handedlyresurrected yours truly!    You bastard!    Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding!Kidding! I'm just kidding!    Just kidding! It was a joke!    I'm sorry!I was just messing with you.    I swear it's me!    Joseph Joestar.Born September   th,     .    Wife's Suzie Q.I collect comics as a hobby!    Who's the leading actressin the      film Tarzan, the Ape Man?    Bo Derek.    Who sang "Eat It",the spoof of "b*at It"?    "Weird Al" Yankovic.    Good grief. I guess it is you.    Only you would knowpointless crap like that.    This is Car Two. It's unbelievable!    Mr. Joestar is awake!    Mr. Joestar has come backfrom the brink!    It's a miracle! Over!    We've taken back what's ours,    Dio.    It's over.     Dio took something from all of us.     For the past hundred years,    he's taken whatever he wanted.    He's taken far too much.     Yeah.Things we can never get back.    The loss is as vast as this planet.    But thanks to their sacrifices,    we stand here today.    Kakyoin.    Iggy.    Avdol.    It's over.    So you're really going backto France, huh, Polnareff?    But your family's gone.     Why don't you come staywith us in New York?    Mister Joestar, they may be gone,but France is my home.    It's filled with my memories.    It's a placeI must always return to.     If you ever need anything, call me.     I'll find you, wherever you may be.    We're gonna miss you.    It sure wasn't easy,    but I had one hell of a time.    Thanks to you guys.    Yeah.    We're a team.We'll always be.    Calling passengersof France International Airlines    Flight    to Paris,    please proceed to Gate   .    See you, you old bastard!    I wish you a long, long life!
