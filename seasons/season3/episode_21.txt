02x21 - Judgement, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:39Previously onJojo's Bizarre Adventure...  Hey, old man.Something's not right.  We're going in the wrong direction.  It looks like we're headingfor that island.  But before we arrive in Egypt,we need to make a slight detour.  Someone is waiting for us.  He is a man who is extremelyimportant to our journey.  An important man?  Hey, what's the big deal?Does someone actually live here?   This is such a tiny island,it's practically deserted.   Agreed.   Mr. Joestar,are you sure someone lives here?   He's been living onthis island by himself.   A man told me back in India.   Huh? When you say a "man to--"   What?! Mangos from India?    EPISODE   :JUDGEMENT, PART     Hey!   Somebody's watching usfrom the bushes.   What?   Hey!   From the back, he looks...   Right. I know that face!   Hold on! Just wait!   Eat up, now.   Are you hungry, Michael?How about you Prince?   I mixed in your favorite,crushed sea shells, just for you!   There's more over here.   Make sure to get nice and fat,   so you'll be a tasty chicken,Lionel.   It's not possible... That man...   It can't be...   It can't be!   I'll go and talk with him.   The rest of you,just wait here for now.   My name is Joseph Joestar.   My friends and I are travelingon expedition to Egypt--   Go away! I won't hear it!   His voice sounds like...   Don't talk to me!   It's always bad newswhen someone comes to talk to me!   It's only when something terriblehas happened!   I don't want to hear it!   I said go!   Mr. Avdol!   Avdol...   Go away!   That's...   impossible!   That wasn't Avdol.   It was his father.   His father?   He withdrew from society,and lives alone on this island.   I'm sorry I wasn't able to tell yousooner...   but if it ever came known to Diothat we stopped at this place,   Avdol's father would be putin grave danger.   I would never forgive myselfif that happened.   But...   telling him what happenedto his son...   won't be easy...   Polnareff!   Avdol's death wasn't your fault.   No, it's entirely my fault.   I'll carry that burdenfor as long as I live.   Is it safe to assumehis father is a Stand user?   Yes, but I don't knowwhat sort of Stand it is.   Judging from his father'sreaction to us,   I doubt he'll offer usmuch assistance.   You just leave the talking to me.   Hopefully my wordswill be able to reach him.   All I wanted was to avengemy sister's death.   And I end up k*lling my friend.   There's nothing I could possibly doto make it up to his father...   Talk about depressing...   This thing is pretty shiny.   I wonder if it camefrom a ship wreck?   Just look at all these barnacles.   Looks like some sort ofmetal container...   It's got some sort ofweird face carved into it.   It might be worth something.   Now, if I can scratch offthese barnacles.   What the...   It's gone!   What in the worldhappened just now?   Guess the pressurized airinside just burst out.   It's not like it's Aladdin'smagic lamp or anything...   That really startled me!   You get three!   Three I say!   Your wish is my command!   Three wishes for whateveryour heart desires.   What sort of fresh hell is this?   I am known as Cameo.   Allow me to thank you forfreeing me from the lamp.   Now name three wishesyou'd like to come true...   So another Stand user!   Silver Chariot!   This guy's not half bad.   What awesome power...    Listen buddy!    Your strength tells me,your user is close by!    Now who is it?    Would you like the answerto that question    to be consideredas your first wish?    It's a little on the boring side,if you ask me.    Don't pull that"Genie in the bottle" crap with me!    Are you saying you couldmake me rich right now?    Huh?    Is that your first wish?    Let's see you do it!    Stop jerking me around, damn it!    Very well.Your wish shall be granted.    Wha...    What was all that about?    Was that thing a Standor wasn't it?    He's a strange one.    He didn't att*ck me,but told me to make three wishes.    I don't know what's going on,but I don't trust this guy.    Someone shady is on this island.    I should tell Mr. Joestarabout what just happened.    It could have something to dowith Avdol's father...    That's weird...    What's up with all thatloud clanging back there...    Is this for real?But it can't be!    This is gold fromthe Napoleonic era.    This isn't a dream or an illusion.    It's the real thing.A treasure trove of gold!    Are you mocking me or something?    No... Can't be.    When could he have buriedthis gold here?    No way he had time to bury itafter I made my wish.    How the hell didthat freak do all this?    Now, what is your second wish?    Your wish is my command.    Bastard!    Why are you doing this?What are you scheming?    I'm not falling foryour stupid tricks!    If you're my enemy,then fight me like one!    If not, I'll take this treasurefor myself.    I take it knowing the answer tothat question is your second wish?    Though, it's a little on the boring side,if you ask me.    But I owe you forletting me out of that lamp,    so I shall grant your wish.    You smug bastard!    All right then... I do have a wish...    I want to be a comic artist!    That was always my dreamwhen I was a kid!    I wanna be bigger than Disney!    Not some starving artist!    I'm gonna buildmy own Polnareff-land!    Wait, scratch that.    Just give me a second.    Any minute now... It'll come to me...    I want a girlfriend!    More than money or fame...    I want true love!    Not only someone who's really cute,    but a relationship connected bythe red string of love...    I want to meet a girl    who feels the same way about meas I do about her!    So grant that if you can, damn it!    You want a girl, do you?Very well.    Wait, no, never mind!I need more time.    The deceased...    Can you bring them back?    From the dead?    Am I to assume your wanting to know    the answer to that questionis your second wi--    Enough already!    I'm asking you to bringmy dead sister back to life!    And you can do the samefor my friend Avdol!    But that's just too muchfor you, right?    Very well.    I shall grant your wish.    What?     SILVER CHARIOTJEAN PIERRE POLNAREFF    So you can really... do it?    Indeed.But since you made two wishes,    I'll grant themin the order you asked.    First, I will grantyour second wish    to bring back your sister.    Hail to you!    Hold it! Who the hell are you?    Why are you--    What was that sound?    I'm sure I heardsomething rustling...    It sounded like someonewas digging up the ground...    There's that weird digging again!    Where's the sound coming from?    No... it can't be!    Is that a woman crying?    All right, who's there?    These are...    These are strands of hair...    A woman's hair.    A woman's footsteps...    Impossible!    There's no way...This can't be happening...    My little sister is still inher coffin back in France...    Just who the hell are you?    Answer me, now!    Please... stay away...    I'm in so much pain...    My body hasn't fully formed...    I know that voice...    Sherry!    Hey, where'd Polnareff get off to?    I couldn't find him up top.    It's already nightfall,and he's nowhere to be seen.    You don't think he ran into the enemy,do you?    Sherry...    Is it you?    It is you, isn't it?    Where are you going?    Where are you going, Sherry?    Wait Sherry! It's only me!    Sherry, why are you running away?    Come on, Sherry, please,show yourself!    Please, Sherry, wait!    Let me see your face...Let me see it one more time...    Brother!    Higher, brother!Raise me as high as you can!    Yay! Now spin me around!    Oh, it's simply wonderful!    I've been wanting a new umbrella.    Thank you for buying it for me.    I'm off, now.    Sherry!    What... the hell happened here?    They've been half eaten!    Sherry!    Can you hear me?Why are you running away?    It's me, your big brother!    Because... my body is covered in dirt...    And my hair... It's so unkempt...    It's okay, Sherry!Don't worry about that!    You're perfect just as you are.    Why are you crying?    Why are you sad, Sherry?    Sherry...    No.    Just stay back.    Don't come any closer!    What are you saying?You're not making any sense!    It's simple...    I'm saying you'll hate me.    Hate you?    Have I ever told youthat I hate you?    Yes.    When we were kids...    When I gave your favoritetropical fish to the cat...    You got really mad,and said you hated me.    I admit I was angry that day,    but I've always loved youmore than anything!    I still do!    Really?    You've always loved me?    Yes, of course I have!    You'll love me, no matter what?    I love you, no matter what.    And I can clearly see nowyou're the real Sherry.    You have no idea how muchI've missed you!    I see...    I feel the same, big brother.    Sherry, please look this way.    Show methat beautiful face of yours.    Why are you crying?Are you still sad?    Sad?    No, Brother.    These aren't tears of sadness.    What is it then...    I'm...    I'm happy, brother...    cause I can finally eat you!    Chariot!    Sher... ry...    I'm sorry that I bit you, brother.    I'm afraid my body'sstill underdeveloped.    But if I eat your flesh,I'll return to normal.    It's OK if I eat you, right?    You always did what I asked you to.    Cameo!    You rang?    You bastard!    What? Do you have a complaint?    I granted your wish, didn't I?    Granting wishes is my power,after all.    The rest is up to you.    Then I'll tell youmy third wish!    Make my sister...    Make my sister...    Let my sister rest in peace!Return her to her grave!    I don't think so!    What?    You still don't get it,do you Polnareff?    I'm a Stand!    I'm the Stand represented bythe Judgement card!     I extract wishes from the deepestcorners of the human mind,    and manifest themfrom the soil below.    You created your sisterfrom your own yearning!    How dare you...    And since you created her,I cannot undo it.    This match goes to me!    By the way...    I recall you saying somethingabout a third wish,    but you've already made    your third wish.    You...    You don't mean him...    When a man wishes from the heart,    all of his greatest weaknessescome to light.    -Because of you, I...-Avdol, I...    I never thought you'd be this hurt.    I'll get better if I eat, right?    Anything but the third wish...
