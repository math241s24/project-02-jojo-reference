Dio!  So then where is Kakyoin?   He's with Jotaro.   Could I get some ice cream, please?   Welcome.   Heya, miss. Ice cream is good,but this baby here...   chilled coconut juice,nothing in the world like it.   How bout it?   I guess we can try it.   Three then.   Thankya much. That'll be twelve dollars.   Hey, make it six dollars! Six dollars!   This should cover it.   Okay.   Enjoy!   I'll take that!   So you...   Thought you could just grab my wallet,   you disgusting piece of sh*t!   Huh?   I'll have you spewing blood!   Kakyoin!   Why, you...   vile little cockroach d*ck,   how dare you touch my wallet...   with the same grimy fingersthat wipe that filthy ass!   I can't let you get awaywith that, now can I?   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Hey! What are you doing, Kakyoin?   You'll k*ll the bastard.   Oh my God, a back-breaker?   Such a brutal move!   And he's using such filthy language...   It's not like him at all.   Come on! Come on! Come on!   Kakyoin!   I told you to cut it out!What are you, deaf?   Dammit, Kakyoin.   You're not right.   What the hell's gotten into you?   That hurt...   No need to push...   That man tried to steal my wallet.He committed a crime.   And criminals should be punished.   Tell me, am I wrong, Jotaro?   This guy...    What are you glaring at?    The look in your eyesis awfully hostile, Jotaro.   You couldn't possibly be thinkingabout ending our friendship   over a little tussle with a thief,now would you?   Look, a beetle.   -That's awesome!-A beetle? Where?   -There're four of them up there.-I see them!   -There're four of them up there.-So cool!   You're making way too muchout of this, Jojo.   I'm just having a bad day.   I'm so exhausted from the trip,it's put me in such a bad mood.   Just a bad mood, huh?   Seemed to me you felt pretty good.   The old man and Avdol   think it's a good ideafor us to head to India by train.   We leave tomorrow.   We'll take the cable car   to Singapore Station to reserve tickets.   Mr. Kakyoin...   Jojo's already gone.   Right. I'll catch up in just a second.   I guess you like coconut juicea whole lot, huh, Mr. Kakyoin?   Huh?   Was that a beet...   No. I must be imagining things.   It must have been a piece ofcoconut or something.   Oh yes. I do love coconuts.   What's up, half pint?   Uh, nothing.   Hey, Jotaro.   Are you going to eat that cherry?   If not, then hand it over already.   I'm starving.   Uh-oh! Better watch out, Jotaro!   Jojo!   Good one, huh?   I'm only playing with you,good ol' Jotaro.   Kakyoin... It's likehe's a totally different person!   That look again!   What's with all this hardcore glaring,   Jotaro, old pal?   Get in, Kakyoin.   The cable car just got here.   Now I told you to get in.   See, I've got your ticket right here.   I'm gonna knockyour crooked, possessed ass    right into that cable car!    What?    You're a bit off.    "Possessed" isn't quite the word.    This isn't Kakyoin!    You still haven't realizedmy body's been growing    this whole time, have you?    All right, who are you?    Is he a Stand?    But I was able to touch him just now...    Unless he's a StandI can strike with my own fists?    Jojo!    I can merge withany organic matter I consume.    I'm a Stand anyone can see and touch.    I'm Yellow Temperance,of the Temperance card.    Gaze upon my handsome face with envy!    Come on, Jotaro, old pal!    Take a look at your hand.    See that little bit of me?It latched on when you hit me.    But I'm warning you:    Touch it, and it'll go afteryour left hand, too.    You should save your left handfor picking your nose!    This Stand is a slow eater...    And the more it eats, the bigger it gets.    You'll never get it off!    Damn you...    Oraa!    What do you mean, "oraa"?    When I digest you,    I'll shove your own crapdown your measly throat!    This stuff burns.    You bastard...    Hey, is this Jojo's grandpa?He's in big trouble!    Anne? What's wrong?    It's Mr. Kakyoin...    Kakyoin?    So he has betrayed us?    Mr. Kakyoin's face split open!    But Mr. Kakyoin wasn't Mr. Kakyoin!    And...    Jojo got att*cked bysome weird slime on the cable car,    and it's eating his finger!    Calm down! Where are you right now?    The boarding area forthe cable cars at the trade center!    He's being att*cked!    Mr. Kakyoin is attacking Jojo!    Hurry and come back to the hotel...    Did someone say my name just now?    Where have you been?    Jojo left me behind,so I was sunbathing by the pool.    With your uniform on?    Yes, why not?    It's all right.We have the real one here with us!    Anne, that means your Kakyoin is...    a fake!    I've been telling you that!    Jojo!    Jojo just jumped out of the cable car!    STAR PLATINUMJOTARO KUJO    Good grief.    A Stand that fuses with flesh?    It's devouring my finger...    But first things first,I've gotta get this thing off me.    Worst case,I might have to chop off my finger.    Think you got away?    Sorry to burst your bubble, pal.    Now dig that earwax out ofyour ears and listen up, hotshot!    My Stand, Yellow Temperance,has no weaknesses.    You didn't escape.    I just have no need to chase you!    You're as good as dead!    This'll hurt like a sonf a bitch,but it's time to torch it off.    This...    It only made it grow!    That was a bad idea...    Damn.    Pardon the intrusion.    My, my. That's certainlya bizarre entrance.    Don't mind me.    Hey, there kid.    I'm gonna need to borrowyour popsicle for a sec.    Excuse me, young man!    What do you think you're doingwith that child?    This your kid?    No, he's not, but...    Then shut up and enjoy the ride.    Sorry, kid.    When we get to the bottom,I'll buy you a new one, okay?    'Kay.    If I can't burn it off...    That bastard!    Now it's forming needles anddigging deeper into my hand!    Come now! Nothing will work,not even fire and ice!    I told you, before, didn't I?You won't find a single weakness.    You're mine, you little sh*t!    You're...    Papa! The puppy! It got our puppy!    Bastard! You were waiting for mein this cable car, weren't you?    M-My precious Pocky!    Watch out! Don't pull him!    Let go!    I've come to put an end to you...    Jotaro, old pal!    Oraa!    Pretty fast! But...    I keep telling you,I don't have any weaknesses!    Are you even listening?    You dumbass redneck!    My Stand is armorthat can also absorb power.    A defensive wall that can also att*ck!    No matter how fast orhow strong you may be,    against Yellow Temperance,you are helpless!    You can't defeat me!    You can't survive unless, of course,    you take a cleaver to your right hand!    Do you understand?    You have no way of winning!    You're not getting out of this!    Not until you're digested!I'll eat you up!    Good grief.    You're right, you reallyhave no weaknesses.    Maybe you are the world's strongest,    and that's terrifying.    But I'll tell ya, we Kujo's...    No, I mean, we Joestar's...    we use strategy to fight our waypast any obstacle.    I still have one strategy left.    What?    And that's to...    And that's to...    ...run away!    What the hell?    You're in the middle of beingeaten alive, you dumbass!    My Stand's got a hold of youthat you can't escape,    and you say you'll run away?    When I said run away...    I meant into the water!    I can't breathe...    You let your Stand's guard downto take a breath, didn't you?    Your Stand may be invincible,    but if I butcher you,your Stand dies, too.    Do you understand?    Listen, I've had it up to here withthat cocky-ass mouth of yours.    You should know,    I'm the kind of guy whotakes these things to heart.    Oraa!    Please, stop...    I can't fight anymore, I'm through!    My nose is completely shattered.    They're going to have towire my jaw shut, too.    Dio paid me to do this.    I didn't plan on risking my lifeto go after you guys.    There! See?    I want something from you.    The other Stand users,I want all the info you got.    That's the one thing I can't talk about.    I do have some pride, you know.    I can't rat them out...    Well, okay then. That's honorable.    Oh, I remember now!    Death, The Empress, The Hanged Man,and The Emperor are after you!    So, what can they do?    I don't know.    No, honest! I really don't know!    Stand users never revealtheir abilities to each other.    If they did, they'd be exposingtheir weaknesses outright.    But I do know that some witchtaught Dio about Stands...    Her son is one of the fourcoming after you.    His name is Centerfold.    He's unmistakable becausehe has two right hands.    And his card is The Hanged Man.    He's the one who k*lledPolnareff's sister, right?    I've heard the occasional rumorabout his powers...    A mirror. Apparently, he uses a mirror.    I haven't actually seen it,    but Polnareff has no chance of winning.    He's dead meat.    I just noticed something, Jotaro...    Looks like I've still gotsome luck on my side.    See that drain over there?    The one with all the blue crawdads?    Take a real good look.    A manhole...    That teeny little drain    is hooked intothis manhole right beside me!    I'm gonna pull you in and trap you!    Now you can't att*ck me!    I guess what I told you aboutthe man with two right hands    will go to waste.    Jotaro Kujo!    Aren't I lucky to havethis drain pipe to slurp you into...    Man, am I lucky!    Time to power up with some crustaceans!    I'll mash you up    and turn you into jelly!    And when I do, Dio's gonna give mea hundred million dollars.    A few minutes of brawling with you,and I will be set for life!    Aren't I lucky,you ball-less little buttmunch!    Good grief.    When you're focused on everything else,    it's difficult to observe yourself.    You just don't get it.Your luck finally ran out.    Before, you got awaywith only a broken nose.    Now you'll be lucky if you haveany bones left to break!    He punched me with water...from inside the drain?    I was only kidding around, Mr. Jotaro!    I swear, I was just messing with ya!    Just a little prank.    Come on, don't tell meyou took that to heart?    You're not thinking of punching meany more, are you?    I'm seriously injured here...    My nose is broken and my jaw'sgonna have to be wired shut...    I've got nothing left to say to you.    You're way too pathetic    I'm done wasting my breath.     YELLOW TEMPERANCERUBBER SOUL    Good grief.    So we're finally on our way to India.    And the man with two right handsis called Centerfold...    By the way, where did Anne run off to?    She was hanging around Singapore Station    right before our train departed, but...    I'm sure it was time for herto meet her father.    That story about her dadsounded real fishy to me.    I bet she's a runaway!    But it is a bit lonely withoutthat little rugrat, right, Jojo?    It's eerie...    To think, a Stand coulddisguise himself as me.    Seems he had already turned intoyou by the time I left the hotel.    Jojo, are you going to eat that cherry?    Not to be greedy,but they are my favorite.    Could I have one?    Yeah, sure.    Thank you.    Hey, look, Jojo. Flamingos in flight.    Oh, good grief.    Jojo...    My wallet's already been stolen!    No, thank you!    Tip!    If you don't give me a tip,you won't go to heaven, Mister.    Hey! Don't put your nose on it!    Avdol! Is this India?    Yes! Isn't it a great country?
