02x28 - Anubis, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:43Any improvement withyour injuries, Avdol?  Yes. But I am relieved to knowyou will be all right, Kakyoin.  Well I...  Luckily my cornea wasn't damaged,  so they expect meto make a full recovery.  I remember whenI was in middle school,  and my classmate wasstruck by a baseball  directly in the eye.  It turned out he wasfine the next day.   The eye only lost a bit of fluid.   Are you serious?   No!   The bandages will come offin a few days.   I'll catch up with you later.   It's less than     kilometersto Cairo... and Dio.   Everyone, you must be vigilant.   Hmm, what language isthis hospital bill in...   Arabic?   Man, it's so confusing!   The   is supposed to be five...The decimal is zero, and seven is a six?   And this wormy-looking one is...   A four. So, the amount we owe is...    Forty-six thousand three hundred fiftyEgyptian pounds?    That's insane!    He's adorable!   What is he I wonder?   He's so funny looking!   What in the world?He's chewing gum.   He must be waiting for someone.   Such a good little doggy!   And here I thoughthe was waiting outside.   Good grief.   So he's a hit with ladies, is he?   I wonder why he's chewing gum.   What a weird little puppy.   Um, hello?   Let me give you some advice.You'd best step away from that dog.   He may seem charming,   but he basically hates people.   If you're not careful,he'll make your--   Damn mutt!Get off of m--   -You stinking...-Ew! He tooted!   He's so cute!   You get along so well.   We don't get along at all!   Damn it, Iggy! Get off of me!   Catch you later, lovebirds.   Mr. Joestar?   Hey, hang on!   You...   You nasty little mutt!    In ancient Egypt,the dead were always buried    on the west bank of the Nile,where the sun sets.   That's why all Egyptian citiesstand on the east side of the Nile.   On the west, you'll findgraves and mortuary temples.   But our enemiesdon't care about east or west.   They'll come from all directions.   Your cows are far too lazy.   They're strong, though,I'll give them that...   Chaka! Get a move on!   Stop falling behind!   Damn it!   What kind of man are you?Are you really my son?   Your cows and your sonare just like you!   A sword?   What's it doing here?   Hey, look! It's a sword!   Give me that!   What? Someone must've dropped it.   Amazing someone left it!   This is incredible!It must be worth a fortune!   Hey, maybe the owner'sstill around.   He must've been in a major panic.   You don't think, it mightbe some kind of artifact?   Are you going toturn it in to the police?   Idiot! This could fetch usloads of money!   But I found it...   But if it's blunt,it won't be worth anything.   Come on! Pull it out.   Right!   What's wrong?   It won't come out!It won't budge!   Give it to me.   Here.   Hold that end.   Right.   It's no use.   The blade hasn't movedone centimeter!   Let me have a try.   Shut up!   How are you going to do it,if I can't, idiot!   My hand!   My hand! This gaping wound!   How? How did it cut me?   The blade wouldn't even come out!   The only thing I grabbedwas the hilt!   There's something strangeabout that sword...   Um... How about if I try now?   Fine! Go aheadand try already then!    It just came out.    But I didn't putany effort into it.    What...    I can hear the blade ringing...    I don't know much about swords,    but I've never seen a bladethis beautiful.    It's like a Japanese katana!    It glistens, like it's cloakedin ice-cold water...    What an amazing find!    Hey! Give it to me!You shouldn't be holding it!    Hand it over!    Hey, wha...    Why did you do it?    I don't know...    You were standingbehind me, Father.    It's not my fault...    What are you doing?Hurry!    We have to take him to a doctor!    This sword is evil!    It's like it has a mind of its own!    Be calm.    Let your heart grow still, Chaka.    Their deaths mean nothing.    Who are you?    I can't see you,but I hear your voice...    I am the Stand of the God Anubis.    Ruler of the underworld...    Deity of embalming,Lord of the dead...    You have unsheathed me.You shall be my Stand user...    You are my flesh!    You are a virtuoso.    I shall make you masterof the sword.    No one is stronger than you.    Wield me, and k*ll!    Father and that manboth deserved to die.    I think I'll hack youto pieces, too.    What?Hey, Chaka, stop!    Please stop!    Impossible!    The cow's unharmed...    Slaughter Joseph!Slice Polnareff!    Cleave Jotaro in two!    You are a fighting genius!A master of the sword!    No one is stronger than you!    The world is no matchfor your blade!    Kom Ombo?    Do we really have timefor this place?    Quit moaning.    They've allowed us passageon their ferry.    We must show our respect.    Come on, I'm starving!Let's get something to eat.    You never stop, do you? Here.This'll tide you over for now.    That's Iggy's!    Don't worry about it.Just take it.    By the way,where can I find a bathroom?    Shall we investigate?    Hey, mister, over here.    Want to buy some papyrus?    Papyrus is the original paper!Want a piece of Egyptian history?    Look, look! It's real papyrus!    Papyrus?    I'll give you a good price.    It's the real thing?    Of course, my friend.    A famous Egyptian craftsmandrew this.    Hm...    It's a fake. Real papyruswould never rip so easily.    You can't fool me.    Huh?    Where is Mr. Joestarand the others?    Huh?    Iggy? Why, you little...Hold it!    Hey! Where's my money?    That stupid dogjust gave me the slip...    Hey.    That's a pretty ballsy move...    Preparing to att*ck mewith so many people around.    Guys like you are rare.    Stand users don't usuallyshow themselves,    let alone facetheir attacker head-on.    It's quite noble, really.    I didn't think any of youwere like that.    Tell me your name.    I am Chaka.    My Stand is Anubis,Ruler of the Underworld.    Jean Pierre Polnareff,your life is mine.    My life is yours?    You certainly don't mince your words.    Your boldness is impressive,I must say.    Bring it on!    Let's see what your so-calledAnubis Stand is made of!    Chariot!    He's holding a sword, but...    Is he really going to fight me withthat instead of his Stand?    Something's strange.    His movements...That grip...that stance...    They're the hallmark of an amateur!Something's strange.    I need to be careful.    I need to keep my distance.    ANUBISCHAKA    What the hell?    The sword passedthrough the pillar.    And my shirt too!    He cut me withoutcutting my shirt!    I would've been k*lledif I hadn't stepped back.    You bastard! Chariot!    Stop hiding, and show... yourself!    Crap...    How could I? I lost him.    He could be hiding behindany one of these pillars.    His sword can pass through solid objects.    And my Chariot's striking rangeis only about one meter...    Damn!He's tougher than I thought.    I can't believethis jerk is giving me a run for my money    in sword fighting.    But you won't havethe advantage for long!    All right, Chaka, old pal!    Try and att*ck me now!    You can't sneak up on meif I'm not behind a pillar!    You're not gonna pop up outof the ground, are you?    What?    The pillar...    My sword need not passthrough objects!    I can cut throughthe pillar itself!    Die, Polnareff!    That was close.    Even Jotaro doesn't knowabout that technique.    Silver Chariotcan launch its rapier.    I have one chance only.    If the opponent dodges,I'm done for.    I use it only as a last resort.    No, I didn't k*ll you,    but I don't thinkyou'll be fighting again.    That's strange...    The sword's back in its scabbard.    Did it just slip back in by chance?    Now that I see this sword up close,    I see its beauty.    I must unsheathe it...    Hey, Polnareff. There you are.    You worried us,going off like that by yourself.    We thought you'd been ambushed.    Polnareff?    Huh? Oh.It's you, Mr. Joestar.    My mind's so fuzzy...    Maybe it's frombeing tossed around,    or maybe it's fromall these wounds.    Polnareff, why are you squatting?    You step in some poop?    Wait? Where'd you find that sword?Did something happen?    Yeah...I was just fighting that jerk.    What? An enemy Stand user?    It's over now.    He said his Standwas the god Anubis.    It was a Stand that couldphase through objects and cut them.    He was a powerful opponent.    "But, of course,he was no match for me."    Polnareff reassured himself.    He att*cked me with this swor--    Huh?    It's gone?    Rats are runningoff with the sword!    Hey!    Talk about creepy...    So rats steal stuff here?    If you want to steal,go steal some damn cheese!    That's odd...    Now the sword's stuckin the scabbard.    Polnareff!    I'm glad you're all right,    but don't ever run offby yourself again.    It's too dangerous!    They'll att*ck if you'realone for even a few seconds.    Oh, no! That's our ship!    Let's hurry.We need to get to Edfu today.    Wait. Hey!    Polnareff...    So you brought the sword?    I'm turning it in to the police.It is a dangerous w*apon.    Good, we can't take any chances.    Who knows who mightpick it up at those ruins.    Besides, it's likely to beextremely valuable.    Hey, Iggy! Quiet!    We could get kicked out of here!    What the hell is with you today?    Well, since this damn dogwon't shut up,    I think I'll take thisto the cops now.    Polnareff! I thought we told younot to go off on your own!    I just told you!Jotaro, go with him.    Right.    Hey.Shouldn't we get to the police station?    Oh, come on!    A man's got to lookhis best, right?    Oh, right.    Excuse me, would you putthis sword over there?    Certainly.    That thing's a dangerous w*apon.    Anyway, I was rolling around a bitand got kinda dirty.    Make this handsome face gorgeousagain will you, Mr. Barber?    Certainly.    Ow...    Hey, watch it!That razor's dull.    Sharpen that thing!    This is supposed to bethe most relaxing part!    Good grief.What a prima donna.    That so? My apologies.    Good!    Much better.Now that's a shave.    So very... glad to hear, sir.    TrÃ¨s bien!    Now under my chin, too.    Certainly.    Right here...    under your chin, yes?    Under the chin!Right, Polnareff?    What?    It's me, you fool.The Anubis Stand!    Grr!    The sword itself is a Stand!    I won't lose to someoneI've faced before!    He's strong...    The more I fight him,the faster his att*cks become.    The look in Polnareff's eyes...    I'll have...    your head!
