Lower.  Oh yeah, that's it.  But not too hard, mind you.  -Mister Joestar?-Hey, what's the matter?   It feels likesomeone's tickling my back.   I can't concentratemuch longer like this!   Mister Joestar!   Looks like we've gotquite the c*ptive audience.   Mister Joestar, keep your voice down!   People are staring!   They'll think you're crazy!   You think I'm screamingfor the hell of it?   -Oh, no!-That poor man...   Let's give him some change.   Why are they throwing money?   Older relatives like thatcan be tough.   That is so true.   Kakyoin, go buy the TV.   Let's get out of this crowd.   Right.   Is this your store?   Uh... Yes it is...   I'd like to buy that TV.   Unbelievable...   Kakyoin's Hierophantand Polnareff's Chariot   shrunk themselvesto a microscopic level   and infiltrated Joestar's body.   They intend to fight me?   I can see them!   They're traveling throughthe bloodstream   and heading towardthe brain stem to my Lovers.   Quickly!   We don't have longbefore the flesh bud   in Mr. Joestar's braineats clean through!   Hurry, you two!   There!   All right!   Do it, Mister Joestar!   Hermit Purple!   These are...   the flesh bud's tentacles!   We finally made itto the brain stem,   but the flesh bud'salready taken over!   Damn it!   It's him!   Look!   He's using those weird clawsto knead Mr. Joestar's brain cells   into a gooey mash so he canfeed them to the flesh bud!   We have to destroy him and tear outthe flesh bud's roots quickly,   or they'll completelydevour his brain!   Okay!   I'll julienne him to ribbons!   You know on second thought.   A finer cut should do the trick!   Like grating a radish!   No you don't!   Now!   He did it!   No, not quite!   Gotta say, Kakyoin,that thing's pretty fast.   But I've already figured him out.   If that's all the little beast has,then he's no match for--   Polnareff!   Who are you talking to?   Huh?   Polnareff, that's not me.   And that's not a Stand you slashed!   It's melting away!   What?   I'm The Lovers!   Polnareff!   He disguised himself!   He was wearing Mr. Joestar's brain!   Somehow that thing usedthe kneaded brain cells   to disguise himselfas my Hierophant Green!   All you destroyed was a decoymade of those brain cells!   And you dummiescompletely fell for it!   Come on!   Pull your head out of your ass!   Better shine these shoes right,Jotaro!   I'm in a fantastic mood, you know!   So until these shoes shineas bright as I feel,   and I can see that bright sunon them, clear as day,   I'm gonna need you to polishyour little heart out.   If you'd like, you're welcometo use your uniform.   Actually, why don't youuse your tongue?   Hey! You bastard!   What are you writing?   You're looking at your tab.   And you're gonna pay in full.   I wrote it down, so I won't forget.   You're a scoundrel, Jotaro.   Well, it doesn't matter.   It'll all be meaninglessin the end.    Kakyoin, look!    Check out the decoy's headI just opened!    What the hell's going on?    He's splitting into two!    Listen up.    To win in life,one must thoroughly know oneself!    It's like Aesop's fable    when the unassuming tortoisebeats the hare.    The tortoise outruns the hare    because he knows his abilitiesbetter than anyone!    Of course,the same applies to me.    I know perfectly wellI lack the power and speed    to mortally wound either of you.    But remember this!    The spoils belong to thosewho admit their own weaknesses!    Emerald Splash!    Did it work?    More decoys are formingfrom the brain cells.    They're multiplying!    But a person can haveonly one Stand,    which means only one is real!    Where's the real one?    Right here!    Emerald Splash!    Close but no cigar!I was standing right next to--    The more decoys we hit,the more they multiply!    No, no...    It's me...    They're all me!    Polnareff, that's enough!    Withdraw your Stand now.    I can't just watch you get hurt,even if you are trying to save me.    No way in hell!    I can't standthe thought of giving up    and watching you die like this.    Withdraw your Stand!You'll be k*lled!    Do as I say.    It's over.    We fight to the end, Mister Joestar!    I can't tell...    They're all the same!    Which is the real one?    Which is the Stand?    I can't tell them apart!    The world's weakest Stand is...    The most...    the most powerful of all!    Hey now, Jotaro, look!    A beautiful gold bracelet.    Pretty impressive, eh?    It'd make any girlfall head over heels.    Jotaro,    see that space there in the glass?    Use your Standto sneak through and steal it!    Steal it.What don't you understand?    Get a move on!    I mean...    I don't mind breaking the glassand taking the bracelet myself.    Then again, if I'm caught,I could be beaten to a bloody pulp.    Old Joseph would surelydie from the pain.    Hurry it up!    While the salesman'slooking the other way!    This guy's shoplifting!    Son of a--     THE LOVERSDAN OF STEEL    Mister Salesman!    Please, sir!Don't let him get away!    Sure thing!    You bastard...    All right? Where's the thief?    Who's the culprit?    That guy, there?    That Asian kid?    Ya know, back where I come from,    when someone steals somethingwe chop off their fingers!    Hey, Jotaro.    You better not use your Standagainst civilians.    Punk!    Take this!    Despicable!    Dirty thief!    Now get the hellout of our country!    Good-for-nothing assh*le!    We'll let you off easy.You can keep your fingers for now!    That was great!Nicely done, my friend!    Thanks to the commotionyou caused,    I was able to get my handson an even better piece!    Jotaro!    What the hell are you laughing at?    What's so damn funny?    Nothing.I'm just a bit excited.    I was laughing 'causeyour punishment just doubled.    And I've been waitingfor this moment!    It's almost payback time,and it's really got me tingling.    Why, you!    It would seem we have somethingof a misunderstanding.    Sorry, but your Old Manisn't long for this world.    That's the reality you're facing.    How sad.    You don't know usvery well, do you?    I see you don't knowKakyoin at all.    Come again?    It seems to me you're obsessedwith the notion of knowing oneself.    It makes sense.    I suppose I'm inclined to agree.    To know oneselfis an important lesson.    But so is "know thy enemy."    You should have done your homework.    Can't you see?    My Hierophant...    has the powerto stretch out its feelers!    I've been inspectingevery one of you!    How could I've not noticedsomething touching me!    So you're the Stand!    Emerald Splash!    Success!    Well, well...    Looks like Kakyoingot you pretty damn good.    I'm wondering...    Will I get my paybackonce he's done?    He's realizedhe's out of his league!    He's trying to escapeinto the artery!    He's trying to escape!    He's trying to escapefrom Mr. Joestar's brain!    Huh? Did you say he's leaving?    All right!That's great news, isn't it?    -Mister Joestar, hurry! The flesh bud!-Right!    Overdrive!    The flesh bud's vanishing!    Thank God.    This whole experience sure has donea lot to bring us together.    You're incorrigible, Polnareff.    Hold on a minute.    If that thing's really tryingto leave my brain.    It'll go backto its Stand user, Dan of Steel...    The bastard is returning to its user!    This is bad!    Jotaro has no way of knowing!    What's wrong?Why are you backing away from me?    Aren't you going to tell memore about my grandfather's death?    Hey...    What's with the big hurry?    Got somewhere to go?    You're not actually tryingto run away, are you?    After all you've done...    Please, Jotaro, sir, forgive me!    I admit it, you win!    I'll change! I'll lie on the groundand lick your boots!    I know what I did was wrong!    You can pummel meas much as you'd like!    Hit me! Kick me!    But please, don't k*ll me!    Soon,    very soon,the Lovers will return to me!    And this idiot, Jotaro,doesn't have a clue!    This time it'll infiltrateyour brain!    Kakyoin is hundreds of meters away.Just you wait!    I'll make you sufferpain so horrible    you'll wish you were never born!    It's here!    Now! Enter his ear!    I figured you'd trysomething shitty like this.    Don't you know my Stand,Star Platinum,    has superior eyesight and reflexes?    Didn't you check up on us at all?    I wasn't planning anything!    Not againstyour Stand's immense power.    Did you just say "Your" Stand?    Just "your"?    No! I meant your awesomeand powerful Stand    is far superior to any other!    I knew I didn't stand a chance,so I had it come back!    Please look!    You've already shatteredmy arm and leg to pieces!    I can't possibly fight anymore!I can't even move!    Yeah...    All the crap you did to me,    I guess an arm and legshould make up for it.    Do you swear you'll never showyour face to us again?    I swear!    I'll head for some deserted island!    I'll go to the ends of the earthand never return to bother you!    You'd better not be lying.    The next time I see that face,it'll get a thousand punches.    I'm not lying!I'd never ever lie to you!    Get lost.    Let's play soccer over there!    But then I can't play!    Jotaro!    You're an utter fool!    Just take a look at that girl!    My Stand, The Lovers,just went into that girl's ear.    Now he's heading for her brain.    You'd better not move, Jotaro!    I'm going to s*ab youin the back with this Kn*fe,    and make sureyou never move again!    att*ck me with your Star Platinum,    and this girl's pathetic lifeends right here and now!    You'd never allow    such an innocent child to die,would you?    Oh, good grief.Go ahead and s*ab me, then.    Hey! Didn't you hear me?I said don't move!    Don't...    What? Huh?    What's the matter?    Didn't you say somethingabout stabbing me?    Like this, right?    My body won't move! Why?    What's this thingwrapped around me?    I see you didn't notice.    Kakyoin tied Hierophant's tentacles    around the legof your fleeing Stand.    They stretch all the way backto him like a kite string.    Guess you weretoo self-absorbed to realize it.    Please forgive me!    Ask for forgiveness from Enyaba,the woman you k*lled.    I never had the slightest intentionof forgiving you.    Dio paid me to do this.You can have it all.    Good grief.    You really are a piece of work.    What you owe me,can never be paid back with money!    Your receipt.Keep the freakin' change.     JOTARO KUJO    I have this feelinglike someone is staring at us,    so I keep looking back.    Are you sureyou're not just being paranoid?    I can't help but feelthat presence, too.    I really can't shake the feelingthat someone's staring at us.    Something's strange.
