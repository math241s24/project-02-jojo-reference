02x12 - The EmpressQuotePostby bunniefuu Â» 01/11/23 08:33My son has been m*rder*d...  I can sense the misfortune thathas befallen my son, Centerfold.  The bond between motherand son has spoken!  My precious, beautiful boy...  You d*ed covered with wounds like this?  I can feel it.I suffer the same pain you felt.  You were magnificent as you foughtfor LordDio, my dear Centerfold!  How...  How did they do it?   To k*ll such a nobleand pure soul like you...   They must have done something underhanded.   Damn them!   The bastards!   I will make sure they paya terrifying price   with the Empress card!   Move!   This is a time for action...   With the Stand that brings a slow death!   Oh, the anguish!   I shall k*ll them all!    VARANASI, CALCUTTAINDIA   Jojo and crew head tothe sacred city of Varanasi.   Listen...    I don't usually get ona soap box like this...   But stupid people are just that.   You can repeat something a million times,   and they still won't listen.   You know the type, right?   There's just no helping the poor souls.   But you know, uh...   I never got your name...   Nena.   Nena! That's a great name.   Daughter of that wealthy Varanasian family   from around here, right?   You're good-looking,and I can tell your smart, too.   I have an eye for people,which leads me to my point...   Hol Horse is a horrible, lying bastard.   He's manipulating you!Think how your parents would feel.   You hear me?   You can't end up like this.   I know it's easy when you're in love.   But you can't afford to seethe world with such a narrow view.   Take a step back andlook at the whole picture.   Hey, we're almost there.   The city of Varanasi.   The sacred river, the Ganges.   A place for holy men,the young and the old, the sick.   Where cows, dogs, monkeys,and food for human consumption,   lie alongside excrementand corpses for cremation...   The river embraces all,its waters ever flowing.   From birth unto death,   its holy waters form a microcosm of life.   Visitors of Varanasiare said to remain transfixed,   never wanting to leave.   Perhaps the landscape   that is this sacred landis a window unto soul.   Man... This thing isn'tgetting any better.   What's wrong, old man?You don't look so good.   Looks like my bug bite got infected.   It's definitely swollen.   I think you should see a doctorbefore it gets worse.   Hey, doesn't that sort oflook like a person's face?   Stop kidding around, Polnareff.   Sorry 'bout that.   Shall I go to the hospital with you?   No! Stop treating melike a feeble old man.   I'll just lance this.   Huh? What'd you say?   It's definitely infected.   It'll worsen, if we don't drain the fluid.   Hey, hey, hey.   Can't we just put medicine anda bandage on it, and call it a day?   Not to worry.   We'll numb the area, so it won't hurt.   No problem. No problem at all.   Come now, lie down.   I studied medicine in England.   I can do appendectomies, too.   Uh-oh. It's a little rusty.   Well, no problem.   All right.   Let's slice it open.   Come on!   I don't want to watch it being cut open.   No problem.   Hey, are you done?   Is it over yet?   What?   Hey, Doctor!   Trying to cut me open?   That's a pretty stupid move, you old fart!   What the hell is this?   I'm the Empress,   as in the Empress card, Old Man Joseph!   And now, I'm gonna bloody you up good!   When'd you get on me? Damn it!   This thing's got teeth!   Damn it's strong!    No, it grabbed the scalpel!    Oh, no!    Thank goodness it got my artificial hand.    Bastard! Think you can just cut me?    I'm part of your body now, Old Man Joseph.    You can't get away from me, honey.    Bet I can guess what's goingthrough that thick skull of yours...    Probably something like...    Only a Stand can defeat another Stand.    My Stand, Hermit Purple,has the power of clairvoyance    and remote viewing.    How can I fight with that?    How can I defeat somethingthat's growing out of my own arm?    You can't!    Where's the user?    How the hell did you infect me?    You moron! I won't tell!    Disgusting freak!    Running off to your friends?    We'll see how that goes.    Doctor, your next patient is waiting...    Doctor...!    Hey! Let me explain!    -I didn't do it, I...-I k*lled him!    I'm Joseph Joestar! An American!    And I'm staying at Hotel Clarks!    What?    By the way, girlie.    I have a thing forhot young nurses like yourself.    What?    m*rder*r!    Wait! You got it all wrong!    Oh, no...    Now you can't go back to the hotel.    You're all alone now!    I can k*ll you without anyone interfering!    You little...!    I'll crush you to tiny bits!    What?    Hey, this is your arm.    Take care of it, you shitty old man.    It grew arms? How much more could it grow?    Hey! Let go of it!    What are you doing? Let go!    Not a chance!    Officer! The m*rder's over here!    He's right here!    It's been a while since it came to this...    Hey! What are you doing?    Overdrive!    Moron!    It's your arm, remember?    You think your Hamon wouldwork against your own body?    You! Don't move!    Then how about...Hermit Purple!    You're crushing me...    I can use it this way, too!    I told you, freeze!    Stop! Criminal!    Damn it!    What are you doing? I can't see!    Now what?     HERMIT PURPLEJOSEPH JOESTAR    So as I was saying, Nena...    Real men don't have to talk a big game.    That's how you figure out who's a liar    and who's the genuine article.    Damn cops've run mein the wrong direction.    I'm nowhere near the hotel now.    Had I known this would happen,    I would've taken Polnareff with me.    Instead of a petty guylike Hol Horse, how about me?    Am I not your type?    I don't dwell on the past.    I don't care whom you used to date.    What's important is the future.    We just need to understand each other.    Oh, look over there.    That place is a hotel run bya Japanese woman named Kumiko.    -She manages it-Out of the way.    -with her Indian husband.-Out of the way.    We could probably stay for cheap.    Oh, really?    Tell me more about this hotel.    Wha...    What the hell are you doing?    I'm eating, Joestar.    I've got to grow up big and strong.    You stole those at the market!You quick little bastard.    Why, you...    Look how big I've gotten!    It's tough having another mouthto feed isn't it, Daddy...    You disgusting little cow!    I'll show you that nobody...    has the experience or the smarts totake down the great Joseph Joestar!    Now how the hell am I going to do that?    Damn it...    Here goes nothing... Hermit Purple!    Oh, Daddy Dearest,    you know I appreciateall your tender loving care.    But you shouldn't tie your children down.    One day, you have tolet them leave the nest!    Oh, no!    It's no use.    I could use Hermit Purple'sremote viewing to find the User,    but I need a camera!    What can I do?    At this rate... it won't be just my arm.    She'll take over my entire body!    I've already grown enoughto end your pathetic life!    See? I can reach your throat.    I just have to bust your carotid artery,    and you're done for.    Oh, no!    What's he doing?    Bastard!    What in the...?    Look!    That man has a verystrange growth on his arm!    Dammit! Where the hell's the Stand user?    Polnareff, sir...    I need a reliable man like youto take care of me.    I love you... Such a strong,trustworthy man you are.    Uh, but it's all so sudden.    Is she serious?    I think I'm falling in love!    Lucky!    Hey, Joseph Joestar.    You idiot.    You getting farther and fartherfrom Jotaro and the others.    You think I'm running my ass offjust for the hell of it?    I'm running so I can shut you up for good!    See that?    You're going in for a nice long soak!    Senile old fool!    A nail?    I picked it up earlier.    When you were rolling aroundon the ground like an idiot.    Now I can cut shove itright into your carotid!    Did you actually believe I'd suffocate    if you stuck me in here?    Die!    I may be made of your flesh,but I'm not alive like you!    Forget the rules already?    Only a Stand can defeat a Stand.    Oh yeah,    weren't you going to show meall that fighting experience?    Am I supposed to be impressed?    You're nothing but a pathetic old man!    My prosthetic hand...    It almost broke when she hit it earlier...    It's got no power!    Just one more push...    Your life as an invalidis about to come to an end.    There's no way you can defeat me...    Huh?    Not a single way...    What?    Not a single what?    I'm sorry, my hearingisn't what it used to be.    Run that by me one more time, will ya?    Coal tar!    You stuck me in tar?    It wasn't to suffocate me!    You were trying to keep me from moving!    But...    How'd you know there wascoal tar in there?    With my Stand's power,Hermit Purple told me everything!    Hey, everyone look...    What is this?    That foreigner must've made itwhen he spilled the incense ashes...    They've formed a perfect map of the city!    You used psychic photography!    That's how you found the tar!    You "developed" a picture in the incense!    The difference in our fighting experience    should be as clear as day now!    When your opponent starts boastinghe's already lost.    That's how Joseph Joestar does things.    Like a fine wine,I guess I just get better with age.    Now...    It's time to rip off this Standwith my Stand!    Next you'll say,"Please, stop it, I beg you!"    Please, stop it, I beg you!    This will hurt me as much as it hurts you.    But children can't dependon their parents forever.    Once you've grown up,    you gotta learn to live on your own!    Now then...where's this thing's Stand user?    Well, then, Nena...    Shall we seal our new love with a kiss?    What? What? What the hell?    What's wrong, Nena?    So she was The Empress's Stand user...    Huh?    Huh?    This ugly troll...    attached her Stand to meas a tumor with a human face,    and camouflaged herselfas a beautiful woman.    You were careless.    She played you likea damn fiddle, Polnareff.    EMPRESS NENA    And here I thought we'd finallybe able to sleep in a bed.    If the old man hadn't screwed up,    we wouldn't be out herehiding from the cops.    I took care of things.    We can take this car.    Polnareff, you're driving.    Hey, don't tell me you're still in shock.    The Stand att*cked me, remember?    I'd rather have gone through that...    NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW    So, we're finally leaving India.    Well, I am a girl.    Did you see the driver's face?    More trouble would be especially bad now.    A truck? Impossible...    By the way...do you like sumo?
