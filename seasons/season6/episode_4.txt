05x04 - The Visitor (2)QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/29/23 08:13Tomorrow at noon, you will have a visitor. But you must not meet him. You must not go to the visitation room. Someone's here to see you. Turn around. Go back to your room! Dad… Johngalli A. This man was behind it all. Johngalli A. is, without a doubt, a Stand user. Just know that you are being targeted. I'll get you out immediately. My handcuffs! When did I get free? Jolyne, get away from that door! Star Platinum: The World! Time, stop! What happened just now? Stay still! The fight has already begun. Aerodynamics. It detected our positions using aerodynamics. Do not make a move until we understand the contraption. Don't order me around. -I know that! -You… FE! Who do you think you're talking to? You bastard! Jolyne! -You… -Don't move! Keep your voice down. It'll detect our position again. Johngalli A. uses that Stand to read the airflow. It may even react to the change in our breathing. Plus, that Stand can be used remotely. He can sh**t at that Stand to reflect the b*llet to his target. It's a sniping Stand. We cannot att*ck Johngalli A., who is in the men's prison. We have to destroy that long-range Stand. Any damage dealt to the Stand is reflected on its user. I'm well aware. The problem is, the moment we move to prompt an att*ck, the Stand will detect our position and Johngalli A. will sh**t at us. Stay by the wall, Jolyne! It's detecting your location! Jolyne, what are you thinking? EPISODE : THE VISITOR () Your own muscles cannot be trusted. When skin comes in contact with a breeze, the muscles have a twitching reflex. This is an a*t*matic reflex you cannot control. Therefore, I use my bones to affix the r*fle. Bones land firmly on the surface. The g*n is as stable as the surface itself. Its stability is something we can trust. Meteorologists may argue that the direction of drafts cannot be predicted. That may be true, but only to an extent. Is this fly flying randomly? No. It flies while smelling things nearby and feeling the air current. The wind is the fly's movement. Just as the guard said, Jotaro Kujo is here. He's here to see his daughter, Jolyne Cujoh. The descendant of the Joestars is in the visitation room at this very moment. Within range of my ability, Downtown Transfer. Joestar… Joestar! My life will finally begin after I eradicate your family's blood! You will pay for robbing me of the one who was my rock! I see. You said we have to destroy it, right? Look at its movement. It can't detect the wind due to the precipitation. Now's my chance! Stone Ocean! No, wait! Look closer! It's evading every drop of water. It's reading the drops' air current to avoid them. Jolyne, go back to the wall! He's going to sh**t at us! This isn't good. Once the guards arrive, the air will stir! -Hey, listen! -What? Hurry, move the base of the pillar! Kick it with all your might! -But you're… -Don't worry about me. Got that? Please don't forget what I said. I want you to survive! I don't know why, but there's a descending hole between the walls. It seems to be a passage. Maybe it leads to the sewer or the vent. What is this? It may lead us to the outside. Let's go, Jolyne. Seems it's our only option. -It flew away… -No. It's still close. It's looking for the perfect angle to snipe us. No… It's following the boy on the other side of this door. He plans to hunt the boy because he helped us escape. Jolyne, go down the hole! I came to break you out! Before I entered this room… he grabbed this arm of mine. I'm sure of it. I can't believe it, but he's here. He was just an ordinary kid like you'd see at any park. And we don't know each other… We're complete strangers. But… he grabbed my arm with desperation in his eyes. The warmth of his hand even felt as if he cared about me. I'm going back inside. Before he sh**t the boy, I'll k*ll Johngalli A.! Good grief. To the visitation room! That's where the fire alarm went off! There are no cameras there. -Be prepared to engage! -Where did he go? That boy… How does he move through this place, appearing and disappearing out of nowhere? Hurry! To Visitation Room B! Did that boy dig this hole? This wall… So he used this! His height is about cm. His build is small, almost like a child's. I don't know who he is, but the hole that suddenly opened is a vent. I know where it leads by reading the air. However… I can't have this small guy guide Jotaro and his daughter deep underground where I cannot reach them! I will not lose those two again! I'll finish this small one first! Jolyne, our situation is too dire. Our Stands are only good for defense at the moment. Should we strike, Johngalli A. will read the movement of the air. This is too dangerous. Hey, you! You can't just leave the room! This side is the prison! -Good grief. -Leave from the other side! What the… There it is! Just as I thought, it's chasing the boy! But there aren't any windows here. How can he aim through the men's prison? No… However… This boy… Look at him! How smart! No, we're blessed! With his body submerged completely underwater, the air is unaffected! And, he's inside a pipe! Johngalli A. cannot find him now! Not only that, there are no windows down here. Surely he can't sh**t him now… The pipe is bursting! But how? Where is he aiming from? Could he be… Distance to the target is m. The b*llet drops .cm while airborne, and there's a slight ocean breeze of . meters per second. The b*llet will drift by .cm to the left. Finding its target. Targeting his heart. sh*t! Stone Ocean! Threads! Jolyne Cujoh… This is her Stand ability! She followed the boy down? Is she an imbecile! She thinks her net can stop my b*llet? Changing my target to Jolyne Cujoh. Targeting the forehead. Now, sh**t! How? I'm so glad I broke this pipe beforehand. The moment I came in, I punctured this gas line. Gas is lighter than air. It creates a layer of gas separate from oxygen. I thought it would obscure your aim. Man, was I right. How did she do this? You're too late! You're mine now! Stone Ocean! Seems you couldn't read your own fate. STAND NAME: DOWNTOWN TRANSFER STAND MASTER: JOHNGALLI A. Who are you? How is a child like you roaming freely about this prison? I hit myself. This bone. That's right. You gave me this. What is it? It looks like a bone. What's going on? You tried to stop me from going to the visitation room. Just what do you know? Hey, answer me! Not yet… I can't, yet. You mustn't let that go. This smell. Is this your doing? That sn*per guy, Johngalli A., his Stand? It was nothing once I got to it. I pounded it into a thousand pieces. I see. It seems you're quite used to fighting with your Stand. Not out of choice… There he is! Right there! He's on the move! Hide! He has a r*fle. He's hiding behind that pipe. I saw him going above the t*nk! That's impossible. He was targeting from the men's prison, which is  to m away. There are layers of bars between us. Not only that, he is almost completely blind. How do you suppose he traveled so fast? How the hell should I know? If I said he's here, he's here! Hide! He's directly above you! All right, I believe you. And get ready. The gas must have been accumulating. We did it! Hey, we're safe now! What the… Where did he run off to? Are you hiding? You don't have to be afraid anymore. Come out and explain what's going on! What are you doing? I'm looking for the boy. Did you see where he went? I don't understand what you mean. What boy are you talking about? Oh, I see. You didn't see him, did you? I was talking to a little boy outside the visitation room. Johngalli A. tried to get rid of him first. Get rid of him? What are you talking about? You came here on your own. And so I followed you. Hold on, our stories aren't matching up. You must have heard his voice. No, I know you did! He's the one who told us about the secret passage! You were there with me! Did you hear a ghost or something? I don't know of a secret passage. Damn you! You're messing with me at a time like this? You're here now because you followed me down the secret tunnel… Hold on… Something's not right with you. Your wound… You were sh*t. What happened to your wound? Wound? The b*llet wound from when Johngalli A. sh*t you! On your right shoulder. But you aren't bleeding, and your clothes… I don't have a scratch from being sh*t either! This man… He isn't Johngalli A.! He's the prison guard! But I saw him get sh*t through the head! His head is unscathed! What do you mean he was sh*t? And who is Johngalli A.? What's going on? Something's amiss. It's not adding up! What is this? A fate more terrible than death will await us all. You must not go to the visitation room. The visitation room… That's right. Something was off from the very beginning. When was I uncuffed? And that b*llet… Was I really sh*t back there? But my dad and I don't have a scratch. Was Johngalli A. attacking us to begin with? Something's wrong. Nothing is making sense! This isn't reality! I'm in a dream of some sort. No, I'm under someone's spell! This is… A dream… Was I… dreaming? Since when… It looks like I did knock out this prison guard. This photo of Johngalli A… Dad showed it to me. The accident with the hitchhiker. I heard that it was all a plot to imprison me. That was all real. And then I tried to leave the room. That's when I noticed I was uncuffed. That was the moment. No, I was sitting down when I awoke. So before then… We haven't stepped outside of this visitation room. In other words… Johngalli A.'s Stand was an illusion my mind created. The secret passageway too. The moment we stepped into this visitation room, we fell under their trap and were forced to dream. As if engulfed by a python, slowly but surely, we're being melted to the bone! The boy in the garbage can who gave me this bone. He was real! I was able to wake up because I cut myself on this bone! Without the pain from the cut, I would have stayed asleep. This ability is Johngalli A.'s att*ck! My thread! I can't unravel it, not even for a few centimeters! This is bad! Dammit. I'm getting sleepy again… We need to get out of here. Out of this visitation room! Stone Ocean!
