02x27 - Khnum's Oingo and Thoth's Boingo / Khnum's Zenyatta and Thoth's MondattaQuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:43Ah, new pages...  they came.  The brothers Zenyatta and Mondattatook a bus four hours later...  So they managed to avoid gettinginto an accident. Yippee!  What adventures await them now?  Once in Aswan,they made their discovery:  "Oh! There they are!"  "The five bad guys!",cried the brothers.  But the brothers wondered,"What are they talking about?"   The bad guys seemed so worried...   It's them.   Little did they know. They haddrunk tea laced with poison. Gulp!   Zenyatta...    So all I have to do is poison them.   Mondatta, you and Iare invincible together.   With your clairvoyant comic Stand...   and my face Stand...   my transformative ability...   They're as good as dead!    Our cards are Thoth,God of Writing,   and Khnum, God of Creation!   We're the ZenyattaMondatta brothers!    EPISODE   KHNUM'S ZENYATTA AND THOTH'S MONDATTA   In this café,   at that table... This is wherethey'll drink their poison tea.   My Stand, Thoth,the God of Writing, never lies.   So, how are they?   Luckily, Avdol's major arteriesweren't damaged,   so he'll probably bereleased tomorrow.   But Kakyoin's injuries are serious.   He could go blind.   I'm worried about him.   I hate to say it, but we might haveto leave him behind.   Hey, look at all these cafés.   We could all use a break.Let's get a drink.   Sounds good. Which one?   My cigarette says that one.   Welcome.   What would you like?   Let's see... How bout some tea.   Same.   Yes, sir.Three teas, coming right up.   No, scratch that.   -Huh?-Listen. We're in enemy territory.   This is Dio's dominion.   Who knows whenour enemies will att*ck.   We have to be more cautious.Someone could easily poison us.   From now on, we drink onlyfrom bottles and cans.   What? Are you serious?   I am serious.   Hey, forget the tea.We'll take coke instead.   Coke?   Yeah. Something wrong?   No. Okay. Coke, right?   Okay, three bottles of coke then.   Oh, and we'll open them ourselves.   Give me the third, fourth,and fifth ones from the right.   Now they want Coke?   How am I supposed to put poisonin an unopened coke...   Was the prediction wrong?   No, my brother's comicis always right.   I have to believe!I have to believe Mondatta!   If I can't stand behindhis predictions,   we won't have a chance!   Brother, my predictionsare foolproof!   Hey, you! This Coke's warm!   Is this your idea of a cold drink?I'm not paying for this, idiot!   Hey, the Coke's not cold?   The fridge is down so...   You're being paranoid.   Even if that guy was our enemy,   and even if he was tryingto poison us...   how would he have knownwe'd come to this cafe?   This city has tons of cafés,and I chose this one on a whim.   I could understandif this was the only café,   but there are tons of them.   My point iswe can't be too careful.   If you're that worried,let's go somewhere else then.   Let's go to the oneacross the street.   All right.   -Fire!-Huh?   My café is on fire!   Some fool left a burning cigarettein the road.   It ignited the trash!   Hey, sir.We'll take three teas after all.   We won...   But...   What kind of jerk would tossa lit cigarette near the trash...   They're drinking it!   Drink it all...   -They drank it!-They drank it!   A dog took my cake!   Who the hell broughta dog in here?   -Iggy...-Iggy...   Whose dog is this?   Hey! Get that dog outta here!   Damn it, Iggy!   Get back here, you!   Damn it! They were just aboutto swallow the poison!    sh*t! What's supposed tohappen next?    It hasn't come yet...    But the comic wasn't wrong.    Thoth sees the near future.    Next time we'll get them...    We'll k*ll them withthe next premonition!    That's right. We're...    the Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!    "That darn dog! We failed!"    "We were so close!",fumed the brothers.    Zenyatta and Mondattawere very mad.    But they didn't give up.    Zenyatta and Mondatta followedthe three guys and their dog.    While following them,    they met a man who had a facethat really made them angry.    It was exactly the kind of facethe brothers hated.    Something must havehappened to me in a past life    to hate guys like this...    It really pisses me off.He deserves a knuckle sandwich!    He was a perfectly nice man,but Zenyatta punched him anyway!    The man with the bad face ran away...    and left a wallet full of money.    "Yay! We're rich!    We're so lucky! Whoopee!"cried Mondatta.    What a fool.    We're rich!    Ah! Brother, another page.    The brothers continuedtheir pursuit.    The bad guys got in their carand headed to the hospital    to see their friendsAvdol and Kakyoin.    Zenyatta made a b*mbout of an orange    and planted it in the car.    Jotaro was blown to bits!    His head was split in two,and blood splattered everywhere!    Look how clearthe comic came in...    Yes!    KHNUMZENYATTA    My Stand, Thoth,can see only the near future.    But once the prediction's printed,it can't be changed! Ever!    Jotaro will blow up!    The b*mb will detonatethree seconds    after he sticks his finger into peel it.    It's destiny!    There's no way out!    -Who's there?-Wha--    Who's in our car?    It's not Jotaro?    No. Jotaro said he was goingstraight to the hospital.    -Be careful!-Crap...    Don't let him get away!    Crap! It's Joestar and Polnareff!    Hey, stop hiding in there!    Who are you? Come out.    I said come out, damn it!    Hurry it up!    Hey, what's the matter guys?    It's me, can't you tell?    Oh, it's you, Jotaro.    My Stand, Khnum,is a transforming Stand.    I can alter my height, weight,and scent to whatever I want.    I used my hairto recreate this hat!    But what happened?    You said you were goingstraight to the hospital.    Huh? Um, uh... Right, the hospital.    I forgot something, so I came back.    My wallet.I left my wallet in the car.    Good grief.    Jotaro, what happened toyour school uniform?    School uniform?    What? School uniform?    That's really nota good look on you.    Oh, my outfit.I mean my school uniform...    It's at the dry cleaners!    I took it to the cleaners,and didn't have any money.    That'll convince them. Yeah!    Huh. I see...    Then get in the car. Let's go.    Huh?    Huh? The car?    It can't be...    It can't be!    If I get into the carwith this face,    that means the real Jotarowon't get blown up! It'll be Me!    Impossible!    Nah, actually,I think I'm going to walk...    There isn't time, Jotaro!    It'll be fasterif you just get in the car.    Zenyatta!    Crap...    I've got to undomy Jotaro disguise,    or I'll be the onewho gets blown up!    That's it! I just need tothrow it away!    I'll get rid of this one    and put it back in the car later,    so it can blow up the real Jotaro!    I did it!    There! Now I'm safe!    Hey, it's Iggy!He's chasing our car.    He's got an orange in his mouth!Did you steal that, Iggy?    That'll make a nice giftfor Kakyoin and Avdol.    Wha-- Yow!    -"Yow"?-"Yow"?    I never thought I'd hear you saysomething like that.    You're acting strange.    No... Yow. You know, yow.    I was saying there wasa cyow over there...    Jotaro... You are actingpeculiar today.

Crap! Damn that Jotaroand his stupid party tricks!    If I don't do it...    they'll really thinksomething is up.    They're already suspicious of me.    And Polnareff is about toset off the b*mb!

And if I don't undo my disguise,    I'll blow up just likethe prophecy said!    That's it! I'll just pretend I'm sick.    I'll make them let me out ofthe car to relieve myself!    Jotaro, the way you'reclasping your hands...    You've got your left thumb on top!    Dammit!    Does Jotaro always clasp his handswith his right thumb on top?    What kind of person notices that?    What am I going to do?    That just proves you were a womanin your past life!    Since I put my right thumb on top,    I was a man in my past life!    Wow, really?
