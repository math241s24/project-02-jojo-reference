02x40 - D'Arby the Player, Part 1QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:56What the?Something's coming this way!  I don't know who you are,but you're no ordinary human!  Polnareff!  And I'm gonna end you!  A playing card?  Welcome. Master Joestar,we've been expecting you.  I am the butler of this house.  My name is D'Arby.  D'Arby?   Yes. My name is D'Arby Younger.   The D'Arby whom you defeated,   is my older brother.   You're D'Arby the gambler'syounger brother?   So you're hereto avenge your brother?   No, certainly not.I would do nothing of the sort.   Did my brother not sharewith you his motto?   "The deceived, not the deceiver,holds the blame."   It is an adageI hold dear, as well.   My brother lost.He is the wrongdoer.   I hold no grudge against you.   My brother is my brother.And I am me.   We are two different people.   My brother and Iare ten years apart.   I did look up to himto a certain extent,   but we are of different generations.   My brother tried to winby deception.   He is old-fashioned.   He could win against onlythe outmoded and the inexperienced.   Master Dio realized that as well,   which is why he kept me by his sideand made me his butler.   Is something wrong?   If you wish to fight me,   then I invite youto enter our manor.   Stay on guard, everyone!   We don't have time for games.Take us to Dio!   Jotaro! Be careful!Something's coming out of his body!   D'Arby Younger. His Stand, Atum.Atum of the Egyptian pantheon.   Hey, he brought out his Stand!   We haven't seen this in a while.   So another Standthat actually shows itself.   So who's first?   Who shall be my first opponent?   Forget that!   Jotaro, take him down!   I'll bet youStar Platinum will first att*ck   with his left arm.   His first att*ck will be a punchthrown with his left arm.   -How much do you bet?-This is bullshit!   It won't makea difference either way.   One punch is all it takes!   Do it!   Hit him, Jotaro!   What? He dodged it?   Such amazing speed!   That's impossible.   Ah, too bad.It seems I lost the bet.   Like my brother,I enjoy a good bet.   But, alas,luck is never on my side.   To apologize, I shall take youto a wonderful world.   What the? A pit?   Blast it! It was all a trap!   Jotaro!   Jotaro's falling into the abyss!   Pull him out!   I suppose I have no choice.Join us.   Mister Joestar! Kakyoin!   Wait! It's too dangerousto go in after them!   Avdol, can you hear me?   If you don't hear from usin ten minutes,   torch that mansion!   Understand, Avdol?   Mister Joestar!    EPISODE   :DARBY THE PLAYER, PART     Is this an illusion?Are we underground or above ground?   This water feels so real.   What is this?   Just what is he trying to do?   Old man, Kakyoin,see if you can figure this out.   His Stand knew without a doubtI would throw a right punch.   Have any idea why?   If we don't figure it out,we'll lose this one.   Care to wet your whistle?   The drinks are real.   And I assure youthey are not poisoned.   Are we inside the mansion?   Yes.   Where in the mansion are we?   I cannot tell you that.   -Are we in the basement?-Perhaps.   Is a Stand doing this?The illusion?   Yes.   Is it your Stand?   No.   -Is it Dio's?-No.   Whose is it?   I'd rather not say.   The Speedwagon Foundationhas reported   that there are two to three moreStand users.   Is that true?    I'd rather not say.    You're not being very helpful.    I could lie,    but unlike my brother,I prefer not to resort to trickery.    So what you're saying is    if we don't defeat you,we can't proceed?    Exactly!    Absolutely correct, my good sir.    That gentlemanly demeanoris beginning to get on my nerves.    Remember, it's three against one.    We're short on time,    so you'll have to deal withall three of us at once.    Come now, take a load off.    I have something to show you.    This is my collection.    Collection?    Like my brother,I'm a humble collector.    Every collector yearns to sharehis treasured trinkets    for that ephemeral momentof praise, does he not?    Is he a...    Dolls? But why?    No, Kakyoin.    He's D'Arby's brother.    Those aren't ordinary dolls.    D'Arby!    Talk to me. Please, talk to me.    Talk to me!    I'm so lonely!    Help me!    Oh my God!    They're alive!These dolls are alive!    You bastard! You took their souls!    My hobby is making dolls.    Course,    most doll makers cannot imbuetheir handiwork with human souls.    I suppose I may begiving too much away,    but that is my Stand's ability.    My brother's collectionis rather boring.    All he has are simple coinsmade of souls.    With my collection,you can play dress up    and have actual conversations.    -Meet Sonia.-D'Arby!    She can wax poeticabout her many passionate love stories.    She has such exquisite skin,doesn't she?    Anyone would be proud to own her.    Dr. Elliott is a serial k*ller.He's k*lled eight people.    He'll tell you all aboutthe patients he's exterminated.    I made the glassesand stethoscope myself.    Oh, and how could I forget!I must show you this!    This is Tatsuhiko,a video game expert from Japan!    He was a formidable opponentwith an IQ of    .    It wasn't easy b*ating himand stealing his soul, though.    You're just as sickas your brother.    No, you're even more sadistic.    I'm losing all patience!    Beneath that polite façadeis a deranged sociopath.    You make me sick.    By the way,I'm sure you learned this    when you fought my brother,    but the human soulis a mysterious thing indeed.    The moment a person admits defeat,    the soul losesalmost all its vitality.    At that very moment,I can rip out a person's soul!    That is our Stands'fundamental mechanism.    I've heard enough!No more Mr. Nice Guy!    We'll knock the living daylightsout of you,    and get the hell on our way!    But you must listen!    Jotaro! You already knowyou're under my control.    Remember, Jotaro,when you tried to att*ck me,    and I knew exactly which armyou would use.    Shocking, wasn't it?    You still haven't figured it out!    You were shaken,and while only slightly,    I was able to touch your soul.    What do you think I didwhen I touched your soul?    What?    What is that?    I embedded Atum's handinside your soul.    I could crush your right armand make Master Dio very happy.    But if I did that,    I wouldn't be able to defend myselfagainst Kakyoin and Joseph,    and I would perish.    I certainly don't want that.    So I have a suggestion, gentlemen.    Let's play a gameand bet our souls.    What?    If you b*at me,I will let go of your arm.    Good grief.Already under your control, huh?    You're going to regret this, D'Arby.    I would love to hear youutter the words,    "I'll bet my soul on this game."    And I have another humble request    Kakyoin, you shall bemy first opponent.    Hey, what do you mean?    You should fight me first.    Mr. Joestar and you are family,but Kakyoin is not.    I'd prefer Kakyoin not back outand att*ck me with his Stand    after I've taken both your souls.    Damn, arrogant prick.    assh*le thinks he's won already.    Fine. I'll be your opponent.    -What?-Kakyoin!    It's fine. I'm not worried.    I've probably played morevideo games than anyone here.    I challenge you to F-Mega.    I'll bet my soul!    Good.    Kakyoin!    You don't have to go first.    Yes, I do.    The hand in your arm could hinderyour game-playing ability.    D'Arby,    how do I knowyou'll release Jotaro if you lose?    The TV, console,and game cartridges are all good.    It's an ordinary video game setup.    I am not like my brother.I do not cheat.    Now, let's begin.    Yes.    Go ahead, and select your vehicle.    Right.    So, I see you picked #  .    I will be #  .My birthday is January  th.    We can begin whenever you please.    Cut the courtesy and start!    Race start in...    Five!    He's button mashing the acceleratorat such an incredible speed    He's trying for a turbo start!    Three!    -Damn! I don't have time...-Two!    ...to do the same!    He'll take the lead!    One.    Start!    He blocked me!    As long as I'm in fronthe can't b*at me.    It's impossible for him to pass.    And unfortunately for you,    I never make mistakesduring a race.    It's over, Kakyoin!    What?    Kakyoin, you've playedthis game before, haven't you.    I'd rather not say.    All right!This is your chance, Kakyoin!    Hurry up! Get your machineback on course and start!    That technique...    You don't get these skillssimply by playing video games.    I never guessedhe'd make such a bold move.    They're tied! They're side by side!    No. Kakyoin is on the outside.    He's at a disadvantageon the turns.        kilometers per hour,    ,    .    Three seconds till the first turn!    I can't turn at this speed!    I'm entering the turnat full speed!    Two! One!    They're synchronized!    They turned at the same speedat the same time!    They're neck and neck!    I like you, Kakyoin!    Your soul is on the line,but you're unflinching!    You've conquered your fear!    You will make a worthy additionto my collection.    Noriaki Kakyoin thought to himself...    Conquered my fears?    Thank you.I haven't always been this way.    Six months ago,when I met your master, Dio,    he planted a flesh bud in my brain,    and I was terrified.    I still remember.    I remember the horrorof facing that monster.    My legs wouldn't move.Every hair on my body stood on end.    I was frozen.    I realized I was helpless.    The mere sight of him was turningmy own body against itself.    My stomach was in knots.    I could taste bilein the back of my throat.    I nearly threw up.    Dio gazed down at me,    and said tenderly,as if calming a child...    Kakyoin.    There's nothing to fear.    Let's be friends.    I curse myself! I heard his words.    And I was relieved.    Totally and utterly relieved.    "I can still live!", I thought.    But it was humiliating.I'll never forgive him!    It was humiliating beyond words.    I'll never forgive myself.    I curse myselffor submitting to him.    Jotaro saved me.    That's why I decidedto embark on this journey.    I will never againallow myself to become    the pathetic, cowardly KakyoinI was on that fateful day!    And that, D'Arby, is why I can fightwith my very soul on the line!    Three, two, one!    They're neck and neck again!    The third corner!    That is why I, Noriaki Kakyoin,    will never be controlledby my fears.    That, I promise you!    All right! The fifth corner!In sync again!    They're both turningat the same speed!    Kakyoin! Damn you!    The sixth corner is coming up!    The speed tunnelcomes right after the sixth turn.    If you enter the tunnel,    you can doubleyour max speed to    km.    I've got to make it to the tunnel!    The tunnel is wide enoughfor only one car.    If they try to enter the tunnelside by side,    one of them is going to crash!    Sixth turn!They're still neck and neck!    The tunnel! I see the tunnel.    Kakyoin, push'm aside!    Haven't you realized, Kakyoin?    Do you really thinkyou can push me aside?    Look at your power meter!    Kakyoin has less power!    You used up your power    when you spun aroundand blocked me    back at the beginning of the race!    Two seconds untilwe reach the tunnel.    You're going to crash!Let him have the lead!    Go in the tunnel behind D'Arby!    I can't do that!    If he makes it to the tunnel first,there's no way I can win.    One second!    Kakyoin!    He went on two wheels!    Dammit!You're riding the tunnel walls.    Yes, Kakyoin! You can do it!    Push'm aside!    Quiet! You're ruiningmy concentration!    He's slamming into Kakyoin!    I don't care if I lose some power.    I need to get around that turnfaster than Kakyoin,    even if it's only a hundredthof a second sooner.    I need to get out of the tunnelbefore him, even if it means    I'm just one one-thousandthof a millimeter ahead!    Hey, what's wrong?I can't see the cars!    From here on, we have to get throughthe tunnel in darkness.    What?    Absolute darkness,where the radar is completely useless!    And there are eight turns,a landmine, and a cannon att*ck.    It remains darkuntil you're out of the tunnel.    One mistakeand you'll slam into the wall.    But I know exactlywhere the turns are.    And I'm sure D'Arby does too.    That's the cars turning.    What's happening? Where are they?    Who's ahead?    Three!    Two!    One!    Cannon att*ck!    For a second there,the blast lit up the cars!    Kakyoin is slightly behind.    The exit!They're about to exit the tunnel!     D'Arby is ahead!    He's one car length ahead!    I win!    I will never let down my guard.    You have less power than I!    I've grasped his soul!    Don't be ridiculous, Jotaro!    I know the rules of baseball.    It is impossible to back out now!    You should offer encouragementat times like this.    This is pathetic.
