Eh?Nara: Y-You ate them, didn't you, Mista?!Nara: Give them back, damn it!Mista: And what the hell do you have on your mouth?Nara: Huh?Nara: Ah!Mista: "Ah," my ass! You little sh*t!Nara: S-So sweet!Mista: When did you stuff them in your mouth?Fugo: By the way, I didn't thank you yet, did I, Giorno?Fugo: For grabbing the water.Gio: Something's... bizarre...Gio: I don't know what,Gio: but something's strange.Abba: Hey, you bastard!Abba: Didn't you hear that the boss ordered us not to set foot on the is—Abba: ...land?Nara: Huh?!Gio: This isn't normal.Gio: Something weird is going on!Gio: This isn't good! Bucciarati!Abba: Where do you think you're going, Giorno?!Bruno: Is that you, Giorno?Gio: Bucciarati!JoJo-main: ,Yes, I know he's on the move.Gio: I know exactly where the boss is because of the brooch you put on him.Gio: Right now, he's at the bottom of the stairs to the charnel house.Gio: He's right by the pillar that's about two meters away from the stairs.Gio: But wait, Bucciarati!Gio: Something is wrong!Boss: Bucciarati, your mission to act as Trish's bodyguardBoss: has now come to an end.Boss: Wh-Why, you...Boss: He's trying to immobilize my arm.Bruno: Zipper Man!Boss: But... Emperor Crimson has already...Boss: ...seen through it.Boss: Your movements in the future.Boss: The trajectory of your movements in the future.Boss: Within Emperor Crimson's ability, this world's time disappears,Boss: and no one remembers the movements they made within this segment of time.Boss: The clouds in the sky don't realize they've broken apart.Boss: A flame that's extinguished doesn't even realize the moment it went out.Boss: All that remains in this world are the results.Boss: In the world where time has been eliminated, all movement becomes pointless!Boss: I am the only one who can react to these movements.Boss: I can see every single one of your movements!Boss: This is Emperor Crimson's ability!Bruno: Th-This ability...Boss: No matter who you may be,JoJo-main: ,everyone goes through their ups and downs.Boss: You succeed, and you fail.Boss: But if you happen to find the pitfall known as the future that's right in front of youBoss: and manage to not fall in,Boss: you will never experience a setback in your life.Boss: You will remain in your best condition.Boss: Don't you think so?Boss: Now that I've actually met you, I can tell that we are indeed related.Boss: I can sense that you are, without a doubt, my daughter.Boss: Which means...Boss: When you are awake, you will feel the exact same way toward me!Bruno: Trish...Boss: I must fill any pitfall that threatens my path!Boss: I will now sever this bond of blood that binds us!Bruno: Trish!Crunch,Sfx: {\c&HEFFF&\c&HAEE&}DogyuuuuunCrunch,Sfx: {\c&HEFFF&\c&HAEE&\clip(m   l      )}DogyuuuuunBoss: Wh-What?!Bruno: That must be Giorno...Bruno: Giorno's Golden Wind's ability...Bruno: He planted the turtle's cells in the brooch and gave it life,Bruno: and a turtle with Stand abilities was born.Bruno: Since our call was interrupted, he must've sensed something was wrongBruno: and activated his ability.Bruno: He always gives me courage...Bruno: I didn't think I could move anymore, but... Not yet.Bruno: I still...Bruno: have to keep moving a little bit more.Bruno: My mission's done? You're wrong, Boss.Bruno: It's still ongoing!Bruno: As for Trish...Bruno: I will protect her on my own order!Bruno: If he can read all of my att*cks,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,and I can't even realize that he's dodged them,Bruno: then his ability surpasses all others in its invincibility.Bruno: But...Bruno: This ability doesn't allow him to read one's movements for long!Bruno: It's only a short time.Bruno: It seems to be around five to ten seconds.Bruno: Distance...Bruno: For now, I need to get as far away as possible!Burno: I need to get far enough that the boss can't find Trish!Bruno: I beg of you to keep moving, body.Bruno: Don't let me waste this chance that Giorno gave me!Bruno: Until I can get out of this basement...Boss: It seems there was another traitor.Boss: Must be the newbie.Crunch,Sfx: RumbleBoss: If my information is correct, I believe his name is Giorno Giovanna.Crunch,Sfx: RumbleBoss: So he must've joined this organization with the intent to betray me from the start.Boss: It seems you thought you could escape just by distancing yourself from me,Boss: but it's nothing for me to escape that turtle an instant sooner.Boss: It appears that your efforts were futile, Bucciarati.Boss: How are you still able to move?JoJo-main: ,Sheer willpower?Boss: If you just rest, you won't be able to get to the first floor,Boss: but you'll be able to die peacefully.Boss: First, I'm going to eliminate Trish.Boss: Don't you dare move, Bucciarati!Bruno: The chance that Giorno gave me wasn't in vain!Bruno: If this is going to be about reading each other's moves,Bruno: I've already read yours!Bruno: I knew before you fell into the sewerBruno: that you'd probably use your ability to escape!Bruno: Now, Zipper Man!Boss: Emperor Crimson!Boss: That was close...Boss: But within Emperor Crimson's world,JoJo-main: ,your efforts are still futile!Boss: Take this!JoJo-main: ,You're finished!Bruno: It wasn't you that I was trying to att*ck!Bruno: It was this pillar!Bruno: Zipper, close!Boss: What?!Bruno: As I thought... Your ability is invincible...Bruno: But it appears that you can only read movements for a short time.Bruno: You're not reading ahead of time.Bruno: Just try and read my future movements, Boss.Bruno: Try to figure out what I'm going to do in a few seconds.Bruno: Try to see beyond time.Bruno: You should be able to see meJoJo-main: ,after I've reached the first floor.Gio: Bucciarati! Trish!Gio: This wound...Gio: What happened in the basement?!Gio: Where's the boss?Gio: He should still be around...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Somewhere close by.Gio: I don't know the whole situation, but there's no wayJoJo-internal/narrator: ,the boss is just going to let Bucciarati go after this!Gio: Bucciarati...Gio: N-No...Gio: Bucciarati!Gio: His pulse...Gio: I-Impossible! It's gone!Gio: I created the parts needed for his recovery!Gio: Bucciarati, please breathe!Boss: So this must be Giorno Giovanna.Boss: His unknown ability gave Bucciarati the chance to escape.Boss: However...Boss: I will not let them get away!gio: This is impossible!JoJo-main: ,I know I created the parts!Gio: There's no way he shouldn't have a heartbeat!Bruno: Giorno, it's me.Bruno: Call Abbacchio and the others.JoJo-main: ,Get out of here.Gio: That voice...Bruno: I told you to call Abbacchio and the others.Bruno: Get out of here!Bruno: Out of this church!JoJo-main: ,Hurry!Gio: B-Bucciarati!Gio: Th-Thank goodness!JoJo-main: ,You're okay!Bruno: Hurry! Hurry up and call the others!Gio: B-But...Bruno: We can't figure out who the boss actually is right now.Bruno: We need to get out of here, Giorno! While we're still far enough from him!Boss: They're within my range!JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Here I go!Bruno: I'll explain later! Hurry up, Giorno!Gio: Golden Wind!Nara: Giorno's over there!Abba: Hey, Giorno, you bastard! Come back here!Abba: How are you gonna make up for disobeying orders and stepping onto the island?!Mista: Bucciarati's here, too!Nara: H-How the hell did you get so injured?!Fugo: Why do you still have Trish with you?!Abba: What's going on here, Bucciarati?Bruno: I'll explain everything later.Bruno: Right now, we need to get out of here as fast as we can.Boss: I commend you, Bucciarati.Boss: I commend your precise and keen decision making.Boss: Even though I have the ability to eliminate time,Boss: if I were to face all six of those Stand users,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,one of them would end up learning my true identity.Boss: For the moment,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,they've managed to escape my Emperor Crimson.Boss: But this is not the end.Boss: I will never...Boss: let you escapeBoss: from Venice!Bruno: Now I understand why the boss is feared by everyone and how he ruled over all of us.Bruno: We can't defeat the boss... not now.Bruno: As for his identity...Bruno: Assuming it even has one,Bruno: we'll need to find his ability's weakness first!Sign: Emperor CrimsonMista: What...Abba: What the hell's going on, Bucciarati?Abba: We need an explanation.JoJo-main: ,What the hell are you doing?Bruno: All right. I'll just come out and say it.Bruno: But I can't explain everything right now,JoJo-main: ,because there's no time and danger's right around the corner.Bruno: The reason I brought Trish backBruno: is because I betrayed the boss just now.Bruno: I'll be leaving you guys now.Bruno: If you go with me, you will also become traitors.Mista: Wh-What?Nara: I-I don't think I heard you right...JoJo-main: ,Wh-What did you just say?Fugo: He said... he betrayed the boss.Fugo: B-But why?Bruno: You probably shouldn't hear any more,Bruno: because you guys have nothing to do with this.Giorno: I think you should explain.Giorno: Some of them might want to follow you.Gio: We need people on our side.Abba: What the hell is your deal, Giorno?!JoJo-main: ,First, you go into the church without permission, and now—Nara: Bucciarati!Gio: What's wrong? Are you all right?Bruno: I'm fine.JoJo-main: ,I lost a lot of blood, so I got a bit dizzy.Gio: That shouldn't be possible...JoJo-internal/narrator: ,When I created his parts, it should've also replenished the blood he lost.Gio: Did I miss a wound?Bruno: I guess I've used up a good deal of energy.Gio: Does he not feel pain? There was no blood coming from the wound, either.Gio: Was I just seeing things?Bruno: I'm sorry.Mista: You had me worried for a sec!Abba: For real.Fugo: Bucciarati, please...Abba: Yeah, Bucciarati.JoJo-main: ,We want to know the details.Bruno: The boss had us act as her bodyguardsBruno: so that he could k*ll his daughter with his own two hands.Bruno: Because she shares his blood, she could have figured out his true identity.Bruno: I found that out and...Bruno: I couldn't forgive him.Bruno: I couldn't just come backpretending I didn't see that.Bruno: That's why I betrayed him!Fugo: How could you?Mista: Are you insane, Bucciarati?Abba: You know exactly what happens to traitors,Abba: no matter who it is.JoJo-main: ,The boss never lets anyone get away!Abba: Hell, Venice could already be surrounded by the boss's elite guard!Bruno: You're right, and that's why I'm going to need help.Bruno: If any of you are willing to accompany me,Bruno: come down these stairs and get on the boat.Bruno: But I will not order any of you to come with me.Bruno: I won't even ask you to come with me.Bruno: I did this all on my own.Bruno: So you don't need to feelobligated to come with me.Bruno: This may come off as arrogant, but I'm going to say it anyway.Bruno: I did this because I believe I'm right.Bruno: I have no regrets.Bruno: Despite the world we live in, I want to continue on the path that I believe in.Bruno: If we can just find his weakness...JoJo-main: ,Though we're only fleeing for now,Bruno: I will defeat the boss, no matter what.Bruno: I will find his weakness, no matter what!Fugo: I understand your reasons, and what you did was right, Bucciarati.Fugo: But I'm going to be blunt...Fugo: I hate to say it, but no one's going to get on that boat.Fugo: How could you let your emotions take over like that?Fugo: I owe you my life, but going with you now would be a different matter.Fugo: You've lost sight of reality.Fugo: No one can survive in this world on expectations alone.Fugo: We can't survive without the organization.Abba: Fugo's absolutely right.Abba: What you did is basically su1c1de.Abba: No matter where in the world you might run to,JoJo-main: ,you'll never find a safe haven again.Abba: Besides, I pledged my loyalty to the organization.Abba: It's not like I pledged my loyalty to you.Abba: That being said...Abba: I never had a home or place I wanted to go.Abba: The only time I'm ever at easeAbba: is when I'm with you, Bucciarati.Giorno: Abbacchio...Fugo: Y-You can't be serious, Abbacchio!Mista: If we actually manage to defeat the boss...Mista: Considering my skills,Mista: I'd say I'm next in line to become a capo.Mista: Bucciarati's smart.Mista: He never goes into a fight that he has no chance of winning.Mista: We're gonna strike it rich for sure.Fugo: Mista! Not you, too!Mista: What are you going to do, Fugo?Fugo: You've all l-lost your minds!Fugo: We're going to be completely isolated!Fugo: Where are you going to run to?JoJo-main: ,No, you won't even make it out of Venice alive!Gio: Narancia,JoJo-main: ,what are you going to do?Nara: I-I... d-don't know what to do...Nara: Tell me, Bucciarati...Nara: What should I do?Nara: Do you think I should go?Bruno: Are you scared?Nara: Yeah... I'm r-really scared...Nara: B-But just order me!Nara: If you order me to go with you, I'll be more confident!Nara: Nothing scares me, as long as you order me to do it!Bruno: No.Bruno: This is one thing I can't order you to do.You need to decide for yourself.Bruno: You need to choose your own path.Nara: B-But I don't know what to do! I don't know!Bruno: But let me just give you this warning.Bruno: Don't come with me, Narancia.Bruno: You're not cut out for this.Fugo: Are you serious about this?Fugo: You'll be k*lled, without a doubt.Fugo: There are some things in this world that you just can't do, even if you're right.Fugo: Our job has always been dirty.Fugo: How is this any different?Bruno: Even then... I can't lie to myself.Bruno: Let's go!JoJo-main: ,Once the boat takes off, you're officially traitors!Fugo: Why? You're insane!Fugo: All this for a woman you just met and barely talked to!Fugo: You don't even know what kind of music she likes!Nara: Trish was abandoned by the people she trusted...Nara: I was also abandoned before.Nara: I was abandoned by my dad and the friends I trusted.Nara: We're sort of alike...Fugo: It's none of our business what the boss does with his daughter!Nara: Trish and I are sort of alike!Fugo: All he had to do was close his eyes! I just don't understand!Bruno: Giorno, give me the turtle.Bruno: Let's put Trish inside it.Giorno: Okay.Gio: Bucciarati, please turn around.Nara: Bucciarati!Nara: I'll go! I'll go, too!
