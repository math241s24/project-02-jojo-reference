02x35 - D'Arby the Gambler, Part 2QuotePostby bunniefuu » 01/11/23 08:47Before we get started,there's something I want to check.  Shuffle those cards.  They're shuffled.  What now?  Draw a card from the deck.  It doesn't matter where.  Just make sureno one else sees it.  OK.  I'll tell you which one it is:the six of hearts.   I'll name the cardsin order from the top.    Five of spades, queen of diamonds,jack of spades, ace of hearts,    seven of diamonds, six of clubs,king of clubs, two of diamonds.   He's right!   And D'Arby shuffled the deck...   How did you...   I can tell you the entire deck.   Star Platinum sawthe order of the cards   when they were shuffled.   Very interesting.   But all I have to do is shuffle the cards   where you can't see them.   Don't you get it?   It's not going to be so easyfor you anymore   to cheat with me as your opponent.   Just something I thoughtyou should know.   Good.    EPISODE   :D'ARBY THE GAMBLER, PART     The security seal.   An unbroken seal means the deckhas not been tampered with.   One joker.   I don't see anything unusual.   It's a normal deck.   The page number is    ...      ... No, page    .   Hasn't failed me yet.   I can tell which page it issimply by touch.   Jotaro's Star Platinum may haveincredible visual prowess,   but I can remembereverything by touch.   I know the exact locationof every card, shuffled or not.   OK! Open the game!   Ten of hearts.   Seven of clubs.   I'll be dealing then.   I need to shuffle the cards atan angle Star Platinum won't see.   Cut the deck.   And now I'll deal.   Jotaro... Me...   What? What happened?   Jotaro, his finger!   Star Platinum just brokeD'Arby's finger!   I told you.   You won't be cheating anymore.   He tried to cheat? When?He was just dealing the cards...   I didn't see him doanything suspicious.   No. Take a good look at the cardsin his left hand.   The second card is sticking out...   That's the cardhe tried to deal me.   He pretended to deal the top card,   but was about to deal methe second card from the top.   Which means...   The top card would havegone to him.   He would've had three tenswith that card.   The so-called second deal.   A sleight-of-hand technique   in which the dealer dealsthe second card in the deck,   instead of the expectedtop card deal.   Performed by an expert,the cheat is almost imperceptible.   What's more,   D'Arby knows the location ofevery card in the deck by touch.   You trash.How dare you break my finger...   I was being nice.   You're lucky I didn't rip it off.   Good grief. I guess I can't let youcut the deck anymore.   Someone else is going do itfrom now on.   That boy over there on the hilllooks like he could help.   Good.   Avdol, ask him to come here.   Certainly.   Impressive...   To cheat successfully, one mustexploit the element of surprise.   It takes more than sharp eyesto prevent that.   It appears I underestimated you,given you caught my second deal.   I'll accept my fractured fingeras punishment.   And now, I'll devote my fullconcentration to our game, Jotaro.   I haven't done so since my colossalgamble on May   th,     ...   against a Japanese manknown as Shozo Mayama.   I won his eight Tokyo properties,and his soul!   His wealth had not dulledhis gambler's instincts.   I'm not here for Lord Dio.   I'm here becauseI was born to be a gambler!   What do you think you're doing?   Those are Mr. Joestar'sand Polnareff's souls!   I've split their soulsinto six chips each.   In poker,if you think you might lose,   you can fold.   You need to be able to drop outand up the ante,   so we can't playwith just two chips.   Winning back six chips,   is the equivalentto winning one soul.    Got it?    Now, Jotaro. If we play, you'll getyour chance to win back the chips.    But I still haven'theard you say it.    Fine. I'll bet my soul.    Good!    Jotaro...    Those pure white chipsrepresent your soul.    Once I win all six,    your soul is mine.     OSIRISD'ARBY ELDER    I'll bet one chip of Polnareff's soul.    Let's begin!    In this game of poker,each player is dealt five cards.    Players have one chance to improvetheir hand by swapping out cards.    But it's the betting that makespoker a game of psychology.    Now then, I suppose I'll raise.    Keep in mind Jotaro, those sixwhite chips are your soul.    Think before you make your move.    Listen, it's okayif you don't understand.    You don't have to worry.    Just cut and deal the cardsthe way you know how.    OK...    Give me three cards.    My, my, that's quitethe frightful glare.    You must have a very good hand.    I guess I'll play it safeand bet one more Polnareff.    Call.    If you don't fold, you needat least three chips per game.    All right! Come on, Jotaro!    Two pair, eights and nines.    Oh, sorry.    Two pair, jacks and queens.    That was close.I almost lost that one.    So then...    He has only three left.    Jotaro...    OK, next game. Deal the cards.    Only the next gamemay be your last.    One card.    What's wrong, Jotaro?    Hurry up and look at your hand.    Decide whetheryou'll change or fold.    Jotaro?    No...    these cards will do.    What?    Um, pardon me...    What was that?    I think I misheard you.    I could have sworn I heard you say"these cards will do."    You heard right. These cards will do.    I'll play with this hand.    I know that!    I'm asking if you intend to    play those cardswithout looking at them.    These cards will do.    Don't mess with me! Answer me!    How can you play withoutlooking at the cards?    Avdol, I have a favor to ask.    A favor?    Of course, but why won't youlook at your cards?    Answer me, Jotaro!    I'll raise you another two and...    I'll throw in Avdol's soul.    Wh...    What?    D'Arby, you are impressive.    Sure, you're no matchfor our Stands physically,    but you're cunning andcalm under pressure.    I'm no gambler.You could read me like a book.    I would certainly loseagainst the likes of you.    But I trust Jotaro.    I don't know whyhe won't look at his cards,    but if he asks me for my soul,I won't waver.    My soul is in Jotaro's hands.    I see...    Seems you both have crackedunder the pressure.    Boy!    I said "one card"!Hurry up and deal me!    Yes, sir...    Master D'Arby,I dealt just as you asked.    His hand is worthless.I'm sure of it.    My skills as a dealer never fail.    You've won. I know it!    Jotaro thinks the boyhas nothing to do with us.    But everyone in this café    and everyone within sightof this place is my associate!    Even the bartender andthose men over there!    No matter who deals, I can't fail!    My directive is infallible.Jotaro's hand has to be a weak one.    Though, admittedly, not lookingat the cards was a bold move.    He caught me by surprise,albeit briefly...    It's a bluff!How dare he bluff against me?    Does he really think I'll fold?What a fool...    Very well.    I'll match you with six Polnareffs.    And...    I raise you Joseph's soul!    A total of fifteen chips!    What?    What? Hold on a minute!    Jotaro doesn't have any more chips!    He's out of chips, you say?Of course he does.    What do you mean?    All my Stand needsis a written contract.    Then it will be ableto take a soul.    Whose soul could yoube talking about?    Did you forget about your friendKakyoin, in the hospital?    -You can bet his soul!-What?    Panic, fool!    Show me your doubt and fear!    Let me see you losethat cool composure!    How dare he try tobluff against me?    I'll destroy him.    I'll turn that poker face intoa miserable ball of anguish!    Fine.    I'll see you with Kakyoin's soul.    Jotaro!    You can't bet a man's soulwithout his knowing!    I guess it is kind of selfish.    Hey, Jotaro! What did you just do?    What did I do?What are you talking about?    You just lit a cig...    What's wrong? Not feeling well?    This little...    Such confidence! Could he have...    Could he have used Star Platinumto swap the cards without my knowing?     I, JOTARO KUJO, AGREE TO SURRENDERTHE SOUL OF MY FRIEND NORIAKI KAKYOIN     IN THE EVENT THAT I LOSE.JOTARO KUJO    Stupid brat!    Don't look at mewith that worried grimace!    If Jotaro finds outyou work for me, I'll m*rder you!    Damn fool!    I have four kings.    The only hands that couldb*at me are four aces,    a straight flush,or a joker-led five of a kind.    To get any one of those hands,    Jotaro would haveto switch all five cards.    Sure, with Star Platinum's speed,    there's a chance he could haveswitched one of the cards.    But five? Could he have switchedall the cards right under my nose?    No! Completely impossible!    There's no way I could have missedhim replacing all five cards.    Not the great D'Arby!    All right, Jotaro!Your time's come!    He lit a cigaretteto psych me out! He's bluffing!    You got a drink? When did you...    You bastard!How dare you mock me?    Come on, let's do this!    My hand is--    Hold it.    I haven't raised the pot yet.    What?    Raise?    You don't have anything to...    I'll raise you my mother's soul.    What?    Your mother?Jotaro, you're betting Holly's soul?    I came to Egypt to save my mother.    If I lose here, she'll die anyway.She won't mind if I bet her soul!    Now D'Arby,    you better bet somethingthat matches my mother's soul.    I want you...    to tell me the secret of Dio's Stand!    He knows...    He knows Dio's secret.    But Dio does nottake lightly to treason.    If he tells us,D'Arby's as good as dead.    Jotaro... If you're that confident,    you know your hand will win,don't you?    You wouldn't let us down,would you?    You've got the winning hand,right? Jotaro?    Well? Call or fold?    Spit it out already, D'Arby!    I'll say it!    I'll say it, damn it!    I'll say it!    I'm the world's greatest gambler!    I can do this! I'll call!    Call...    I'm going to call!    Ca...    C... Ca... C...    I can't! I'm petrified!I'm speechless!    I'm too terrified...The words won't come!    C...    I can't breathe...    C... Ca...    Ca...    His eyes rolled back...    He fainted on his feet!    The pressure was just too much.    Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's soulsare returning to their bodies!    Thank God!    Inside, he had already given up.    Deep down, he knew he had lost.That's why the souls were released.    Four kings?    He had four kings!    Jotaro, what was your hand?    I knew it...    Your hand was sh*t!    Even Star Platinumwouldn't have been able to    swap cards in front ofan expert gambler like D'Arby.    Luckily my bluff and intimidation worked.    But with such a worthless hand...    Good grief. Had I known,I would've freaked.    Freaked?    Jotaro, you bet our soulson that worthless hand?    His collection of souls appearsto have been released.    Come on, everyone!Let's play mahjong!    Backgammon is a lot of fun, too.    And, oh,I love a good game of dice.    Even if you have no chance!    D'Arby, User of the Osiris Stand.Status: Retired    I doubt we'll be able to getDio's secret out of him now.    He was a formidable opponent.    He almost singlehandedlytook us all out.    He was impressive.    Yes, he was fierce.    Ugh, what just happened?    Guess we can't be the heroesevery episode.    My daughter's conditionhas worsened.    I was talking about you.    Not prepared? Don't lie to me!    Women make you do that.    You saved my life!    Mondatta and Hol Horsewill be an invincible duo!
