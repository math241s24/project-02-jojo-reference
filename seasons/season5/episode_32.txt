There are no hits.Gio: Even if the boss had a previous record, odds are he made sure it was erased.Bruno: But it has to be somewhere...Bruno: That's why he tried to eliminateJoJo-main: ,his own daughter and fears letting anyone know what he looks like.Gio: Why don't we look through the records of the dead?Gio: The boss might've faked his own death.Bruno: Let's give it a sh*t.Trish: We can't let him get away with this.Trish: A moment ago, just for a little while, I felt the same thing I felt in Venice.Trish: The one who got close to Abbacchio was...JoJo-main: ,my father.Trish: This man finished Abbacchio with his own hands.Bruno: Are you saying that the boss is here, Trish?Trish: Yes.JoJo-main: ,I don't know where he is right now, but he's nearby.Gio: Bucciarati!Bruno: Not right now!Bruno: If we don't find out the boss's identity for sureJoJo-main: ,and k*ll him, we're going to lose.Bruno: We have to track down his identity first!Gio: No hits.Bruno: It's no use... The boss is meticulous.Bruno: It's impossible to track him down any farther...Man: That's not true!Man: You have already tracked him down.JoJo-main: ,What?Man: All that's left now is to find a way to defeat him.JoJo-EpTitle,Sign: Episodio  Get to the Roman Colosseum!Man: I've been waiting so longMan: for people like you, who'd do everything they could to track this man down!Crunch,Sfx: {\fad(,)\c&HBDBD&\c&HD&}ScreechBruno: Someone tracked us down instead!JoJo-main: ,Giorno, cut the connection, quick!Man: Wait!

Let's hear what you have to say.Bruno: First, tell us your name.Man: My name doesn't matter.Man: My body is already in a state that prevents me from fighting.Man: What's important is whether or not you are actually able to defeat him.Man: His ability to erase time has no weaknesses.Man: I'm sure you're planning to assassinate him,Man: but you are certain to fail!Bruno: Are you saying you know ofa way to defeat the boss?Man: His Emperor Crimson is invincible!Man: But I do know of a slight possibility to defeat him.Man: It's just a possibility, though.Man: You will have to obtain that possibility.Bruno: Obtain it?Man: Come to me. Come to Rome!Man: If you do that, I can give you this possibility!Bruno: Do you really think we'll go to you?We don't even know if we can trust you.Man: I'm sure at least some of you know what this is.Crunch,Sfx: {\fad(,)\c&HBE&\c&H&}Scr{\c&HBA&}e{\c&HCFF&}echGio: That's...JoJo-main: ,the arrow!Gio: At least, it looks just like it!Bruno: Why do you have that?Man: I'll tell you that later.Man: You must come to my location to retrieve this.Man: He doesn't know the true way to use this arrow.Man: This arrow doesn't just awaken Stand abilities in people.Man: There is hidden wisdom within it.Man: I will tell you what it is.Man: Come to Rome.Man: This arrow will defeat him.Man: It is your last and only hope!Dop: Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...Dop: Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...Dop: Hey, you there!Dop: What the heck do you think you're doing, answering my phone?!Dop: That call's for me!Dop: Give it here! You stupid brat!Dop: Hello? Yes, this is Doppio!Boss: It's strange, Doppio.Dop: What is, Boss?Boss: Bucciarati and his crew.Boss: They've lost Abbacchio, so they should be at a loss as to what to do now.Boss: But that's not the case.Boss: They've fled with no hesitation whatsoever.Boss: They're on that boat with a goal in mind.Boss: Look into it.Boss: Return to Abbacchio's last location and look around.Boss: Something's not right.Dop: Look around?JoJo-main: ,But what am I supposed to look for?Boss: Fear is bornJoJo-main: ,from an unexpected past.Boss: This is what I've been fearingJoJo-main: ,ever since I found out that I had a daughter.Dop: There's nothing suspicious, boss.Dop: The statue's been destroyed, but that it.Boss: I know it. I can tell.Boss: Those traitors... There's no doubt about it.Boss: They figured something out that I don't know about.Dop: They figured something out?Dop: What could it be? They didn't have that kind of time.Boss: It's something that I'd never expect!Boss: That's enough, Doppio.Boss: Go after them immediately.Boss: You have to track them down yourself.Dop: Yes, sir!Boss: Also...JoJo-main: ,Cioccolata and Secco...Boss: Have them stop Bucciarati and his crew.Boss: I didn't want to ask for help from such filth, but I have no other choice.Boss: This is the last time.Boss: Listen well, Doppio. One must destroy their fear.Boss: The moment is now.Boss: We must get through this right now, no matter what.Boss: That is what it means to be alive.Nara: Who the heck is this guy waiting for us in Rome?Nara: Can we really trust him?Mista: Who knows? But Bucciarati decided we're going.Mista: What other options do we have?Man: Let me tell you a little story from the past.Man: In Greenland, there's a place called Cape York where only Inuit people live.Man: It's famous for having a crater created by a meteorite.Man: It's said to have fallen tens of thousands of years ago.Man: In ...Man: Two men from a team that was surveying for natural resources within the craterMan: contracted an unknown illness.Man: They both ended up with blisters all over their bodies,Man: and eventually, they diedlooking like tomato sauce.Man: On top of that, one of them suddenly sh*t a jolt like a stun g*n from his fingerMan: and accidentally b*rned a few fingers off the doctor treating him.Man: In later investigations, it was discovered that a virus,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,which was tens of thousands of years old, had been trappedJoJo-internal/narrator: ,within the meteorite inside the crater.Man: That virus may have flown here on the meteorite.Bruno: A virus?JoJo-main: ,What about it?Man: I tracked it down!Man: This arrow is made from the same material as the meteorite found in Cape York!Man: Centuries ago, a man who craved absolute power like that of the godsMan: found out about this rock and created arrows from it. This is one of them.Man: This k*ller virus culls lifeforms.Man: This is a theory called "viral evolution."Man: Most people who contract this virus will die,Man: but some possess something that lets them survive.Man: And as if it were rewarding them,Man: the virus gives them a new life ability.Man: This has already been proven, with your own bodies.Gio: So that's what Stands are...Man: That is the root and principle of that arrow.Bruno: I see. I understand that now.Bruno: But what's this secret way of using the arrowJoJo-main: ,that we're supposed to retrieve?Man: I can't tell you that until you come see me in Rome.Man: On top of that, I can only tell one of you what it is.Man: Because no one else can ever find out about this secret power.Man: But once you find out that method,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,I guarantee that it will take you to another dimension.Man: It is the only way to defeat Emperor Crimson.Bruno: There's no guarantee that your story is true.Bruno: But if the boss hears about this, he's definitely going to eliminate you.Bruno: I'll trust you.Bruno: How do you want to meet?Man: Come to the Colosseum in Rome.Man: Once you get there, you'll know.Man: It doesn't matter what time. I'll be waiting.Man: Everything will be revealed there.Drunk : Come on! Get up, damn it!Drunk : Shut up!

A former doctor.Nar: About two years ago, he let a patient die due to a simple mistake.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,Once he was laid off from the hospital, Passione took him in.Nar: He could be considered a failed elite,Nar: but the boss found out his true nature after he became a Stand user.Nar: It wasn't malpractice.JoJo-internal/narrator: ,He had k*lled patients on purpose.Nar: He diagnosed countless people who were perfectly healthyJoJo-internal/narrator: ,as being sick and operated on them.Nar: He'd reduce the anesthesia so the patients would wake up during surgery, as well.Nar: Ever since he was a young boy, he had always gotten top grades.Nar: When he was fourteen, he volunteered to take care of the elderly.Nar: However, in reality, he was administeringJoJo-internal/narrator: ,unknown dr*gs to the elderly people he looked after.Nar: Also...cio: Your family hates you.cio: No one's going to come visit you.Nar: He would say things like that every day,Nar: driving people to su1c1de.Nar: On his bookshelf at home,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,he had  video tapes of the expressions the elderly madeJoJo-internal/narrator: ,when he told them those things.Nar: After driving nine elders to su1c1de,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,he decided he'd become a doctor.Nar: The thing that Cioccolata loved most was to observe people dying.Nar: The reason he became a doctor was so he could observe people's pain and death.Nar: While watching someone die,JoJo-internal/narrator: ,he felt superior to the rest of humanity,Nar: and felt as though he truly understood the psychology of the human race.Nar: Cioccolata's one and only partner was Secco.Nar: The only thing known about him is that he's Cioccolata's former patient.Nar: For some reason, they got along, and Secco only follows Cioccolata's orders.Nar: Even among the various Stand users that exist within Passione,Nar: this duo stands out as a pair of monsters.Nar: That's who Cioccolata and Secco are.Dop: It appears that their destination is Rome, boss.Dop: I just received word that they arrived at a local fishing village.Boss: Listen well, Doppio.Boss: Have Cioccolata stop and eliminate Bucciarati and his crew.Boss: But... you must catch up to those two, no matter what.Boss: Those two... yes.JoJo-main: ,It's rare that I ever feel repulsed by others,Boss: but Cioccolata is the worst piece of sh*t on the face of the earth.Boss: He'll probably make a mess of Rome before he's done.Dop: So you think he'll go berserk?Boss: That's why you're going to catch up to them, Doppio.Boss: You must take control in the end.Boss: You must not let those two find out what Trish knows,JoJo-main: ,nor what Bucciarati and his crew are looking for in Rome.Boss: You're the only one I can trust.Boss: Do you understand? You're number one.Dop: I understand, boss.Dop: That is what I live for.Dop: Sorry, was that call too long?Dop: Thank you very much, little girl.Girl: Um, hewwo?Nara: What the hell is that, Mista?!
